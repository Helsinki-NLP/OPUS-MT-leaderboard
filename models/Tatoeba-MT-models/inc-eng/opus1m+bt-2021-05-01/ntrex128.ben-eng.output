The Welsh Assembly members are worried about their own ‘likes like a map'
Among a number of Assembly members are fearful of changing their status to MWP (the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this panic is that Assembly has changed the name of the proposal for the West Parliament.
Members of various political parties are afraid to see the change in the face.
A Labor Party Assembly member said his team was worried that the Twp and Pwp of the New Year's Party met with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Welsh: In Welsh, Twp means stupid and Pwp means mal.
A plied assembly member says they are not a group of 3 people, and suggested alternatives.
One member of the Wellsh Conservative Party said that the group's change is considered to be 10khola, but notes that the difference between MWP and the size is relatively small.
In this sense, the English pronunciation of the wesh alphabet WW is like the urds of Yurkshar English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently planning to launch the rename process, says: The final decision for members of the 3 assemblies to take their own account of what will happen.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave Welsh Assembly the right to change their name.
In June, the Commission published a public opinion that changed the name of Assemboli and the proposal for the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the status of Assembly members, the Commission supports the Welsh Parliament's Mambar, or WMP, but the public has the highest support.
Apparently, the Assembly members suggest different options, but it would be difficult for the delivery officer, Elin Jones, to get to the unity of the law within a few weeks.
The Constitution of Parliament has various changes in the performance of Assembly, including the inability of the assembly members and the design of the committee.
After the debate regarding the issue, the Assembly members will be able to make a final vote about what their position should be.
Messedonians vote for the country's name change.
The voters will right the vote on Sunday to decide whether their country's name will be changed to 7 Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was made to avoid the decades of conflict by neighboring state Greece, who has its own Macedonian province.
Athens has long claimed that its neighbor's name of the north is a symbol of the demand for their territory and that it has repeatedly criticized the European Union and members of Nato for the appeal.
President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who is against democracy about name change, says he will reject the Republic.
Although, supporters of the Republic, including Prime Minister Jorn Zaev, think that the name change is only a step needed to join the European Union and Nato.
St. Martins of Harlem's Church is silent for hours.
3 The old men I talked to said that there was a church and a cup of tea in each corner, said Mr. Adams.
There's no one else today.
He says it's understood to be missing the cup.
The social networks of 3 people today are in a different way.
5 Panchas are no longer in the area, where everyone goes on a regular basis.
In the church, he is concerned that the money he sells, the leaders don't have to continue as long as they think it will be, and today and tomorrow, they will return to where they started.
He adds that the apartment building and condominium can be built in the place of the church where people will live who will not help the rest of the neighborhood.
The majority of those who buy condominium in this building will be whitetang, saying they will wait for the day when these churches are closed because most of the people who live in the condominium are at risk of being part of the church.
Herlem was founded by both the Church of Saints in 1974, before he became a blackishing giant, and a decade later, the Metropolitan Community, and St. Martins.
The Church left the Church in 1914.
A black congregation in nearby worship took possession of the building.
Under Reverend John Howard Johnson, a black congregation took over St. Martins, who led a box against salesmen in Andrade and Toenty Fifth Street because of their refusal to hire and resign black workers.
The building was badly damaged by a fire crash in 1989, but the residents of the Farae Johnson planned to restore it, and they managed to build the Carolynn.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and Carolyn, inheriting at St. Martins, gave 13 hours of hours to the 13th class of people.
The expert Carolyn, who played it last July, called it something different: 1 is historical wealth, and 4-apparent historical attractions.
Experts, Tiffany Nyang, University of Michigan, also said that it is the world's Orthm Carolin, an environmentally cultivated carrien, which is designated to play a greater Caroline in the Riverside Church 15 years ago.
Mr. Maryvender said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martins last few months is a critical event of the Church's general leaders or Episopal diocese.
Vestri, the Governoring Body of Paris, made up of general leaders, told them of their concern that they would transfer 25 pounds of money to the diocese Vestri, although the duty of the diocese was not involved.
Some members of Paris have accused Diosis of lack of transparency in their work.

As part of the main effort to access the commercial market of 2.9 billion pounds of the United Kingdom, these huge fraternity items will be launched at the country's 25 shops and will be successfully launched in other shops, with the rise in the market of fashion and household resources.
These investments are coming in in fashion as Supermarkets are at once looking for new ways to fill shells full of TV, microwaves and home equipment.
Censburys said it would multiply its flasks to more than 300 pieces, which will be the first time in which Ravalon, EG, Twittererman, and Dr. P.
Like Laurel, Mebelin, and Barts Bij, there will be more room for the already-used modern ranges, such as boots.
Supermarkets are launching the bootyk makeup range, which has become very popular among young customers.
In turn, Perfum vendor The French Shop will run a payroll on two Sinsberis shops, which first started last week in Kreydon in South London, and the second year's end will be at Birmingham's Sele Oak.
Buying a small amount of food in shops and local currency stores online means that supermarkets are going to be forced to make an extra effort.
Mike Kup, the chief executive of the Sensburys, said that the outlets should look like the Department Store as the Supermarket chain competes with the abandoned shop and will have more services and food products.
The company claims that Argos and Habitats have been operating outlets in hundreds of stores since they bought two years ago, and that some Habitats and other Habitats, which have grown in trade and have made the acquisition more profitable.
The attempt failed before the supermarkets were covered with comets and the Farmsy Department.
Cinnsburys tested a joint project with Fike Boots in the early 1980s, but the project closed down because of conflict about how the benefits from the company's market in the supermarkets were to be abandoned.
The new strategy is coming up after the owner of the factory of Censbury, their 48 shop, sold to Lloyds Farms' owner, Selesio.
The company reports that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a luxury range of the Skincare Brand, including La Rose Pose and Vishi in four shops.
Paul Mills-Heiks, the commercial director of Sensburys, says: “We changed our tools to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also spent special training workers who will be present for advice.
Our brand range has been planned to address all the needs of our brands, and because of the attractive environment and facilities, we are now becoming a reliable focal point that will challenge the old ways of Kanakater.

Other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks, did not have access to the number of people who broadcast the program, including the PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks.
And Nielsen usually faces problems with the quality of the audience sitting in the office.

He was wearing his head down for a few minutes in the voice of the protesters who broadcast CNN directly.
I'm standing right in front of you, a woman says.
Do you think Kavana is telling the truth to the country?
He is told, you have power when many women are helpless.
Flake said that his office made a statement and before the elevator was closed, he said there was something else he could say in the committee hearing.
Later, when Kavana was voted by the Judith Committee to proceed to the full Senate vote, the cables and broadcast networks were all broadcast directly.
But Flake said he would vote in the terms that the FBI will investigate the charges against the electorate in the following week, asking for the majority of democrats.
She was partially affected by her conversation with Chris Kun, a friend Democratic Senator after Fleke's approval.
After talking to Kun, Flake spoke to several more senators and came to her conclusion.
Fleke's decision was due to the fact that the Republicans did not vote to approve Kavana without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation based on charges against Kavana.

Earlier on Thursday, European League Rangers will give us good news to Rapid Vienna.
Livingston has already played six games to be defeated in the Division, the chief Coch Holt, who has been replaced by Kenny Miller, has not yet won the prize.
Livingston missed a number of chances against their unresolved opponents.
They should have gone ahead long before the Holt’s team was shot, as their aggressive attitude caused all kinds of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson's resolution differed but failed to produce his efforts, so Allan Lithgo can only run his attempt on the side to match the header of the Craig Hulttt.
Since guests could have trouble with Set Pess, hosts were allowing the Rangers to play in front of them.
And the strategy was the important one.
Rangers had a free-key considing and opening up the Livingstone Gollows to set up the Declan Galagar and Robinson Manga, who moved from the center of a Tache box.
At this point, Rangers had authority over the ball, but they were aware of the disparity of the sponsor's degree and have spent most of the time with the Gollor Liam Kelly.
The line continued until the second time, although Alfredo was holding a shot of Morlos Kali.
Scott Pittman was caught by Alan McGregor of Rangers, and he won another set of Peace for Livingston from Lithgo Wide.
The cross was constantly coming into the Livingston box and continuing to be clear, although the two Penalts were demanding - alternative Glenn Middleton was hired after the Hitler challenge and handleball.
‘Invincible' Kitty Livingston - Analysis
Alsadar Lalmont Tony McKarney, Scotland.
Livingston has an amazing performance and results.
To a person, they were miserable, they continued to hope for everyone at their peak.
Their game styles and players have changed very little since they returned to the top level, but since they have to go to the credit hotel for the way he has dealt with the group.
He had a lot of heroies.
Captain Hulttt was extraordinary, built a highly organized defense, and kept the Manga Conr Goldson and Jo Warl constantly.
Although Rangers' inspiration was low.
They were as good as they were under Jared.
Their lack of Finals - only once they exposed the visitors - and it is a warning for Rangers who are now on the middle table.

The incident in the summer low-income Arizana, however, seems to be the same as the beginning of the next week when Hariken Roza will stand up with his remaining power across the southwest desert with the risk of the sudden flood.
The National Weather Office has already issued a flash slide watch in the South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Saltlake City cities.
Rosa is expected to reach the rains on Tuesday on Phoenix and on Monday.

Caterina (19977) was a rickshaw between the 60-miles of a Jade border.
Models of the last National Hariken Center predicted the rainfall from 8 to 20 inches, the Mogalon Reme of Arizona, which can be divided up to 10 inches.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including Central Rockies and Great Basin, have the potential to rain from 8 to 20 inches apart.
People outside the danger of flooding can be blessed with rain because the regions are devastated
Although the floods are a serious concern, it is likely that some of the rainfall is suffering from drought in the south-west.
According to the U.S. survey, over 60 percent of Arizona's deaths were reported as a second highest cataggery, Wedar Dotcom.
First, Harkin Rosa's route will cause the earthquake across the Gulf of California, Mexico.

Trump says the Cavana Democratic Party has been called \"The Cruelty, Anger\"
One of Hullings in West Virginia, who said that a vote for Kavana, was a vote against the Democratic Party's design and aggressive strategy.
Trump said that Kavana was offered to the Democratic Party 'smpathies, angers' across her monotonous process.
Kavaanh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, with bitterness and emotion, refusing to accuse Christine Blasy Ford that he suffered sexual abuse in his hands decades ago when he was a teenager.
Ford also testified to his accusation.
President Saturday said that 15 Americans saw Kavanah's wonderful qualities and courage on that day.
To supporters of West Virginia, he said that a vote for Zaz Kavanah would be a vote to protect a lawyer, including the Jonsab Starling Record.
The president apparently acknowledged Kavana's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican voting in the middle of elections.
Only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not taking part, but I'm really taking part.
This is why I'm always trying to fight for the worst candidates.

In Indonesia's earthquake, tens of thousands of deaths in tsunamis are being witnessed to, toll growth.
At least 40 people were killed and many reported that the authorities reported that they had fallen into the lake as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
Thousands gathered for a festival at the sea beach in Palu on Friday, when six meters (22 feet) broke down in the evening, which led many to their deaths and destroyed everything on the way.
The tsunami comes after a 7.5-million earthquake.
The people continued their activities at the sea and became a victim of those who were not able to run and have been the victims of the recent threat of tsunamis, says BNPB's spokesperson Sutopo old Nugroho Jakarta in a brifing.
3 Sunami didn't come from her own, it pulled the car, the log, the home, it hit all that was on the ground, and 2 nugroho adds that the tsunami traveled about 300 km (97 km) in the open sea before they hit the shore.
Some people went to the trees to survive the tsunami and they survived.
About 1,700 people have been moved to 4 stations in the Palu.
Images taken from the sky by the disaster agencies show that many have been destroyed by building and shops, bridges broke and broken down and a mosque was lit in water.
The apartments also stand in the coastal town on Saturdays.
The series of earthquakes felt more than 1.5 million people in the affected region.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPT) said that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of nuclear bomb blast in the second world war.
The city's geographic location, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, can cause the size of the tsunami to rise.
Nogroho describes the damage as a 12-billion that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been damaged.
Some of the affected deaths have been found to be trapped under the ruins of the building, and he adds that there are 35 injured and 3 missing people.
Nogroho reported that the tragedy and damage could be more devastating in a region near Danggala, a region near the earthquake's center, from the north of Peru, 300 kilometers (90 miles) north of Palau.
Communication was completely broken without any information. Nogroho says.
There are more than 8,000 people living there, 3rd Cross stated in a statement, and added that workers and volunteers are going to the affected region.
8AT is already a trazedy but it can be worse.
The Saturday Agency was heavily criticized for not giving the information that Sunami attacked Palu, even though officials said there were waves on the alert.
A man on the floor of a football building shared on social media has been seen to hear a warning before the tsunami on the bottom of the street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water suffocated into the shores and broke up the building and the car.
Reuters did not immediately prove the footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused electricity explosions that disrupted communication around the pulour and made the rescue of the authorities uncomfortable.
The military has started to launch the Cargo planes in support of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have reported that rescuers now need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport is just restarted for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodor was supposed to visit the asylum centers of Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to over 500.
It's too dangerous.
According to Mr. Doseber, when the world organization's workers went safely from Donggala to the city of Palu, where the employee Ra was looking for shelter in their office, they saw the picture of disaster on the way.
Doseba also reported that 3 people saw that many homes were destroyed.
It's sad.
Even when the aid groups were going to start the disaster relief program, some complained that with many skills foreign aid workers were being forced to travel to escape.
In Indonesia, economics, food supplies, and staff can come from the country only when a disaster is announced as a national disaster zone.
But it hasn't been announced yet.
Aulia Ariani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross, says it's still a state crisis.
If the government once said yes, it's a national scale disaster, then we can start international assistance, but there's still no announcement.
The second night of the tsunami hit Palu on Friday, the missing friends and family members look forward to the miraculous events that will bring them hope to find them at the end of a creative chapter of the natural disaster.
A little boy is taken from the nursema on Saturday.

Mr. Mendagy also notes that those who were trapped at the Rawa Rawa Hotel were his students.
He also said that I have my own feelings as a progress in the 3 pharaohling field.
Mr. Jenden remembers how the news about the destruction of the Raa Raa Hotel spread to the paragliding community about an hour after it was destroyed, spreading it to the Palu competitors through the message of the Hutsapp, who took part in a festival on the beach.
Although his message was not read, his message was unreceptive.
He said, 3 means that the message was not sent.

That's why I'm you, I'm ours. That's what we are.
From Cain, which means the only person, it reflects our good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects more on our identity.
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their names.
Shawn Combus is known in various ways as Pf Daddy, PDD, or DD, but this year he announces that the profit and Braders' profit name are much more desirable.
J-G, O Hifen, a former assistant in West, worked on the capital.
ML, Mexico, has sworn that the military will not apply to ordinary citizens.
Andres Manuel Lopez, the selected president of Mexico, took an oath on the 50th anniversary of the violence against students that he would not force civilians to take military force against them.
On Saturday, López Abrador, Tolatelloko promises Plaza that the people of Mexico will not use military power to torture them.

In the United States, twice as much money should be given to artificial intelligence.
China, like artificial intelligence, has become more active in the United States and in the field of research, has twice the amount of money spent in this research by artificial intelligence researchers and investors Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
From various parts of the government, the U.S. announced that the United States has official strategy gaps in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has launched their new plan last year: its goal is to acquire 2 places in the production of artificial intelligence by 2015.
Lee adds that twice the budget will be a good start in research of artificial intelligence where most countries are behind this and we're looking for the next step to progress in artificial intelligence.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said this.
Lee, whose book is 13al Superpowers: 'China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order' is the head executive of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Cinnovation Venter, who is one of China's most famous artificial intelligence agency Fes++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie served in a artificial intelligence system at the University of Mellon, which defeated the highest rank-ranked American player and was the president of the Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Li defense improved research project like the agency robotics challenge has acknowledged the technology competition in the previous US government for the next step.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government donations, Lee says.
3 China is not removing the Academy of Leaders; corporates are giving out, 4 Lee says.
Facebook, Google, and other technology organizations have been assigned from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that change of immigration policy can help improve the USI effort.
3 I think the Green Card should be automatically assigned to PHD in artificial intelligence, saying that SI's efforts have increased.
China's State Council has launched a artificial intellectual development plan for his next generation in July 2017.
People of the Chinese National Science Foundation Academy, such as National Science Foundation and other government organizations, provide funding for US researchers, but there is a low rate of academic work in China, says Lee.
In the beginning of this year, the United States Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which announces the formation of the election committee on art and academic participants, and the White House's artificial intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced a $16 billion investment in an initiative called AI NEXT.
As the NSF, it currently invests more than $6 million per year in artificial intelligence research.

Macedonians voted on whether they should change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonian people changed their name to Republic of North Macedonia and voted on whether to keep it, a move that would solve a few decades of long-term conflicts with Greece, which hindered the efforts of European Union and Nato's membership.
Greece, where there is a province of Macedonia, represents a demand for its territory and has breached the access to Nato and the European Union.
Two governments have made a deal on the basis of the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents think that the change will provoke the ethnic identity of the majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov says he won't vote in public opinion and suspected that he would pay 50 percent of the minimum required for public opinion polls in the polling campaign.
The question was: \"You are in charge of Nato and members of the European Union with the agreement with Greece.\"
Supporters of changing the name with Prime Minister Jorn Zaev expressed an argument about the value of the European Union and Nato institution for one of the Macedonians from the fall of Yugoslavia.
3 For the future of the country today, I have come to vote for young people in Macedonia to escape the exploitation of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us, the 49-year-old Olivera Georgeska Skopje.
While the law is not mandatory, sufficient members of the parliament say they will follow the poll results by making decisions.
To change the name, you need two-thirds of the Constitution.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of Nagad Alam.
However, only 20 percent of the voter voters have been voted in comparison to the 2012 National Assembly elections, when 45% of registered voters were voted.
3 I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe, a voter in Skopje, the capital.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Jorn Zaev, his wife, Jorika, and his son, Dushko, have voted on changing the country's name to the republic in Macedonia, which will open the way to Nato and the European Union in Strumica in Macedonia. September, 2014.
Vladimir Kavardakov, who was 45 years old at the Skopje Parliament, was preparing a small stage and he was taking a chair in front of the tents to set up those who would delete the crowd.
We're in favor of Nato and the European Union, but we're not going to go through the service doors, but we want to drop our heads down.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us to Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia setting.
Prime Minister Zaev says that Nato Membership will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment rates are more than 20 percent.
5 I believe there will be a huge majority because more than 80% of our citizens said after giving him a ballot for the European Union and Nato.
He said that there will be a 10h 10 outcomes for our 3 future confirmation.
Last Monday, a poll published by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia stated that between 20 and 80 percent of voters will participate in the polls required for the tournament out of the country.
Another trial conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 47% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Meanwhile, 80 percent said they would vote yes.
In order to succeed, there must be more than 50 percent of votes.
The failure of the referendum will represent the first fatal strike in the Western government policy since its adoption of power in May last year.

On Saturday morning, Manchester City in Manchester, England, won the British Defence in 18-12, and broke up the Surgeo Aguaro and the Rheem Starlings.
Aguiro made it easier to see his score in the 60th minute.
At the beginning of the series, there was a pass in Midfield, Argentina Strayker.
He ran through three Briton Defender before he went to open the field.
Aguiro was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He's been driving a defender before moving a few more people across the border with the Briton box.
Then he pushed a pass to the left, who found the Starling.
Using his first touch in the English front box, he returned the ball to Aguoro, who used his right boot to beat the British guard Matthew Ryan to the right of the window.
2Aguareo is struggling with a few problems on his feet, telling journalists Pepp Gardiola, the City Manager.
We've been talking about his game for 6,500 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he made a round at the moment.
However, the Starlingai Sky Blues was given the primary advantage of the primary league fight.
That bullet came in 15 minutes.
Aguiro found the ball deep in the Britain area.

Sherger Spoleer wants to play Rockis Machee
After dismissing Nationals from the playoff's debate, there was no reason to force anyone else to start.
However, Chir's contestant Sherjeer hopes that he will take a mount against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if he is affected by the play-offs that take lead to Wan-Geem against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the NAL West.
Rockis got a place for the Wild card on Friday night after winning the Nationals in 15 to 20 miles a day, but they still want to get their first delivery tickets.
If we don't play for anything, at least we can get to Raber about the viewers of Denver and the other party will probably play on the top of any point I face this year.
Why don't I want to compete with it?
Nationals have not yet declared a starter for Sunday, but it has been said that Sherzer can get into such a situation.
Sherzar, who started his 60th, threw a Bullpen session on Thursday, and beat him in his usual restaurant on Sunday.
Washington's right to Washington's 4/7 in the city of 440 ERA and 45-seven-year-olds.
Transport in West Virginia
When speaking of the importance of the Republican vote in the middle of the election, the president strongly pointed out the situation around Bret Kavana, who was chosen by his Supreme Court.
4 Everything we've done is in danger of November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running because I'm moving around to fight for the worst candidates, he said.
The tramp continued, you see the Democratic group, the terrible Radical group, you're seeing it happening right now.
And they're strong enough to take the strength out of any way they need, you see this inferiority, cruelty.
They're hurt, they're going to get power and control, they're not giving anything, they just want power and control, and we won't give it to them.
He says the democrats are on the 10 missions to protest and hinder.
And you have seen that for the past four days, he says that the democrats have been described as 3 red and blue and black and faithless.
He called the Democratic Senator Dian Feinstein, a member of the Senate's judicial committee, who received a high-ranking ticket from the audience.
Do you remember the answers?
Did you file the case?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I wait, it's really bad body Language, the worst body I've ever seen.
Lebar is no longer a free organization.
Those who think they're not there to say what is in their mouths.
It wasn't surprising when the party Momentam officials accused me of making a vote in my area.
Because you don't have to welcome Boola's ability to express your feelings here - I was the latest Leder on the list.
My Parliamentary colleague Juan Ryan found similar behavior because he stood firm against Judaism.
In my case, I was blamed for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of a taxable economic policy, issues of Europe and national security and similar issues, which did not agree with previous leaders.
On Friday, Nottingham is noted for the East Labor Meeting that we want to organize and promote meetings.
In my eight years as a local Labor MP, this first Friday's GC meeting has been exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, it is not the beauty of that meeting and the promise of the \"Dalu, soft-hearted\" politics has been forgotten for a long time if it's ever true.
It is increasingly evidenced that there is no difference between the Labor Party and that every opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable to the team leadership.
It started after I became a German leader, which I thought I shared with colleagues the same political perspective that they began to expect me to take on the u-tarn and take the position that I would never accept - whether it was national security or the EU unit market.
As soon as I speak in public, and even if what I say doesn't matter - I'm invited to go through social networks, I'm condemned in the center politics, and I'm told that I shouldn't stay in the labor party.
And it's not my only experience.
Actually, I know that I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have directed to me are also political.
I'm surprised to see all the colleagues who face a storm of discrimination or ethnic violence on the basis of the gender, but never get ashamed of their profession and determination.
The most disappointing point in this period of politics is how Galagali’s poorness has become normal
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labor Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer free organizations, and each of the 12 non-states, which crush the party’s change of vote or election rules.
For the past two years, many have been recommending me to keep my head down, not so quiet, and I'll be right in it.
But I'm not going to do this in politics.
When I joined as a school school school in Lebar 20 years ago, we were expelled by the Tachhar government that literally destroyed our extended school classes, I tried to provide the most needed government services, whether it was the local council or the official minister.
I never hid my politics with the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East has ever been confused with my policy position and the areas of conflict with current leadership.
For those who have preached this protest Friday, I will only say that when the country is moving towards a bricket that will damage the family, business, and our public services, I cannot understand the desire to undermine my time and energy by showing loyalty to the leaders of the Labor Party.
But I really don't have a message for Nottingham Momentum, it's to my election centers, be a member of Labor: I'm proud of serving you, and I promise that no misfortune threats or political criticism will prevent me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP of Nottingham East.
Ayer 64-07 Melroz: Raised above the defeated Ayer
Two attempts at late-time might reduce the final result, but no doubt the great commercial tent of the tent of the first-time tingant was worth the victory.
They're now at the top of the table, only in ten.
By the end of the day, it was their best degree, their ability to take advantage, which helped to win the welcome team, and had a good reason to be pleased with Coach Peter Murchi.
We've been tested in every game so far and we're still missing, so I have to be happy.
Robbin Christy of Melrose said: \"I have to credit you, they've used their possibilities better than us.\"
The 20th-minute attempt of Grant Anderson, transformed by the Brazilian Climo, led to Ayar, however, a yellow card of Harry Hughes, the player in Scotland, who expelled him for games by the Variars, to make Melroz the majority, and Jason Baggot an unsuccessful attempt.

It's a task to restore.
All over the land Bolivia, the memory of the Hanani coast is still clear to Chile in fighting one of the bloody resources of the 19th century, just as it is possible to travel to the Pacific Ocean once more.
These hopes are probably the highest in decades, since Bolivia is waiting for the International Court on October 8, after five years of discussion.

The following year, I was baptized in symbol of my dedication to Jehovah and symbolized my dedication to him by water baptism.
However, some analysts believe that the court may not be able to decide on Bolivia -- and that would only change a bit if it were.
The Netherlands-based UN organization does not have the ability to land Chile and reports that they will not determine the consequences of possible discussion.
Only six months after ICJ's verdict came to a conclusion, it indicated that the case was not 1 critical, said by the Chilean International Law expert Paj Zeret.

Bolivia and Chile will be able to continue talking until a period of time, but it will be very difficult to discuss later.
Two countries did not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
The Heg's Bolivia representative, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, refused to make the court's decision unusual.
On Monday, there will be a wonderful opportunity for the new era to come to terms with Bolivia's 2Cyli, and a 2-year-old, with 2 p.m.
Calzadila also denies Morales - is still using one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - the Meritim issue as a political match.

John Edward: Language Skills Required for the World People
The independent schools in Scotland have been recording a track of the Academy's hierarchy, and it has continued to produce a more seemingly impossible test results in 2010, which only strengthened the efforts of sports, arts, music, and other communities by personal and combined success.
With more than 2,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to provide their students and parents with the highest level of service.
Individual schools aim to prepare their students more and higher education, as their selected professions and world citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we see the modern language in schools as a popular and desirable subject.
Nelson Mandela says: “If you talk to someone in a language he doesn't understand, it goes to his head.
If you speak to her in your own language, it goes to her heart.
It is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to make relationships and beliefs with other people.
From the latest test results of this year, we can see that languages are above the level of leg tables with the highest pass rate in individual schools.
A total of 40% of the highest grades among foreign - language students.
The information collected from the 60 members of the SCIS' school shows that 80 percent of students received high grade in Mandarin, when 80% of German studies, 39 percent of French studies and 80 percent of Spanish studies were acquired.
This proves that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as a vital skill that will be necessary in the future for children and young people.
The language is now being held in the same way as the content, the text of individual school and elsewhere (science, Technology, Strategies, and Mathematics).
The U.K. Commission for Development and Skills 2012 survey showed that officials responsible for fighting for zeros, more than 30 percent of their language skills.
So more than that, language skills are becoming necessary for young people to prepare for careers in their future.
These skills are needed in the global world for more potential tasks.
Whoever chooses the career, if they learn the second language, they will have the real advantage with their life-time skills in the future.
Having the ability to communicate directly to foreign people, automatically keeps a multilingual person before the competition.
Ugv of more than 2,000 adults in UK in 2010, surveyed that 80 percent of the students were unable to speak well in foreign languages during the conversation and that the French language was the only language for decades.
This is why it is important for children today to invest in language education.
Many languages, especially developing economics, provide better opportunities for children to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will separate the language they learn.
In a few schools, more classics will focus on modern languages, while in 2010, others will learn languages that seem to be most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a lot of languages to choose in individual schools, including expert learning staff.
Sketish individual schools are obliged to provide an education environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
It cannot be denied in global business environments at the moment that languages play an important role in the future of the country, it should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as true, the skills of international communication.
Individual schools will provide these preferences, diversity, and excitement for youth in Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent School

With his vote delay for conviction in order to meet the zero of the Supreme Court, the Trump is aimed at building support for the future mid-Mayaid election, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time is the West Virginia Assembly of Trump tonight, and how do you see online?
Trump's Hulling is scheduled at 8 p.m. night in West Virginia. It's Saturday, September 1, 2014.
You can see the West Virginia Assembly of Trump below through live streams on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about Brett Casana's election candidate this week, which has been raised by the alleged sexual abuse of the Senate during the FBI investigation.
However, help the Republicans achieve some speeds in face of the election of November.
In this way, President Trump's campaign said that the purpose of this five rally the following week was to force the 5 volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their numbers under the Senate and Representatives.
The control of Congress is so important for his agenda that as soon as we enter busy campaign season, the president will travel to the state as much as possible, a broadcaster of the Trump has told Reuters.
Huiling A Wesbenco is scheduled for Erena, today's conference can bring supporters from 2ohio and Pennsylvania and bring coverage from Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Since last month, the Trump has visited West Virginia for the second time, which he had won in 2010 with over 80 percent of the points.
With the tramp election in front of the West Virginia Republican Senate trying to help Patrick Morris, who is behind the ban.
According to Reuters, politician Simon Hedar at the University of West Virginia said that it is not a good indication of the president's attempt to raise him further in the election.
Ridder's Cup 2012: The hunger for battle to keep hope alive on Sunday's unit.
At the end of the three isolated sessions, the radio cup was needed on Saturday's forefront.
The Doll of Pendulum, Momentum, is a full-founded sport idea but it is a fact that players believe, and the most important of the national competition.
So where do they say Momentum now?
One of the six points had a lead, and now it's four, so I think we have a little room to walk for the day.
Europe has advantages, of course, to continue playing more than four points.
As Spyth said, Americans think they have some help on their way and can be encouraged by a lot of things, especially the forms of the Spyth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and took three points from four to three.
From the beginning to the end, the Spirit was fatal and led from the front to the end.
He was becoming more loud in celebrating with his rounds, while he and Thomas were still on two points after he had two scores, he made an important part of carrying the entire square match in four points.
The match that he won in Patty 8 found the same kind of noise that most told you that he believed the American team was not out of it.
You have to go deep in the truth and think about your match, 5th said.
Each of these players has it now.
10 holes to mark one.
More than two days ago, the player was the only story of Francisco Molinary and Tommy Flitwood, Raider's Cup.
It's strange in Europe, but half a pair of shoes can't make four and no mistakes.
3Moliwood was the only pair of shoes that didn't shoot any bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided Boggy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, afternoon afternoon, and Friday morning.
It seemed as if they were moving to and from the crowd and their energy were moving away, and they had no more potential popular players with the sun disappearing in Legoff Nashnan, as if they were flying or mallini, and there were no other potential popular players.
It's better if both of them go to different holes at the same time.
Although the European pride goes from time to time.
While joining Alex Noren, Bubba Watson and Web Simpson have had some problems with Fowle Naok Serzio Garcia in the morning.
In the first nine, a bogey and two double Spaniards and Swedishs were thrown into a hole where they were never able to get up.
Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
The mutual lies between the two are very interesting to see from the forebl and Forsam near what they suggest not to suggest, and the strategy that can change radically.
Europe has been playing a good team until so far and has taken a significant lead on the Final Day, but the forum session has further evidence that the team is angry with the team for the fight, especially the statside.
Europe took 1-3 lead on the final day of the Rider's cup.
On the final day of the Rider's cup, Europe will have health benefits from the 10-way Lead against Saturday's Forebbel and Forsam match in the United States.
The encouraging shoes Tommy Flitwood and Francessco Molinari were led to victory two times against Tiger Woods, led by the Goluff National, now their Talley in four points.
Thomas Jordan's European team has been doing two years ago to recover the lost traction in Hazeltin, flying the bad American side in the morning foreblool to win the series at 20-1 a.m.
The US proposed further resistance to the U.S. won't fill the gap.
In order to recover the traffic, a group of Jim Furricks needs eight points from the 8 unit match on Sunday.
The Tana four-point receiver Flitwood was the first European Ruki and he and Molinary, together with 3 Malliwood, a wonderful weekend after receiving four points from the first four matches in the history of the Rider's Cup.
Uds and Patrick Reid were forced to go to the forefront of a losing Uds and the American Rukey Brian Decambou, and badly jailed to defeat the U.S. Ruskian Decombau.
On Saturday, two matches of Macchey picked up a light storm between the Woods pulling themselves, but now he lost 18 matches between his foreble and 30 matches in Forsam and Tana at seven.
Justin Rose, taking rest for the morning for the Forebbel, returned to Henrick Station in Forsam, partners to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepker, one and three other in the world.
In the south-west of Paris, on the windy day, though it wasn't on its own.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, set up a scale for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 2 powerful against zone Ram and Jan Poltter in Forrol, and returned to Harre Poltter and Rory McCallroy, two of the openings in Forsam.
In the history of the Rider's Cup, only two times a group has returned from the four-point collisions, although now it's only a draw to restore the trophy of Furric's side.
After two days of second peak, however, it seems to be going away from them on Sunday's reverse attack.
North Korea said that \"by no means\" would not be done independently without faith.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Saturday, told the United States that the ban on the United States is becoming more intense and that there is no chance for the country to leave their nuclear weapons alone in this national situation.
In the annual general session of the Re Young Ho World Organization said that North Korea took 15 significant good measures to stop nuclear and earthquake testing last year, to break down nuclear tests, to break down nuclear tests, and to prevent nuclear technology and nuclear weapons spread.
We didn't see any similar reactions in the United States in 2011.
If we have no confidence in the US, we will have no confidence in our national security and there will be no way to isolate ourselves from us in this national situation.
Although Washington's 4th of Washington's case against the process of nuclear deduction, North Korea described the charges that would be rewarded for slowing down in North Korea, his statement confirmed that he did not completely eliminate nuclear waste, as Pyongyang has done this in the past.
The first conference, between the US president and the leader of North Korea in R3 E June Singapore, mentioned a joint statement involving Kim Jong Won and Donald Trump, when Kim promised to work with the nuclear deductions of the Korean Peninsula and when the Trump guarantees the safety of North Korea.
North Korea is searching for the official end of the 2015-14 Korea war, but the US says Pyongyang must first leave his nuclear weapon.
Washington also refused to stop the harsh international bans on North Korea.
12 America’s 13th emphasis on non-stressionation and the increase in pressure by bans to achieve their purpose with forcedness, even against the announcement of the end of the 20 war.
The idea that innocents can push us to the ground is a silent dream of those who don't know about us.
However, the problem is that constant banning our disbelief is becoming more and more intense.
Rei Kim and Trum did not comment on the plans for the second top conference, which the United States president pointed out in the United States before the beginning of the week.
In the past five months, the minister, Kim and the South Korean leader, Mun Ja-in, spoke of three meetings: \"If the issue of reform was to be South Korea, it would not have been so uncomfortable for the Korean Peninsula.
Yet, the Sur of Rei's speech was dramatic since last year, when he told the UN General Council to target the U.S. original land of the United States with rockets in North Korea when it was 18mm: the Elve President, the Trump Kim, said suicidely 2rocket Man1.
In the United Nations, Trump warned last year to destroy North Korea as a whole, he praised Kim for his courage to take action, but said that there must still be lots of work and restrictions to be abandoned until North Korea is free.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time for it, said, \"if it takes two years, three years, or five months to do it - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the action of the UN Security Council.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompoo, told Americans that on Thursday, the Security Council, which will have to continue effectively until we are fully screened out.
The security Council has now raised restrictions on North Korea to stop funding from the nuclear and commercial launch program in Pyongong.
Pomowe met Ray at the General Assembly and then said that he would return to Piongyang to prepare the second conference for the next month.
Pompie has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He said while leaving July Pyongyang, that some progress has just been made, just hours before he was condemned for claiming to be like North Korea.
North Korea promised the meeting with Mun to be a missile site and a nuclear compiler if the U.S. approved US.
He said that Kim was looking for the 20th-century steps that he was looking for was the security guarantee of the security guarantee given in Trump Singapore and that Washington's relationship was going to be normal.
Harvard students are working hard to get enough rest.
This year, a new course cafine-fire at Harvard University is completed, and the growing culture of studying in the night of the 19th year is allowing all of his memories to be more sleepy.'
One student discovered that a number of university students in the world are often confused about how they will care for themselves.
Harvard Medical School professor and director of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Charles Sigiller, who believes that this is the first thing in the United States.
After giving a talk about the lack of sleep education, he was motivated to start the course.
'And at the end, a girl came to me and said: 'Why have I been told this for so long, my senior yards?'
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he was telling telegrams.
This is the first time in this year's life, how the school helps students to get better sleep habits in the Academy and Athletic Performance, and it explains the need to improve their general health.
Paul Bariira, director of the psychiatric professor and university health care department at Harvard Medical School, says that students decided to start the university after they had been seriously inactive for a week.
One hour long course has a related task.
In a section, there is a student room where students will learn about the effects of caffeine and light by clicking on coffee cups, screens, trainers, and books and how the Athletic Parformans is affected by sleep congestion and will appreciate the importance of a bedtime routine.
In other sections, participants are asked how long sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer
An interactive map of the campus with icon, then stimulates the participants to think about the daily routine.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as you decide to eat cigarettes, you have the right to know the effects on health, 'Professer Sigiler added.
He says that the culture of pride is still present, and he adds that sleep is a growing problem because of the rising pressure on modern technology and students.
You should be a student's 'gop' weapon' to fight against stress and anxiety, saying - and even make sleepy brains useless, hungry.
Remund So, 15-year-old, who studied chemical and physical biology in California, helped Professor Sigiller design the course, taking a class at his first grade in Harvard last year.
He said that the court opened his eyes and inspired him for a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all students will be asked to complete such a study program before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Sizzler recommended that students should consider when to go to bed and when to wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of \"low light\" made by the electric screen and LED light, which may result in the destruction of your sarcedian scandal, resulting in sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: the defeat of the Masters of the Mangar's Gollor Jarard.
Rangers saw another Away Mache defeat due to the defeat of Steven Jarard's Alomello Group at Livingston.
After the victory at St. Johnston in February 18-1, the IBRX team looked at another victory, but Gary Holt's team, as the second president of the United States, took him to eight points away from the heart of the border to the Premiship of Ledbrok.
Menga was hit seven minutes before the Half-Time but hopefully the Rangers line-up could never break them.
Rangers now move down to the sixth place, Livingston has risen to the third place, and has left the Hyberian behind the sphere in contrast with the sphere.
And more problems for Rangers are due to the fact that Linsman Calam Spence is being treated for something that is not to be overcome by the Away.
Jarard has changed eight groups which have come to the Semifa of the Betfred Cup to the top.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi1 who stole a point from Harts last week and was proud of how his organized party had captured the opponent.
Rangers may have authority over the ball, but Livingston has done more than they can.
Megan first sent Scott Pittman to Le-of-Allan McGriger for the first time, they should only score in two minutes but the Midfielder lost his great chance.
A long free-kick captain of Keghan Jacobs found Craig Hallet, but his cautious participant, Alan Lithgo, was only able to hit the ball in the back post.
Rangers' control was reiterated, but their hopes were higher than their belief in the Final Three.
Alfredo Morlos must have felt that he and Steven Lales' conflicts should have found his penalties at Quarter-Aar, but Refery Steven Thompson took down Colombia's appeal.
Rangers can only target two shots of the first, but the former Ibrox Goller, Lim Kali Lasana Kulibali's head and Ovi Azarar's shot.
Levi's 60th-minute opening goal may have been against the playground, but no one can deny that they're the hero of their design.
Resuming the Dip set of Rangers Jacobs failed again.
Scott Arfield did not react because of the dekan Galagar Scott Robinson's slotted balls, he kept his head cold to choose Menga for general financing.
Jarard took a break with Rayan Kent and was going to work with Kulibly, as Wingarty was in Morles, but the extraordinary Callie left him off the line.
However, Livingston began playing exactly the kind of game that the audience enjoyed, Lithgo and Haltt were sending long arms.
The Holt's team could still take their lead at the end of the day, but McGregor's Jacobs' attempt was to break out of the corner before he could head off the Lithgo Corner.
Thompson was again turned back to demanding Glen Middleton's substitute of Rangers who claimed to have had a kiss with Jacobs.

\"I feel very strong, at this moment - where are we forgetting humanity?\" he says.
'What have we learned when the fathers were growing up, that we are now facing this problem?'
Kitt believes that television can be partly responsible for the growth of the Tuxculini for its many male characters.
He adds: \"What are we learning together, and what do we learn?
What is taught on TV and on the streets is that children feel that they must follow this specific path to become men?
I think it's true that one of the biggest questions of this time - how do we change it?
This is certainly a great error for young people :
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not make any game of Thrones project when the next summer was new, he said he had finished his life of war and horse.
Since November, Kit Sam Shephard's trou West will play a story about a film producer and his loot brother.
The actor recently published that he considered his wife Rose as the best thing to get out of the game of Thrones.
'I became acquainted with my wife at this show, so it gave my future family a gift of life
Igret, quoted at Rose Amy Avord-Bajor Fantasi series, played on the character of John Snow's lover.
The couple were married in June 1914, in Leslie’s family, Estette, in Scotland.
HIV / AIDS: China has published about 1% increase in new events.
China has announced an increase in the number of HIV and AIDS victims.
There are more than 68,000 affected people in the country, the Health Officers said.
Only the second quarter of the 1980s has reported approximately 25,000 new cases.
Most of the new cases were caused by sexual interference from the past.
Traditionally, various parts of China quickly spread to promote HIV infection.
However, the number of HIV infected people on this road is almost zero, the Chinese Health officers said at a UN conference.
Although every year, the number of lives with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 10,000.
HIV infection through sexuality is a major problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was valid in China, but LGBT is still regarded as a protagonism against people.
Because of the country's conservative values, research has been estimated that 80-95% of men have sexual relations with men, later married women.
Many people come from unwanted sexual safety in this relationship.
Since 2006, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denied GeoP Senators' information trap, 'disgusting lies' and 'defensive theories'
U.S. Republican Maxin Waters on Saturday denied the charges that a member of his staff posted on the Wikipedia page of the private informationmakers of three Republican U.S. senators.
The Los Angeles Democracy asserts that these claims are being broadcast by the 8altra-right Wing and websites.
In a statement on Twitter, 5 minutes, lies and more hate lies.
The information is reported to include the home address and phone number of U.S. senators in the United States, including Senators, Guds at Linds in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hat, both Utter.S.
On Thursday, the information was published online by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill hearing about the charges of sexual abuse against Brett Kavana, the electorate of the Supreme Court.
After questioning the three senator Kavana, the trap came in a while.
Surveillance sites such as Gateway Scholar and RedState have reported that the IP address of the post was linked to 2waters2 offices and published information from members of the Waters staff, Hill reports.
3 This baseless charge is completely false and a perfect lie, 10 watts have disappeared.
3 members of my staff - the identity, personal information, and security that have been accused of fraud and false accusations - in no way is responsible for the arrest of the information.
This baseless accusation is completely wrong and a perfect lie.
The Waters' statement has quickly been criticized by many online online including the former Press News of the White House.
This denial was angry, wrote by Flysha.
3AT says he doesn't want to be a member of the Congress.
When no one is charged with what they have not done, they will not be angry.
They mustn't be biscuits.
They must not question the purpose of the accused.
They must be calm and clean.
The judge was comparing the democrats' reactions with criticisms about Kavana and comparing the Wyatters' reaction to Flickr, the critics felt he was very angry at hearing on Thursday.
The Republican candidate Omar Navaro, who is elected to overthrow Waters in the middle of the election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If it's true, it's big, 1 he tweets.
In his statement, Watters said his office warned 13-year-old authorities and law enforcement agencies about the false claims.
We will make sure that the criminals will be published, he has continued, and they will be legally charged for all their actions of any members of my staff and members of all members.
Johnny English Stricks Aggine Reviews - The weak Rawn Atkinson secretion
It is traditional to see Brickit in any new image with British tartar and it seems to apply to the restoration of the John English Action-Kmedy Spoof franchise - which started with John English in 2003 and returned to the English Ribron in 2011.
Clearly, how many of the trash nations of us would be able to make that self-defense chance?
In any rate, the pop-looking, rubber-moved Johnny English has the license to create new things the second time - and it's more than anything else that indicates that he's designed for a wide computer designed for the film world in other languages than English.
He must be a fool secret representative who contributed a note to the Olympics of the Shiriots of Fair theme Toon, a Dutch Dutch in Mister Bin and a Dopp London in 2012.
He was primarily based on the troller and the international mystery people Atkinson, once forgotten Barclerard TV advertising, spread dissatisfaction in science.
There is one or two minutes in this last JE outing.
I'd like to see Johnny English coming to a helicopter as soon as the bread blades are hung with a little helmet.
The gift of Atkinson for physical jokes is shown, but jokes have been very low and strangely felt, especially like the 37th and Mishn Impsible, 4Syrias, the film brand, and now make jokes with self-esteem.
The joke seems to be moving children rather than adults, and I have a strange-knocking accident of Johnny English not to be born and centred by the silence of Atkinson's naked-sinemer jokes.
The multiplely topical base is the Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker inspired Britain's secret web network, to introduce all Britain's agents in the field, to disappoint the responsible agent - a little role for Kevin Allen.
This is the last confidence of a Prime Minister who has already suffered a total loss of political opposition, the worst and affiliated personality: Ema Thompson, with his character in this half-Teresa but not too much to work on the script.
His intelligence advisors told him that every active spy has been compromised, so he has to get someone out of retirement.
And the meaning is to call Johnny English, who is now appointed as a school teacher in some of the Post institutions, but teaches beyond the record about how to be a skilled worker: there are some good jokes, as English is here at the Rock-Tip Academy School.
English came back to Whitehall for emergency briefing, and Ben Miller's former long-term sidewalk was re-confirmed.
Baw is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, the role of a juli-hkey-stick, with a bit of the abuse of Vici Peperdine.
So the Batman and Robin returned to action to make a serious mistake in Harjesti's Secret Service and again faced Ofelia Botovar.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Carishmetik is being threatened with the magic of Billionian, a blister, who claims that he can solve the problems of Britain's computer: Jack Lassey's executive criminal Jason Volta.
English and Bow began their strange high-jenking words: In the spring they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they started killing themselves by pressing on the Volttar Bisabul boat; and using the virtual reality headset of the English Volttar home to introduce themselves.
All stops must have been tapped for the last order, but it's as late as Mayam and blowing, there's a lot of children's TV on the whole.
Very moderate staff.
And I couldn't think of any other Johny English films: British film industry Rwan Atkinson can't give any role that the truth does justice to his defense?
Leber denies that it is planning to work four days a week for Briton but will pay for five days.
The Labor Party of Jeremy Corbin will consider a key plan that British will work for four days a week - but pay for five days.
According to the group report, the owners of the organization want to share an extra day-to-day savings of workers through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI).
It's going to be a three-day holiday for employees - but still will take the same salary home.
The source says that the idea is 'foot' with the group's economics and plans to move the country in favor of the workers.
Trades Union Congress has allowed for a four-day week to be transferred as an opportunity to take advantage of the changing economy of workers.
The Sun of the Sunday Times, a member of the Labor Party, said: “There is hope that a policy review will be made before the end of the year.
'It won't happen, but four days of action is a desire that fits the team's approach to the community's collective arts to maintain balance to the economy.'
Not the first to support this national idea, the Green Party promised four days' work days during their general election campaign in 1947.
The desire is not currently supported by the Lebar Party, even if.
A spokesperson of the Labor Party said: “One is not a four-day action party policy and is not considered by the group.'
John Macdenel, Shadow Chancellor, used the last week's labor conference to express his perspective on a socialist revolution in economics.
Mr. McDannell says he is determined to return power from the \"supervised Director\" and 'Lavidans' to the utility agencies.
The idea of Shadow Chancellor's plan is that the current shareholders of water organizations can not get their whole share back because the labour government may give some 'damage' because of wrong actions.
He also ensures the organization's plan to place staff on the board to provide the rights of 25 percent of workers in private sectors, who have been standing in $60.
Grandma in Linds, John Kennedy, tell us if Kavana's FBI investigation can change their minds.
The FBI investigation on charges against Brett Kavana has delayed at least a week's delay in his election in the Supreme Court, and raises questions about whether the Bureau's findings could turn a Republican Senator to support them.
In an interview on Sunday, 45 minutes, reporter Scott Pelly Republican asked Senators about 15 Kennedy and Linds whether the FBI could discover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
By 2nd, of course, 2 Kennedy said.
I told you to go to the hall, and I told you I spoke to the judge Kavana.
After this incident I called him, the complaint came out, saying, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, unexplained.
Graham's vote, of course, seems unnecessary.
My Brett Kavana has been prepared and will need a very important charge to change it, he said.
5 Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know: Brett has strongly rejected it, adding a gram by referring to 3 Christine Blasy Ford.
And they couldn't verify what he called him.
It's 500 years old.
I can't see any new changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that has a rare line-up of stars' paraphernalia and a fairly interesting mission; the world's poverty disappears.
In the seventh year, only thousands of people will see the Great Lonene of Central Park to enjoy activities such as Global Citizen Festival, Janet Jackson, Cardy B, and Sean Mendes, so this is not the case, but to increase awareness of the real goal of reducing poverty in the year 2012.
The Global Citizen Festival in 2010 is a broadcast of the global poverty project, a team that actively promotes internationally-promoting the increase in the number of people fighting poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay for the VIP tickets), many of the concertgora's work, such as volunteer work, e-mailing a worldnaire, calling a phone or helping to increase their awareness about their goals.
But how successful is it that Global Citizen has been to stay in her goal for 20 years?
Is the idea of being rewarded by a concert at any given point the real step to prompt people to take action, or is there another case of so-called 1clicktism - where people think they are signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has recorded more than 20 million from its supporters, reaching the goal.
It says that these steps have helped the world leaders to declare more than 47 billion promises and policies, which will affect the lives of 5.6 billion people within 2010.
At the beginning of 2014, the group quoted 392 promises and announcements that began with its operation, with at least $4 billion already distributed or fundraising.
The group estimates that the protected funds have still had a direct impact on nearly 40 million people around the world.
Some of the major promises are the promise of providing Rwanda to solve the problems of the County after more than 1,700 tweets from Global Citizen's more than 1,700 tweets.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national government, and Global Citizens, we can make the social injustice of abuse as a model of history, telling the public of the Power of the Power of New York in April 2014 while running a power concert in London.
The group added that after more than 2,000 steps were taken in the United States to improve the crops of mothers and children, the government declared to contribute for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which would reach about 20 million women and children in the nutrient disaster.
A frequently asked question on its website will be answered, and you think we can end up with extreme poverty.
Global Citizen responded: It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
One of those who will perform this year's event in Janet Jackson, The Week, Sean Mendes, Cardy B, Genel Monny New York, will continue to operate on Deborah-Lee Farness and Hugh Jacobman.
The U.S. can use the Navy to block Russian's fuel traffic to block 10 opposition
In the Middle East, Washington can take refuge in his boat to prevent Russian fuels from arriving, according to the description of Washington experimentation.
Zink complains that Russia's recruitment in Syria is remarkable, where it is working in an invitation to the legitimate government - an excuse to see the new fuel market.
3 I believe that their middle east is the reason they want to launch electricity like the southern center of Eastern Europe, Europe, says.
And according to officials, there are ways and media to take care of it.
He says the US has the power to keep the sea clear and to prevent the fuel from going into the market.
In the United States, a non-profit group, who introduces 3 public subscribers to the United States, was addressing participants for events organized by conziumr Energy Alliance.
He was comparing Russia and Iran to the use of Washington in real terms.
The cards placed on the 8-state fuel-based economics of Russia are mentioned in the 20th century, with the financial options of Iran and Russia, and with a replacement, he says.
The Trump administration was replaced by Russians when these statements were aimed at promoting a wide range of oiled gas exports for European customers in Europe.

Moscow bar stressed that the nine-million US dollar node stream 2 pipeline that doubles the power of the available pipeline, 110 billion cubic meters ready to be taken to a total financial project.
Kremlin's argument is that the reason for Washington's strong opposition in the project is nothing but financial and is an example of an unequal competition.
In my belief, we agree that fuel pressure cannot be used as an instrument and that the receiver should have the ability to choose, after an interview with the U.S. flame minister, Rick Peri, the minister of the Russian Department of Fire, in Moscow.
The situation in the United States has resulted in negative reactions from Germany, resurfaced by the Germanic project.
In the art, Germany's leading organization, Federation of German Industry (BDI) asked the United States to stay away from the two-dimensional agreements between the European Union's fuel policy and Berlin and Moscow.
After the recent conference between the Chancellor Angela Marcel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin, the chief director of the Federal of German Industry (BDI) said that we have a major problem in providing fuel for our third state.

Brett Kavanawagh, a member of the Supreme Court of Warren Trump and Trump, faces criticism.

US ambassadors have accused China of making 1Galagala3 (U.S.) a 12-propagand advertising campaign against China.
A week after publishing a four-page advertisement to the US daily, a public Chinese newspaper pointed out the unique advantage of the US-Chinese trade, accusing the Chinese government of using American press to campaign objectively against Beijing.
The U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned the Paed Supplement of the Chinese Day of IW last Wednesday and accused China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress election on November 6, China denied the charge.
Trump is accused of attempting to intervene in the Beijing US elections which US officials call Reuters a new attempt to pressure China.
It is normal that the foreign government will advertise commercials, but Beijing and Washington are now being sent down to the commercial war, which makes it more difficult for them to import one another.
Chinese and US experts say that the vengeanceal sullets of China at the beginning of the trade war were made to damage the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, a former long-time governor of China, says that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers, and businessmen in China.
In a post on Brensted Sunday Des Minus Register, the news article said that China, with its intended advertising in our own free press, now doubles it.
Branstad writes that the Chinese government has taken the moral advantage of American freedom of speech and free news media through the advertising of the 3Ds mines registrar.
On the 10th, you will find limited opposition voices on the streets of Beijing, and you will not see the real reflection of the difference between Chinese people's concern for Chinese's financial routes, as the news media goes to China's Communist Party.
He added that his writing refused to print a major press in 15 China, even though he did not mention the newspaper.
Before the midterm of the Qavanf debate, Republicans are trying to keep women voters away, the analysts warned.
In the face of many complaints from the Supreme Republican sexual abuses, Nimini Brett Kavanoff, a Supreme Court, stood next to Kavanoff and warned analysts that they would be able to see reactions from women especially in the upcoming Midterm election.
Feelings about the matter have been finally raised, and most Republicans have already been openly trying to move on to the vote.
In an article published on Saturday, Grant Rihar, professor of state science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, said that they can't come back at any time.
Rihar says that at the last moment of the FBI investigation, there is doubt whether the pressure of the Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona) will calm angry voters.
According to the newspaper Washington DC, the pro-democracy and national female spokesperson Karen Jean-Piere said Friday, women will not forget what happened in the past 10 years - they will not forget it tomorrow and November.
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, the protesters came on November 10th in the morning during the protest at the Cinnet's Hallway on Friday to the decision that the judge's committee had control over Kavanf's election.
Stu Rothanberg, a political analyst, told the news site that it would be the past of the 21 democratic uprisings and inspiration.
2 people say there's already too much; it's true.
However, it may be more than that, especially among the city councils and among the young voters between 18 and 29 years old who often vote for the president because they don’t like him.
Even before the analysts testified to the charges of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court's elected candidate, the Republicans also suggested that it could be a form of violence if they went on with approval.
The 5AT stands for GOP, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee said to Michael Steel NBC News, beginning last week.
Not only should the committee vote or Final Votes or Kafanf be kept behind, but it also involves how Republicans have taken the issue and used it with him.
However, the Americans felt somewhat confused about who should believe in the testimony of Fords and Qavanf, the next one.
A new survey by Yugov showed that 41 percent of respondents certainly believe in Ford's testimony, which 35 percent say they believe, probably or perhaps Qavanoff.
Also, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanoff probably lied during his witnessing, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Fleke's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges of Debora Ramirez, a Guardian report.
Ford witnesses to the judiciary committee on oath last week that Kavanoff was beaten by Nishsha at the age of 17.
Ramirez complained that the Supreme Court, Nominy, was showing her sexuality in a party in the late 1980s during the Yale studies.
Google and Facebook have planned to start a new Internet with the invention of the World Wide Web for the evening.
Tim Berners-Lee of the World Wide Web is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology is, inrept, a company that will create Berners-Lir Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid users allow them to choose where their data will be stored and which information allows people to access.
In a private interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the real purpose of the Inrap is to have the 8th world domination.
We have to do it right now, and he tells us about startup.
It's a historical moment.
The app used Solid's technology to allow everyone to create a P and D or 2-private online data store.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all the same browsers and the same.
Unlike the private online data store is that it fully relies on the user - which can access information in any form.
The company named it a private power via 2D.
According to CEO John Bruss, the idea of the Information will help bring resources, procedures, and appropriate skills to all of us.
The organization is currently a security platform purchased by Bernars-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a group of contracted on-staff developers and volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own confusing applications using the tools available in the Information website.
Berners-Lee says whether he and his team will initiate a complete change with 2 Facebook and Google where all their business models will be completely changed.
We don't ask for permission.
In a post on the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that the 8th of the Inrapt was to provide commercial fuel and a reality for maintaining the integrity and quality of the new web on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee Massachusetts Institute of Technology set up the World Wide Web Consortium and changed the Internet into a priority.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has emerged as a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
The Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will also be the founder and director of the Internet.
3 I am very optimistic about this future era of the web, 4 Bernars-Lee.

The only priest of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I, celebrated the centuries of the Adi city.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Van Prize won during the invasion of Bellinglis and Lehancott on September 29, 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a witch and never knew he had the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, one of his two dances was announced in a chuckawaze in Roshden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael van, says that it is a very significant event, that it is just 100 years after his grandmother's funeral.
According to London Gaget, on September 29, 1918, the Lieutenant Colonel van vane led his Battalion through the massive rounds of the Khusha and the Field and Machines, at the time of de Saint-Quentin Canal.
Later, he went to the firing line and led the line along with the 13-most bravery.
Lieutenant Colonel Van died on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war was over.
Michael Van, 72, says that his grandfather's works are a few things I could never do and a great respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Kuchkawaz, who was led by the Britishwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van says he is deeply respected on the part of the 12-paradise, and adds that a true hero's heroity is displayed in support of the 12 great people.
MM was awake all night to watch 206 Bellato, but instead they found Pepa Pig.
Imagine that you're awake all night to watch 206 of a great theater and that's not the main event.
The bill's main car from San Jose was six and the UK was displayed in channel 5 all night.
In the morning, when Gegard Mousssi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the Coverage caused the audience of the United Kingdom to be shocked by the change of Pepa Pige.
Especially for this fight they were awake until the morning, so some people were angry.
On Twitter, she describes the changing of cartoons by a seducer as 10 kind of dirty jokes.
According to the 12-year rule, they were forced to change the cartoons of children, according to the law of the 12-year-old Adv Schwarz, who said in response to the question about the broadcast.
32 pppa The Pig, 3 yes.
Scott Cooker, president of the University of Belato, said that he would work on making schedules in the future, thinking about the people of the United Kingdom.
We'll probably be able to solve it during the 3 Rippl, says the cooker.
We can't do this on Sunday, Sunday, and Sunday, Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe that when it's switched, there's a lot of messages and they're not very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, and we thought it might be a technological mistake.
But no, it was official.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We'll cut it down to five feet instead of six - as we usually do - the reverse is in trying to give more fans.
This is a unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Disk: Tom Daily has fallen in the middle of the 20th century due to sexuality.
Olympic Dyver Tom Deley says that while growing up, he suffered from a lack of sexuality - but it inspired him to succeed.
This 24-year-old said he didn't go to the media school until he didn't understand that 3s are not like me.
While speaking on the first radio 4 Desert Island disk, Lauren Larren, he said that he talked about gay rights to others.
He adds that after the birth of the child, the concerns of his Olympics were reduced.
A regular present for this long-term event, Christiany Young has been taking a few months of vacation because of illness.
At Lavern's first ceremony, Deley said that he felt like 10 soo more than everyone else, because it wasn’t socially acceptable for 10-year-olds to be preferred.
He says: Up to this day, the little feeling and feeling of being different has led me to the strength and strength to succeed.

And if the course itself doesn't have enough bad news, Michaelson, 9th match, British Oppen champion Francesco Molinari, who has won four matches this week.
If Americans, who have four points below the start of the 12 Singles match, can start better, Michaelson's match can prove important.
Furrick expressed confidence in him, even though he wasn't too much to say.
3 of his own bumika today, holding my arms and saying he's ready for tomorrow, Furrick says.
10 people have strong confidence in themselves.
He's one of the Fémar's and past time and he's still given much to this team this week.

I expected more, but that's what happened, and that's how we thought about going on.
He wants to get into the field, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Macche Michaelson, Nick Faldor's most radio cup match record is off.

You keep yourself thinking that we had a big lead in Valderma; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and were in good order, where we won.
History will show me and the team that it's not finished.
Let's be full of encouragement tomorrow.
Get in the field and do the right thing.
The board doesn't end up without the point.
We have a goal, that's to try and win the trophy, and that's where our bird's eyes are.

Before they arrived in the last year of 1999, Ben Krensh asked to know how he had awakened his players, and he said, \"I remember every word I have.\"

The new warship of Germany is halted again.
According to local news reports, the former German Navy's new team was supposed to start in 2014 to replace the Cold War-Jug's warship, but not until at least the next year because of poor systems and snowbling costs.
Quoting the military spokesman Die Zeit, the new Budn-Warteberg-Sharni's first ship was suspended until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to be involved in the Navy in 2014, but the high-income project has been in trouble because of the delivery problems.
In 2007 they will take the old Bremen-Clas Frigate, who ordered the four Batten-Warteberg ships.
It is known that they will remain strong in Kaman, Anti-Aircraft, and Anti-Shop projector with some stylth technology, such as Reduced Radar, Infred and Acoustic Segnecher.
Other important settings include a long-term maintenance period - it will be possible to cover new frigrates for the maximum two years away from the country’s port.
In any case, the delays are meant to mean the extreme battleships that will help Germany to show power abroad - it will become old at the time of the flood, the Dee Zeit.
Last year, the unfortunate F. 125 Freegate came in the title when the German Navy, refusing to launch an official ship, sent back to the Blooms and Voice Shipyard in Hamburg, refusing to do so.
This is the first time a ship was sent back to the Shipbuilder after the Navy's delivery.
The reason behind the return is very little, but the German media cites several important 3Software and hardware errors that would make the ship impossible in the battle.
The lights of the software are particularly important, as ships of the Batden-Warteberg-Streets will be operated by a crew of about 120 crews - half of the old Bremen's Frigates.
Also, it was seen that the ship was a relatively heavy burden that would reduce its efficiency and create obstacles to the way to add the future upgrades of the Navy.
The 7000 tonnes is thought to be twice as heavy as the Germans used the same class ship during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the entire project cost with Kruder's training has become a problem.
At 2.2 billion pounds of the original level, it is estimated that $3.6 billion (U.S.).
In the recent view of the warning of the boat-power of Germany, new fraternity reserves have become even more important.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartles, the head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the boat’s proper ship was heading for the Boatian.
The official said that the problem was solved over time, as there was no anti-capitarian ship of old ships that had been canceled.
He laments that no boat-jahajazza was able to join the Batden-Warteberg-like boat.
I've heard of being a National Trust in the Dark's Secret Life.
New research is being conducted at an Estet of the Scots Party to learn how to use food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of this unilateral winged animal and will assist in future storage activities.
The research of scientists in National Trust for Scotland will be conducted with the general and so-called Pipesells and the Dunbantons of Wester Ross's Inaverau Garden.
The entire season will be placed in important places around the special recorder area to track the elderly.
NHS workers and volunteers will also perform ongoing surveys using a supported detector.
Experts will be able to analyze all the recording sounds and draw out the voice of the bat call and what the nation is doing.
Then, a landscape map and report will be created to create a landscape image of their behavior.
The NTS nature storage counselor hopes to provide the results that some areas of the habitat will reveal the most important and most important to the elderly and how it is used by each species.
This information will help to determine the utility of home management, such as how to protect forests for grass formations and deserts and other related species.

The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historical buildings around the country, 38 important parks, and 76,000 hectares of land care, has taken priority.
There are ten trained specialists who regularly review, visit sleep space, and sometimes rescue.
The organization also set up the first and only-in-the-in-law of Dumfries and Gallo's Thrive Estate Scottland, a home of eight in the ten-fold species of Scotland.
David Thompson, the Institute Manager, says that this is the standard area for the elderly.
There's a good area for the ducks in Thrive here, he says.
There's an old building here, there's a lot of ancient trees, and there's all good homes.
But much more is unknown about the bumble, so it will help us to understand more about what we need to do here and in other places to save them.
He emphasizes the importance of knowing the appearance of the frogs before guarding the property, as it may result in the destruction of an unpredictably mother's residence, destruction of 400 female and baby adults, and a total of the local elderly.
It is illegal to kill Buddhists and their victims, rape or torture or destroy their homes.

Ronaldo denies rape and lawyers continue to file a case against the German newspaper
The charges of rape against him are reported to be 7th news that people want to raise their own 3D identity with his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a case against the German News Magazine der Spigel, who brought the complaint out.
In 2009, against the Portuguese and Juventas Foreard, Kathryn Mazo3rga, in a hotel in Las Vegas, was accused of rape.
He was accused that he had been given $375,000 to keep silent about the incident, which was posted on Friday by Der Spigel.
A few hours after the demand came to the public, Ronaldo, a 33-year-old, commented on his 142 million awards in his Instagram Live video.
No, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news, 5 times Balon-Do's winner camera.
3 They want to increase their contact by using my name.
It's normal.
My name says they want to be famous for themselves, but it's part of the livelihood.
I'm a happy man and everything's going on, and the player laughs.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a complaint against Der Spiegel, which they call to be unconstitutional reports regarding the 3 Gopani.
Lawyer Christian Sheritz says that the player is responsible for the moral damage that is probably one of the most serious violations of private rights in recent times.
The story is mentioned as a suit of Palms Hotel and Casino in June 2009 in Las Vegas.
According to a paper issued in Nevada's Clark County District Court, it is said that after meeting a night class, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the house of the player, where he physically raped him.
Myorga claimed that Ronaldo bowed down after the incident and told him that 499 percent of the people he had been disappointed for 45%.
The document claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sexual relations, but it was a consensus.
Myorga also claimed that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries to the hospital, but later agreed to settle outside the court because she was afraid of the 25-year-olds and was afraid of being humiliated.
The 34-year-old youth said that he is now trying to reform the ruling because he has been mentally damaged by the events that happened.
During the same crime, Ronaldo Manchester was on the scene to join Real Madride from United, and joined in the famous Italian club juvenile of $100 million in the summer.
You're missing the location as a car manufacturer.
The Minister of Trade says Greg Clark, the United Kingdom will be the first in the world to build a car after Braxit.
He adds that it is a 12-dominated, that the United Kingdom told BBC that if Britain is released without any agreement, they would stop their factory at Bernstein in Bernbir.
We need a deal, says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer reported that if Brickit was free of contracts, people could leave their jobs because of the border delay.
Bernston's factory, built by Toyota Oris and Avenis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, with approximately 90 percent of the European Union's remaining countries.
Martin Cook, director of the Toutor Management Director at Bernstein, said, my opinion is that if Britain came out of Eu at the end of March, the production of our plant could be stopped.
With Honda, B.M.W., and other UK car manufacturers with Land Rover, have expressed concern about how international trade would be managed without a deal.
For example, BMW said they would close their mini plant in Oxford within a month after the bricket.
The main concern that car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chaining for free contracts.
Toutor production lines are based on 2Just-in-time, both UK and EU have access to the suppliers every 37 minutes.
If it leaves the U without a contract on March 29, it can interfere with the boundaries that allow for delay in the supply of energy and can lead to the crisis of the energy.
The organization said that the Toutor's Darbishhair plant cannot contain more than a day's investment, causing the production to cease.
Mr. Clark said that in the future, Thoresa May's checkers' plan for a relationship with the U has been well designed to prevent this type of check.
We need a deal, and we want to do the best deal not only to be successful but also to enjoy the potential for future improvement, at BBC Radio 4 today.
Not a 2cable toy, but also to other producers, it is very important to continue the success of the supplier's chain.
Toyota is unable to say how long the production will be stopped, but they warn that long-term spending will reduce the efficiency of factory performance and that many jobs can go away.
In Bernstein, who has been working for 24 years and the United Nations High Commissioner of the Plant, Peter Suvallis said that his members are increasingly concerned about: - They don’t come back once they have done it in my experience.
A official spokesperson says: We have to have a definite and reliable plan to deal with the future.

In Washington, for the past few months, there has been controversy about whether the Trump deputy Attorney General will be released and whether Mueller's freedom will be in the face of questions.
Early this month, Rogestein discussed the possibility of removing the president through the use of a secret Mike to record a conversation with the New York Times Trum and the 25th amendments.
Rosestein denied the report.
However, he continues to resign, saying he went to the White House last Monday in front of the report.
Instead, the meeting was announced on Thursday, the Trump was at the UN headquarters in New York.

Some journalists will protest the statement, not in the White House after 10 September.
The driver, Chris Wallace, asked for his reason.
Sanders said that the reasons for not keeping the briofing were to show the journalists a lot of concern, not for the inconvenience, though he said: \"I don't deny that they have done what they showed.\"
He then suggested that he develop direct communication between the tramp and the press.
The 13th president has sessioned more than any of his previous presidents, without any evidence: 4 we have judged the number.
Briefing will also happen in the future, Sanders says that it is better to speak to me if the US president has the opportunity to direct questions.
We tried to do this, and for the past few weeks, you have seen us do it, and you're going to find a place to speak to the U.S. President in place of the press briefing.
Trump frequently asks questions while leaving the White House or participating in opening sessions or with prominent guests in the press conference.
A single journalist conference is very low.
This week in New York, it is likely that the President will show why, in an unpredictable way, and sometimes in front of the journalist group.

Internet dissected compared with mother and cow in the advertising industry
A new pump company divided the Internet's opinion with an advertisement to compare children's mothers with milking cows.
The first word pump in the 19th world, which is said to have been released by the consumer technology agency LV, has published a fascinating music video type advertising to show the release of the new pump to modern mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing with a song of a cat full of pride, including the Lyric: - Yes, I pray myself, but I don't have a leg. And if you can see, they're not a animal's nest, they're my turn.
Corus continues: 12 pumps, pumps, wraps, I feed, pumps, I give my friends milk.
However, the advertisement, which has been released on the company's Facebook page, has created an online debate.
The video has been mixed with viewers in 77,000 views and shares in the Shaw Commission, many say it sheds light on the 13th anniversary of the milk industry.
It's a bad idea to use cattle in the commercials of this product.
Like us to make milk, they need to be pregnant and have children, the difference is that within a few days of birth, their children were stolen from them, one wrote.
The LV pump is well placed inside any nursing Bra (LV / Mom)
Another commented: \"It's innocent for both mothers and children.\"
But they will not be used in the breakfast pumps for those who put the child in the comfort zone.
Another said: \"Authorous advertising.\"
Others stood by the advertisements, a woman admitted that the song was about 30 minutes long.
I think it's a wonderful idea.
If I had fed the kid, I would have taken one.
I think I'm a cow when I jump.
It's kind of crazy, but I've taken it well.
It's an innovative product, one wrote.
Another comment: It's a funny advertisement that he's looking for mothers who are pumping their jobs or toilets.
This advertising doesn't praise or criticize the Daily Arts.
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they were all dancing with the hidden pump in bra.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel as helpless as they are in the process.
Although the LV pump is totally non-wordless, it doesn't have a tube, and it has a beautiful fit in the nursing brow, which also gives women the freedom to bend, hold the baby, and even go out.
Anna Balerin, Partner of Mother's and ECD said: \"The LV pump is a revolutionary product that should start bravely and excitingly.
By drawing a parallel picture of women and milky Gavy, we have been trying to highlight the evolution pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, revealing the new platform that will make a feel of release in an interesting and related way.
The LV pump didn't take place for the first time.
In the London fashion week, the mother of one of the two children used this product to walk Katwa for the designer's Marta Zacuboosski.
Some of the immigrant children were taken to a tents near the Texus border.
The number of detainees has increased, although the monthly border crossing has been relatively constant, as it has made it even more difficult for children to maintain strict rules and principles to their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are concerned with losing their own chances of living in this country by claiming migrants and children without their own papers.
The risk increased on June, when federal authorities announce that potential sponsors and other senior members of their family have to submit fingerprints, and the information will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, an ex-military activist from immigration and slump testified in front of Matthew Albanes Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who urged to sponsor orphanage children.
The agency later stated that those graduate people have no past 70 percent of the crime history.
Nearly 80 percent of members of the family of 2 sponsors are illegal and a large portion of them are criminal criminals.
So we're going to keep looking for them, says Nester Albanes.
In an attempt to bring children back to society more quickly, officials set up a new rule, including in a month of detention, which was already 60 days ago, refugees reported.
Many will come through video conference calls not personally on their case for legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unworthy of relief will be thrown off quickly.
According to asylum workers and reports from the system in recent months, children are likely to experience more anxiety or frustration as a result of an attempt to escape or escape violence.
Supportors say these concerns are more intense in the big centres like Toronto, where children are more concerned with the possibility of being ignored because of their size.
They also say that if they are not to prepare children mentally or have enough time to leave friends in the center, they may increase the trom a few times so that they are already suffering.
The U.S., French, and Turkish 'South Army' have been asked to move immediately.
In addressing the UN general council, Foreign Minister Walid-Al-Maulem calls for the return of Syrian refugees, even though Tana has been in the country for eight years.
Moylem, who is also the vice-president of the country, said foreign forces are illegally on the ground in order to fight terrorism, and we will take 3 proper measures.
He said to the council:
Moalem insists that the war is almost over in Syria, where more than 3600,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight until it clears the entire Syrian landscape.
In Syria, there are about 2,000 military members, the Kurds against President Bashar-Al-Assad and both Syrian Arabia are primarily trained and permitted.
There are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the war - the country.
In question of refugees, Morealem says that the situation is useful for their return and he blames more than 60,000 western countries for spreading the horrors that prompted the refugees to stay away.
We invite international communities and human organizations to help this return, he says.
They're politics regarding the 20 most complete human problems.
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition ends the war.
U.S. diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey has been able to continue with political discussions in Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major anti-terrorist base.
The Russian-Tursk deal has resisted a major attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the area where three million people live.
However, Morelem insisted that the deal has 2 consecutive intervals, and he hoped that the military action would work against Al-Qaeda-United Nussera Front's warriors, who would be set free.
President Staffan de Mistura of the United Nations hopes to be the first meeting of a new committee formed by the government and members of the opposition team to draft the war-front constitution.
Mowalem points out the Syrian government's involvement in this committee, stating that the panel's work should be restricted to 10 articles of the government to review, and warned against unpredictable interventions.

In the middle of the election, the outside money is flooded.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th vote is flying, as two candidates are fighting for one seat on the redistribution of the Congressional District.
Recently re-rehabilitated urban Pittsburgh District Pits led the Democratic representative to fight Connor Lamb - who won another district in a special election last spring.
The Lamb is fighting against Republican Keith Rothfas, currently representing the 12th District of Pennsylvania, most of which is part of the New 17th District.
In January, Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally formated in favor of Republicans, resulting in the recombination of the map.
The New 17th District’s president’s campaign of election has played a key role in promoting funds between the branch Democratic Camp Congress (DCC) and the National Republican Camp Committee (NRCC).
The 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, in March, has been contacted by the Lamb after winning only a distance of time.
The seat has been on the Republicans' rights for over a decade and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political parties are taking the democrats a little further.
U.S. China is a major drug for El Salvador, later abandoned.
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, a little behind Washington.
Mr. Trump Panama's president, Juan Carlos Varella, met a summer meeting in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama, but the partners later removed the director of the Trump Organization.
In a statement leading to the beginning of the month of the foreign department, Hidar Noort said that the recent decision to not further recognize Taywan, the officers of the court decided to return to the American head of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
However, only El Salvador was sentenced to $140 million in 2017 for taking control of the drug, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed punishment, including financial support cover and specific visa restrictions, could be tragic for the country in Central America due to its high unemployment and death rate.
Along with the progress of the internal meeting, North America and Central America officials held a high-ranking conference to prevent immigrants from tearing the U.S. for the past year as a move to protect and promote economic growth.
But in mid-September, Nagad, officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted to attend the conference, which effectively ended the possibility of El Salvador's execution.
Cottons reported that Vice-Pressident Mike Pence would give a speech at the conference, which was scheduled in mid-October so that the administration could deliver the message of import.
And the U.S. angels of three countries will be silenced by the return of El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without getting any bitter messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton was not willing to make any comment about what the American official had said about the two critics who agreed to discuss the internal matter under the terms of not publishing a mask in the White House.
Their speech is confirmed by an external analyst near the administration, and he also refuses to reveal his name.

The next impossible case may be Robert Muller's special report on the possible constraints of Mr. Trump, which now has enough evidence in the public record.
If Mr. Trump had no contact with Russia at the time of the election, it was reported that Mr. Muller's investigation was turning towards.
If Congress has changed his hands, Mr. Trump has to take responsibility for him, just as he is preparing to go back in front of the voters and may eventually be in front of jury with his colleagues.

Micronesia's plane crash: Air Newgini said that a missing plane accident was missing
When an airline plane broke down in Pasific Legune, Micronesia, they said that 47 passengers and workers were rescued from drowning planes, and now they know they were missing.
A report by Air Newgini on Saturday Bickel says a man cannot be found.
The airport reported that they were working with local administrations, hospitals, and investigators to find him.
Airline immediately refused to report details like Boys and Nationality.
When the plane crashed into the water, some local boats helped rescue passengers and workers.
The officials reported Friday, seven were taken to the hospital.
The Airline reported that six passengers were also in hospital on Saturdays, and they were all standing.
There is still nothing clear about what caused the accident.
Both Airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane was flooded before it reached the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was out of the runway.
The U.S. passenger Bill Jens said that the plane went down too low.
That's a good thing, says 2 Jans.
Jens said he and others would get to the door of the sinking plane by water.

U.S. judiciary analyst Paul Raolet witnessed for hours as an expert on intelligence analysis.

Raolet says he retrieves several cellphones that show that the teles and Chambers were together on the evening of the death, against the previous tenure of Teles, the Clearion laser report.
The information is that his cellphone was in touch with Chambers at the time, although he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town at night.
When the kunsulira asks if Teles is telling the truth if he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he had been in Nashville that day.

Another Krishna?
New York Nayny has filed a case against a couple who have been charged with a job violation after a ten-year-old trial.
A New York-based couple is filed against a New York-related couple to get a dissatisfaction test from a mother who is called a 12-recommunisher.
The couple refused to be a ethnicist and asked for a case on charges of 3zulum 2.
Two children's mother, Linsy Plasco-Felxman, expressed frustration after the first day of work in 2016, found out that Gijel Morris was a farmer of a child's new staff.
3Naaaaa another Krishna, Mrs. Plasco-Felxman writes his husband to test me.
However, instead of sending her husband to Miss Morris, he sent her twice.
Later, to understand his mistake, Plasco-Felxmann expelled Miss Morris, who said he hoped to report a Filipino post to his former grandmother who was an African-American.
Miss Morris was given to mines one day and then Ubar Day was sent home.
Maurice is now making compensation for the expulsion of a couple and wants to pay up as $350 a day for six months, even though he was first hired as a housekeeper without a contract.
3 I want to show them, see, they can't, he tells the post on Friday, and joins the Joint Committee, I know it's unfair.
The couple protested against their claims that the removal of Maurice was reasonable in fear that he could not believe it after he was accused of it.
He didn't want to say what my wife had sent.
He's not racist.
We're not a ethnicist couple, and our husband, Joel Plasco, told the post.
3 But would you leave your children in someone you have treated badly, even though it was wrong to do so?
Children in Your Youth?
Tell me.
Plasco says about the charges of July 3, his wife was only born two months ago and was in ‘the toughest situation.’

About Paddington, whom he describes as the 13 most important member of our family, says his father was very proud of his final success.
He was a silent man, and he was not a giant, he said.
The Paddington was so real to him that your own child achieved any success: you're proud of him, even though you don't have one.
I think that's how he looks at Paddington's success.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he was always grateful to Paddington.
My daughter was dead and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
Soon after the landing, her daughter was taken to the Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur, where doctors tried to save her life.
The NAD called regularly and said it was bad, and he wouldn't survive, says 5 Mrs. Eden-Lapperoz.
And then I found Nad's phone and I knew he would die in two minutes and I was forced to call him off.

I say, 3ashi, I love you very much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.

That he needs my love and compassion.
I know how good he was.
This woman posted cards to stop suicide on the bridge.
Two women, who have lost their loved ones in suicide, work to stop suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfres posted cards with inspirational messages to the Welsh Bridge and put phone numbers where people can call for convenience.
Mr. Davis's son, Tyler, has died at the age of 13 and suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parents to feel what I'm pretending to do, he says.
Miss Davis, 45-year-old, who lives in Lidney, said that his son was a promise-in-law Shef and had a calmer smile.
He knew him for a smile.
Everyone would say that his house was shining in his smile.
However, before he died, he left his job because he really went to the dark.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, aged 11, found him dead.
Miz Davis says: \"I continue to worry that this effort will end up poisoning.\"
Ms. Davis has made cards, informing 6s Subby about the people you can talk to, he may be a friend.
Don't sit down - you need to talk.
Mrs. Hamfres, a friend of Miss Davis for years, lost his 15-year-old friend Mark after his mother died.

I noticed changes in his use two days ago.
She had a very bad situation on the day of Christus - when the children opened their gifts, she didn't even look at them.

B.B.I. investigation begins with a future question by Brett Kavanf.
I thought that if we could give him anything he wanted - as limited, opportunities are limited - we could probably bring some unity, says Mr. Fleck Saturday, he's expecting, maybe the committee may be reading in 4veng, in view of this unfair ignorance.
What did Mr. Kavanoff and his Republican supporters not want FBI investigations?
Their obligation is related to time.
On November 6, the middle election, only five weeks left - if, as expected, the Republicans produce bad results, then their efforts will become very weak to find those who prefer the highest court in the country.
George W calls the Bush senators and asks them to support Mr. Kavanf, who is working in the White House under Mr. Bush, by means of Mr. Bush, who was personally accessible to Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI reports?
There will be a vote on the Senate, where there are 51 Republicans and 49 democrats currently.
It's not clear whether Mr. Kavanoff can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will break the Vis-Pressident Mike Pence tie and make him sure he's in the Supreme Court.
The number of teams in North Korea is under Kim.
After Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korea's factions was diminished, a South Korean law promulgated.
Park Biong-Seg, quoted the Ministry of Assembly in South Korea, saying that last year there were 1,127 - which was 2,706.
Mr. Park says that the main reason for the hard border control between North Korea and China and the cost of human traffickers.
Piyy-Yong didn't make any public comment on this.
A vast number of teams from North Korea are being given the citizenship of South Korea.
Soul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most have fled to China, which has a long border with North Korea and is much easier than to cross a highly protected uncomplicated zone (DMJ) between two Koreans.
China considers these refugees not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants, and often forced them to return to their homeland.
The relationship between North and South Korea - who are still in war - has been significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the seven months, two people's leaders have attended a discussion in Pyongyunge, the central center of the nuclear silence in Tom.
It was after a historical meeting between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they were strongly integrated into working to create a nuclear weapon free Korean novel.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blames the US ban on progress.
In a speech given to the United Nations General Council in New York, Mr. R.
Nancy Pelossi Bret Kavanf says he is unable to take responsibility in the Supreme Court.
The House's majority leader, Nancy Pelossi, called the Supreme Court Nominy Brett Kavanof, and said he was quite unfit to take responsibility in the Supreme Court.
Pelossi, on Saturday, Austin, commented in an interview at Texas Tribune Festival.
On Thursday, the Senate said about his reaction to Kavanf's testimony in front of the Judiciary Committee, I didn't think that if a woman had ever done such a thing, she would have been called 3histria-grand.
Kavanf denied the accusation with Jor, saying that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blazezi while they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanf was sentimental, worried about his family and high school life, and his breath was going to be shut.
He clearly condemned the democrats in the Committee and the charges against him were a 12-wound and armed character organized by the Liberals, claiming that it is from the wrath of Hari in the 2016 presidential election of Hillary Clinton.
Pelosy says he believes Kavanf's testimony proves that he is not qualified for Supreme Court, as it has proved that he is biased against the democrats.
3 I think he has proved himself unworthy of the statement he made and the way he opposed Clinton and the Democratics, he says.
When asked whether Kavanoff would criticize him when he was confirmed and the Democrats got the majority in the House, Pelossi expressed frustration.
3 I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell Congress or FBI, he's not only qualified for the Supreme Court, but also the court that he's now in, says 2 pelosi.
Kavanoff is currently the judge of the Secret Court of Apples in D.C.
Pelossi adds that as a democrat, he is worried that Kavanoff Affordable Care Act or Ro V. Wade would protest because he himself is a conservative Justice.
To hear his confirmation, Kavanf has avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
It's not allowed to be that histria-gressed, hostile, tell us, \"It's not great, says 1 pelosi.\"
And women should control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger, and he can't bear it.
We cried when we were angry, and I was told about 45 years after Ms. Steiny.
I don't think it's rare, what you say.
He adds that a woman executive in 2011 helped a lot, saying that he even wept when he was angry, but he chose to say to the person who spoke to him, \"I feel sorry for you, because I'm crying.\"
I'm really angry.
Then he continued.
I thought it was amazing.
Ashru works partly as an outlet of anger because they are basically victims of misunderstandings.
A sharp memory of my first job, a man-in-the-chief office, where I once saw myself crying in an incredible rage, an old woman held my skirt - who was a giant manager I always feared - who took me to the stairs.
Don't let 2 people see that you're crying, he told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy to see them.
Patrick Schroeder, the Democratic Congressoman of Colorado, worked with him during the presidential election of Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart caught up in a boat in Manky Business abroad and left out of competition for dirty work, he was deeply disappointed that he had no reason to be a president of his own country.
It wasn't a very well-planned decision, he said to smile 30 years later.
There are seven other candidates in the fight, and no one else wants another candidate.
One told it.
As he was late in the campaign, he was behind the collection of funds and so he vowed he wouldn't leave the race without collecting $2 million.
It was the battle of Hari.
He saw that a supporter was given $10,000 to a man and only $250 was given.
3 of them think I'll get the price, he's surprised.
When he announced that he would not run official propaganda, he was deeply impressed with emotion and his supporters, making money hard to collect, which he targeted voters instead of representatives, and became ill with anger about gender inequality.
You might have thought that I had a nerve problem, recalling the news media's physics, Ms. Schrooder said.
You might have thought that Clinx was my corporate sponsor.
I remember, I thought, where would they bury me?
330 crying.
How could the US-Chinese trade war go to Beijing?
The first stage of the US-Chinese trade war was coal, and when the war ends, Beijing can be useful in the conflict between the two countries, like experts.
The U.S. President Donald Trump, early this year, was the first to warn the main Chinese export products, including the Solar Panel, Esp and Aluminium.
The most remarkable answer is this week, when about half of the total imports from China, about $200 billion (50 billion pounds), new shoots are built.
Beijing has been reimburseed every time - they have recently raised five to ten percent sulks over the US yield of $60 billion.
China has decided to fight with eyes, and the second largest economy in the world has no chance to lose sight of it soon.
The demand for Washington's retreat, however, will be quite humiliating for China's president Xi Jinping, publicly lowering his head to the US.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play cards correctly, the pressure of US trade can help China to reduce the interdependency between two economics and a long time.
The situation of both countries is much worse than the idea of Wakibhal Mahal, the Center for New American Security, says Dr. Abiegel Grace, a researcher who cares about Asia.
Syria's \"presumptuous\" to return her refugees, the Foreign Minister says.
Syria says that the country is ready to return to the relief of refugees, and the seven-year-old war-breaking country has been urged to rebuild.
In the United States, when it is spoken at the General Council, Foreign Minister Waled Al-Maulem says that the country is improving.
The situation is stable and safe today because of the progress in fighting against terrorists, he says.
The government has continued to restore the natural situation in areas that were destroyed by terrorists.
The situation is now favorable for the people who are forced to leave the country for their daily lives and livelihood due to terrorism and civil economic conditions.
The UN estimates that over 55 million have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The rest of 6 million people from the country need human help.
Al-Morwalem says that the Syrian government welcomes all the help in the restoration of the country.
However, he also insists that no contractual assistance will be taken, nor will the aid of rebels be taken.
Victory of the Rider's Cup in Paris
Tim, out of Paris, Europe, won the Rider's Cup in the Gulf Navy 16.5-10.5 final score in the Gulf Navy.

I don't usually cry, but I can't.
It's been a bad year.
Thanks to Thomas for choosing me to believe in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's the success of the group, I'm happy I'm able to help, abegical in the European win, says Garcia.
He took responsibility for John Ramam in his country, who lost the US Legend Golf Tiger Woods on Sunday Singles 2 and 1.
I'm very proud of losing 22 Tiger Woods, grew up seeing him, says 23-year-old John Ram.
Woods has lost four of his matches in France, and the Rider's cup has been recording 13-21-3.
This is an inhuman record for the greatest player of all time, who won 14 major figures after only the top-high Jack Nicholas.
Team U.S. has been hacked all week except for high-ranking Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau.
The US captain, Jim Furrick, after the disappointing conference of his team, said, I am proud of them, and they have fought.
Today morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We didn't.
Congratulations on Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All of his 12 players are very well played.
We'll turn around, I'll work with the U.S. PG. and Rider's Cup Committee and move on.
I love this 12 and are proud to be their leader.
You have to respect them.
We didn't get into the game.
