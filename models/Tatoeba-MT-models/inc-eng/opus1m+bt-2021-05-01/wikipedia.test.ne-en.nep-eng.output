The definition of mutations is given in many ways, but the conclusion of all is that it is a kind of genetic change.
The mutation has been defined as the name of a dynamic chemical change in the genetic material of some species.
One of the methods for mutations is available to scientists today, which they are being used to detect.
Evolution is called a sudden or sudden genetic change.
