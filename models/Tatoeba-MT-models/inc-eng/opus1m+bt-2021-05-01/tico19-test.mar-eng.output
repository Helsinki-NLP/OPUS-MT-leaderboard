How long have these symptoms appeared?
And all the pain in the chest should be treated this way, especially for our age
And while it's hot
And you also need to check your cholesterol, blood pressure
And do you have fever now?
And are you losing your chest now?
And also if you are having difficulty breathing
And can you tell me what other symptoms you are experiencing along with?
And how much your fever was rising
And I'm also missing
And I have a little cold and hollow
And my chest is really hurting me today
And is this the right time for your pollen
And it causes pain in the chest
And I think I'm getting a little hot
And I want to hear from you the description of where there is pain in the chest
And they also have a little heat
And with your history of diabetes
And it feels like my chest will be crushed
And people are missing the whole time before me
And you have chest pains
And you said it is the pressure in your chest
Does anyone in the family have a heart problem, heart disease, heart rate, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
What other symptoms or problems have you found with nerve pain?
Are there any other sick people who have the same symptoms in your home?
What other symptoms are you experiencing?
Do you have a shock?
Do you still suffer from chest pains?
Because it's the flu's season
However, we must not ignore the suffering of the heart
However, the pain of the chest is now a more important problem
However, I'm having trouble breathing
I know, however, that many people have fallen upon me.
However, we must take seriously the pain each breast carries
However, is your respiratory activity okay?
The pain of the chest made me completely forget
Does someone seem to press your chest
Do you feel that you are still doomed to destruction?
Have they complained about being ill because of the same symptoms?
Do you have other rare diseases or similar problems like high blood pressure?
Do you have any other ailments like diabetes?
Do you suffer from the pain of the chest?
Do you have high blood pressure?
Do you have to deal with it?
Do you know what symptoms she has?
Do you see this image?
Drink plenty of liquid today
Even so, I have tested diabetes
However, she is feeling the same symptoms as me
How much heat do you have?
How much is your blood pressure?
If you are constantly getting too hot
If you have one hundred two or more fevers
If you think you need to look carefully at your symptoms or problems
I got fever yesterday
I also have a little heat
I had fever yesterday
I'm feeling very bad here in the roof
I am also suffering from breathing
I'll send you an image
I am suffering from chest pains today
I feel headaches and a little fever today
According to my opinion, flu is
According to my opinion, it is a little flu
Does someone seem to be sitting too heavy on your chest?
It started at the same time with headaches and fever
So my chest is hurting in the middle of
The pressure is like the pain in the chest
It is in my chest
It is in the middle of my chest
It is in the middle of the chest
My chest pains.
I'm very worried about the pain of this chest
You should describe in detail the chest pain
For example, high blood pressure or diabetes
For example, in the middle of the chest
Now you can take the tachipirina swit for heat
Now, how long did Mary feel for you
Now you said you were suffering in the chest
Sometimes I suffer from chest pains
OK Besides suffering, what other symptoms you are experiencing are
Or who is sitting on your chest?
The same is about fever and skull, headaches and nerve pain
Just in the middle of my chest
Show me this image where you're hurt
You are being hot
If so, you may feel that some of these symptoms may be related to pregnancy.
If so, your children are likely to experience similar symptoms.
Tell me about your chest pain
Heat Increases Night
From the last two days, I had a fever
Heat yesterday began to grow from night
I am a doctor porter from the Emergency Room Triage Center
Can you tell me more about your chest pain?
I'm hurt here in the front part of my chest
All right, but my chest is too much hurt
When I suffer in my chest
What type of pain do you have in your chest?
When did the chest pains begin?
Where is your chest pain?
You feel the pain in your chest
You may feel tight in the chest
You know I have diabetes and other problems
You said you were hurt in your chest
European Union/European economic sector and combined events of coronary disease (COVID-19) in the United Kingdom, are rapidly increasing between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
The combined events of coronary disease (COVID-19) cases are showing similar forms in the European Union/European economic sector in the country and the United Kingdom, confirming that although stages vary according to country, COVID-19 epidemics are rapidly increasing in the country.
Depending on Italy's experience, countries, conservatives, and thorough medical centers should increase their preparation for the rapid increase in number of patients with COVID-19, who will need health care and particularly extreme-distance treatment.
On December 31, 2019, the owner of the pneumonia proceedings of unknown occupations was found in Wuhan, the province of Hubei, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China's disease control and prevention center issued a new coronary heart attack as a healing medium, now called severe serious respiratory disease coronary heart disease 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Because of the disease SARS-CoV-2 infection, he was called coronary disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far has come to the observation that 80% of those with COVID-19 have mild illnesses, i.e. with pneumonia or without it, and most of them have been cured.
In 14% cases, COVID-19 forms a more serious illness that needs to be introduced to the roganese if the rest of 6% of the cases are serious for which a thorough therapy is needed.
Due to COVID-19, the rugs loaded into the Rugget have a death rate of 4%.
In these studies, we evaluated the forms of COVID-19 combined events in each country and the United Kingdom (UK) of the European Union/European economic sector (EU/EEA) and compared them with the Hubei province of China.
We also compared the number of cases of EU/EEEA countries and the COVID-19s in UK with cases in Italy between January 31, March 15, 2020.
Proceedings of the EU/EEA Country and COVID-19 in UK
After China, the COVID-19 was further geographical spread and the closeness of the COVID-19 epidemic in the rest of the world is now following the state of the country.
On 11 March 2020, major organizers of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 epidemic.
The UeroSehlens 2020, published in the March 5th of Spiteri et al, reported the first case of COVID-19 in Europe, according to WHO's definition.
In EU/EEA, France issued a notice of the first three definite cases returned from Wuhan in the province of Ubei, China on January 24, 2020.
By March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EEEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) found the case of COVID-19, including 31 December 2019 and that date with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, with 1770 cases in single Italy and 1,41 deaths.
Getting combined numbers of COVID-19 cases and combined events
The European Center of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) records the COVID-19 cases of each country around the world, for which the health ministers of countries, national and regional health authorities, and the official sources such as WHO, are updated every morning at 8:00 p.m.
This data is used to evaluate the form of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK and compare them with cases in Italy.
As a model for the scope of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the combined events of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, for this period of 1 January - 15 March 2020, considering the natural spread of every EU/EEA country and the COVID-19 in UK.
We also presented the combined number of indicated cases in each country at 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, and compared them to the cases of Italy in the period of January 31-15 March 2020.
Formation of EU/EEA Country and COVID-19 in UK
EU/EEA country and the united form of the 14-days divided by COVID-19's 14-days in the UK are similar to the Hobei province (China)
In all, in the EU/EEA and UK, the combined events of COVID-19 began to rise near February 21, and then began to grow rapidly by 28 February 2020 (full content).
It consisted mainly of rapid growth indications of cases in Italy, however, all other EU/EEA countries and UK showed an increasing form of combined events of COVID-19 (full content).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases in Italy compared to the cases in Italy between 31 January-15 March 2020.
It highlights that the number of cases in Italy was already recorded at 15 other EU/EEA countries and UK at 8 p.m. or less at 8 p.m.
Our extraction shows that the cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK are rapidly increasing.
The form observed in the combined events of COVID-19 indicates that the epidemic is increasing relatively rapidly in all countries.
While various countries are at different stages, the possible interpretation of distance between national public health responses and the selection of different cases between countries and the different protocols of Ruggans must be examined for confirmation of COVID-19, including a catch-up test.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in affected parts of Italy described a condition in which COVID-19 requires overduced therapy for the affected 10% rugs and media sources indicate that the regulatory and extreme medical centers in these areas have already reached their maximum potential.
Data to load COVID-19 in the Rugment and/or overduced Medicine Center is currently available only for 6% and 1% of cases (not shown).
However, they need to compile the current maintenance data in a systemwide way that will focus on the number of indicated cases and the number of deaths.
A study done in 2010-11 showed that overdrinking in Europe is too much in the number of medical and moderate medical beds, which is 29.2 bed in Germany for a 100,000 population, while in Portugal 4.2.
This means that less or more resources than Italy are to other countries (approximately 12.5 overcrowding therapy and moderate medical bed per 100,000 people in 2010-11).
The trend of COVID-19 cases introduced in each EU/EEA country and in the UK is the model situation relating to the completion of health care capacity is associated with a deep medical bed loss > 90% risk of passing capacity, provided in the sixth update of COVID-19's ECDC rapid risk assessment.
Since the process is still limited to certain regions of the EU/EEA and some of the UK's countries and as conservative and thorough medical centers provide treatment to a specific area population, information about the information and extreme medical centers of cases should be available in the definition of regional centers for level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current form of other countries shows that the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly spreading in EU/EEEA and UK.
Therefore, countries, conservatives and extreme medical centers need to prepare themselves for the continued community infection status of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of chickens affected by COVID-19, who will need health care and especially extreme therapy, as in the affected regions of Italy, the state of which has emerged.
As shown in recent ECDC quick risk evaluation, instead of inhibiting delays in the delivery of SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to take a quick, active, and universal perspective to avoid delaying, as if not implemented before time, the fast-term growth in such cases will not be the result of the decision makers and ruggets of their response to the assessment, accept and self-efficacy.
Public health measures have also been listed in the rapid risk assessment to eliminate the epidemic.
Here is a short period of opportunity during which countries can further expand their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this fails, it is likely that the health services systems of other EU/EEA countries will face the ugliness of those who will require excessive treatment within a few days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been caused by severe severe serious Schwsanrog (SARS) coronary heart disease 2 (SARS-COV-2) which has killed more than 3,000 people elsewhere in China and the world and has infected more than 80,000 people and has been a disaster for mankind.
In 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes thousands of people to become SARS-CoV, has also been infected by SARS-CoV-2, probably only from the ventricles and may have shown similar symptoms by the same system.
However, the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than SARS but there is greater constituency and is higher for men than the elderly and women.
As a response to the increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide the research topic at the right time and the inclusive revision.
We have dealt with the basics of epidemiology, etiology, Virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although the answers to many questions remain, we hope this review will help us to understand and cope with this dangerous illness.
The spring of January 25, 2020, was an unprecedented and unprecedented phenomenon for all Chinese people who were told to live in the entire facilities and weeks after the outbreak of the new infectious disease.
In 2003, this virus with coronary heart disease (CoV) caused by severe serious respiratory disease (SARS) is very similar, so on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization named it SARS-COV-2 and the naming of the associated disease as COV disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and across the whole of the world in 50 other countries.
By 2 March 2020, the virus resulted in 80,000 specific cases of COVID-19, with over 40,000 rugs being Discharged and the death of 3,000 Rugs.
WHO has warned that the number of COVID-19-Genesis is one enemy and is probably even more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) within two months, more than 200 researches have been published on COVID-19 since the first case recorded on January 7, 2020 has been included in its Virology, Epidemiology, Etyology, diagnosis and treatment, by which a series of viruses has been determined, except for the various rugs.
This review seeks to summarize the research progress in the subject field that is new and slow to develop.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coV diseases caused by SARS and other CoVs, the Middle East Schwhisan disease (MERS, 2012 eruption).
We will also discuss what we have learned about the prevention of disease and prognosis as well as about immediate issues, even though there are some shells.
CoVs are traditionally regarded as non-living diseases for humans, primarily by 15% of whose disease occurs.
In this century, however, our twice met with a very deadly human CoV i.e. SARS-COV and MERS-CoV, which started in China in 2003 and in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, and immediately spread to other countries with extreme fatal dissatisfaction and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV eruption in man's recent history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups of pneumonia with unknown origins were first recorded in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 by China National Health Ioga.
Seven days later, the order of CoV was issued.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was recorded at Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, it was reported that health care providers were infected which led to an observation that humans could be infected from humans.
On January 23, the whole wall was closed in the city of Wuhan, and all public transportation there was shut down.
On January 24, the first medical study on disease indicated that only 21 of those cases set out in 41 had direct contact with the Whuhan Cyfood Market which had been understood as the initial infection center from the unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the eruption as a global health investment.
Until the report was published, disease had already spread throughout China and in 50 countries around the world (Effected 2.2).
As conditions change rapidly, the final state and intensity of the eruption is still uncertain.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-Central study on the 8,866 Rugnets with 4021 confirmed rugs of COVID-19 has presented an update image of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHX_rHPXA1qHA2bdA).
SARS-COV-2 transitioned to people of all ages, but primarily targeted people from the ages of 30-65.
Of the infected people, half (47.7%) were 50 years old, less than 20 were, and only 14 were infected under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men than women (0.27/100,000)
COVID-19 mostly spread in the Hubei and surrounding city groups.
COVID-19 takes on average 5 (2-9) days from getting engaged.
The average wear period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average period from Lavan to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default repeater number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and was adjustable R0 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people prior to 23 January 2020 grew dramatically, corresponding to the great spread before the summer of China.
Rugin's death rate with certain cases was 1.4% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and Rugene's adjustable mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.002-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (purified), age (>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large and covered viruses including single thread of the cell RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta CoV are known to affect humans.
This covers Spikes (S) glycoproteins its cellular receptors Angiotensin-formative enzyme 2 (ACE2) and diapeptideal peptides 4 (DP4) build up the sequences for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and then triggers the synthesis of skin.
The infected RNA genome is released into the membrane; after making a copy of the virus genome, the genomic RNA covers the surrounding glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein, forming a Virione-like vesicicle that then combines with plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic order of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is found as a new type of beta-CoV which has been found in a 10-ordered pattern taken from the original center of the Toweran Cyfood Market in Juana.
SARS-CoV-2 is more consistent with MARS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscopy, SARS-COV-2 particles have been found in the very thin part of the substrate of the human yuanlice.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weak than S protein of SARS-CoV, which combination causes less serious infections than SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also create a new short protein, which is encoded by orf3b and is encoded by the membrane protein orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can probably play a role in infectious pathogen power and prevent the expression of IFN  taking; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or purpose.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. indicated that the whole-length of human ACE2 on the 2.9 α resolution has been indicated with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the dam structure that was open and closed had been united as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 diameter could bind two S proteins, which provide evidence of the identity and infection of the CoV.
B0AT1 for drug examination to overcome the SARS-CoV-2 infection may become a treatment target.
The original and middle host
It is known that both SARS-COV and MERS-CoV have emerged from the vents and that the sequences had reached humans from dug man and camels.
After the hereditary comparison with other CoVs of SARS-CoV-2, the ventrals were understood to be the local host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is equal to 96% with the fat-SL-CoVZX45 and the lower-SL-CoVZX21 named SARS.
However, it is unknown what medium carriers helped the virus by crossing the barrier of species to infect humans, and the way the transition is still to be clear.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes must be carriers to reach people from the ventrals, which may have occurred with asexual evidence during the S protein.
According to one study, researchers at Guangzhou in China have suggested that the long nacas used in traditional medicines, munga eat munga, can be the possible middle host of SARS-CoV-2, which has been found in the dug manger, found in the COV and SARS-COV-2.
However, there is still a great gap between 1% of the two genomes, so the solid evidence is waiting for a crucial conclusion (Genesis 33).
Material properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive in dry environments for 48 hours and live in 20 degrees Celsius and 40%-50% in humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can't hold a fever in the ultraviolet rays and at the temperature of 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes after 30 minutes, ether, 75% ethnol, chlorinated arthritis, parasatric acid, chloroform, and chlorheccin can effectively negate it.
Generally entire human beings cannot cope with SARS-CoV-2 and so she is vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no extensive study has been conducted in the immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to studies on other CoV, especially SARS-COV and MERS-CoV (Image 4).
Generally, when the virus attacks the host, the first of its pattern Receptors (PR) are introduced by the C-Type Lectin-Lic receptors, including the Toll-Laic receptor (TLR), NOD-Lei receptor (NLR) and the RIG-I-Laic receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways the virus induces the expression of organic elements, the maturity of dendritic cells and the type I interference (INN), which limits the spread of the virus and increases the rate of the macrophase phagocytosis of the viral antigen.
However, the N protein of Saars-COV can help the virus read from the response of the immune system.
Soon, favorable immune response virus joins in the fight against resistance.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a significant role in survival.
CD4+ T cells trigger B cells to create virus-specific antibodies and destroy CD8+ T cells directly to virus-independent cells.
To help rescue cells, T. Helper muscles produce the prosthetic cytokines.
However, COV T cells can prevent function by joining the apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immune forces including components and antibodies such as C3A and C5A are also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, the antibodies removed from the loose rugna have negated MRS-CoV.
The second baju, the extreme reaction of the immune system largely leads to the formation of localized free cell groups which can cause serious damage to lungs and other parts of the body and can damage various parts in bad conditions and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections that begin in the group are likely more likely to have older people and pregnant women.
Individuals who have other illnesses or whose immune system has been diagnosed are more likely to get involved than others.
SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have a moderate heat period of 1-14 days, most cases have been found in 3-3 days, such as in the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases has shown that the average heat period was 3 days and between 0 and 24 days.
As described above, very recent studies show that the summer period was 4.8 (3.0-.2) days in the population of 8,866 cases.
Combining the effective separation period on the basis of the most accurate heat period is very important for health care officials, which will prevent infected people from infecting others.
As a general solution, the virus has come in contact with the virus or has to keep those infected for 14 days in a dissociation often.
Is it necessary to do 24 days of dissociation period?
Temperature is the head and initial sign of covid-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry loss, shock, sneezing, headaches, scar bites, renolia, chest pains, diarrhea, gums, and vomiting.
Some rugs may become dyspenia and/or hypoxemia after a week after they have been sick.
In serious cases, the rugs are immediately caused by serious respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and cogulopathy.
With symptoms regarding fever and/or respiratory, and with severe fever, it is necessary that the virus be tested for the early diagnosis of the disease then why not even why the plmonary imaging abnormalities.
A population scientific study conducted in the late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms were as follows by 98%, dry hollow 76%, dysperia 55%, and diaria 3%; 8% of the rugs needed vintillation assistance.
The same conclusion has been found in two recent studies on a group that has been introduced by a group that has no family group and no symptoms.
Comparatively, the populationological study in 2012 has shown that MERS-COV rugs had also been diagnosed with fever (98%), dry skull (47%) and dyspenia (55%) in the form of major symptom.
However, 80% of them needed vintillation assistance, which was much higher than COVID-19 rugs, and had more fatalities than COVID-19.
The diary (26%) and the siege (21%) were also found in the MERS Rugs.
In the Saars Rougans, it has been seen that fever (99%-100%), dry skull (29%-75%), dyspenia (40%-42%), diaria (20-25%) and scraping (13-25%) was the main symptoms and that nearly 14% of the rugons were required vintillation base.
By February 14, when the evidence was reached in the world by 66,576, the death rate of Kovid-19 was 2%.
In contrast, by November 2002, Sirs' death rate was 10% of the cases confirmed by 8,096.
For MERS, there was 37% of cases of death rate 2494 confirmed on the basis of the populationological study in June 2012.
The earlier study indicated that the RO 6.47 of SARS-CoV-2 was so high and that 95% of 5.71-1.23's confidance interval (CI), while the ARS-CoV was between the RO 2 and 4.
In terms of symptoms, mortality, and RO, SARS-COV-2 are compared to MERS-COV and SARS-COV in Table 1.
It's suggesting above that MERS-COV and SARS-CoV are more likely to extend SARS-COV-2 than that of the two, however, is less fatal than those two.
Therefore, it is more challenging to control SARS-COV-2 epidemics than MERS-COV and SARS-CoV.
The sample start often starts in the same family or starts with the same vehicle, such as the same bid or crew ship.
Rugins have a history of travel or residence in the Wuhan or other affected area or have been contacted with infected people or are within the previous two weeks before they begin.
However, it has been indicated that people can wear viruses without symptoms for more than two weeks, and can reenact the cure that has been released from the Rugin's hospital to increase the duration of dissociation.
At the initial stage, the normal or subtraction number of rugs has peripheral goods of blood (especially lymphocytes).
For example, in the 1099 Kovid-19 rugs, limphopenia < 4×109/L containing < 1×109/L lymphocytes number and found advanced aminotransferase levels and Viremia.
Yuck and nerve enzyme levels and some of the myoglobin had been increased in the blood of the mugs and the C-reactive protein and irythrocyte layer had grown in the blood of most of the rugs.
In the rudiments of serious cases, the fibrin degradation product in the blood had increased levels of D-diamer and had decreased lymphocytes measured rapidly.
Most of the covid-19 rugs found abnormalities in the chest radiographies and are characterized by the shadow of the bilateral pan of the lungs or the Ground glass opiates.
Rugs often develop antipsychotic pneumonia, serious lung pain, and serious respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occurs, uncontrollable donors, fluid storage and progressive as fast as possible affects air exchange.
As the fracture in Type-1 and Type-2 Neumosites decreases the surface level and the surface tension increases, thus reducing the capacity for lung transmission and increasing the risk of lung damage.
Thus, the worst radiographic conclusions are often the most serious illness.
On February 18, 2020, the first diagnosis evaluation of COVID-19 showed that the desacvation of the Neumosites, the formation of the genetic screen and the formation of the mugna in the middle lymphocytes, and the multineucleated synapsy muscle in the lungs of the mugna who died from the ovulation and the ARDS of the viral infection are compatible with the disease and ARDS and are similar to the SARS and MERS Rugs.
Rivers-transscriptions Polymerase Chain Response (RT-PCR) was used as a major assessment to identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, the high false-neglecting rate of epidemics led to the use of medical publications for diagnosis in China on 13 February, 2020 (which is now not only dependent on RT-PCR).
Similar conditions arose along the diagnosis of Sassars.
Thus, the combination of disease history to make effective diagnosis, medical revelation, laboratory testing, and radiologic conclusions are important and essential.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK system to identify SARS-CoV-2, with a dipstick using a synthetic SARS-COV-2 RNA tissue within an hour without the need for extensive equipment.
Hopefully, if the therapy is verified in samples, the new system can perform dramaticly sensitive and facilities in aging.
Having a lack of experience about the new CoV, practitioners can only provide assistant supervision to COVID-19 Rugues and look at other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other virus disease (Tech 2) used previously on other coVs or proposed various treatment methods.
These treatment methods include present and possible treatments including antiviral drugs, immunospressants, steroids, the plasma of the exhaled rugs, and the immune system, including Chinese medicine and mental basis.
Not so much, it was proposed to use for treatment to the patients who were released.
Drug-making companies are trying faster to create antibodies and vaccines for poisoning.
SARS-COV-2 begins attack lungs and possibly attacks other parts that express ACE2, such as the system of solids and intestines and also has some degree of influence on the urine.
As a result, the failure of the respiratory system and the fractures lead to a great risk for the rugs and it is the leading cause of death.
Therefore, to relax from symptoms and save life, the respiratory system needs to have a basis, including normal oxygen treatment, high-floo oxygen, noninvolvesive ventiation, and invasive mechanical ventiation in accordance with the seriousness of the disease.
It is an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technique that is used for a fracture of fatal cardiac or respiratory systems.
It is also important to maintain electrolyte balance, prevent secondary infections and septic shock and to protect the function of major organs.
It has been known that the extra reaction of the disease system in SARS and MERS routines results in cytokine Storm.
The cytokine Storm is a form of systemwide delivery response which is seen as a series of cytokines that includes TNFα, IL-1α, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNα, IFNα, and MCP-1.
These cytokines trigger the cells of the immune system to release large numbers of free particles which are the main cause of ARDS and various components of fractures.
Immunospration is important in the treatment of cytokine Storms, especially for serious rubies.
Anti-IL6 monocolonal antibody is used to treat corticosteroids and Tosilizub cytokine Storm.
Other immunodepression treatments of the cytokine Storm include T muscle-directed immune response, IFN-way, IL-1, and TNF inhibit, JAK restriction, bilituomab, cytokine signaling 4's compressors and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunospressants in the treatment of saress to reduce the severity of asthma damage.
However, there was no greater benefit to the steroids for the severe pain of the lung in Saars and Kovid-19 ugnus.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects especially by abscular ostionecrosis, which can significantly affect the disease.
However, short treatment of corticosteroids in low to medium doses is being recommended to be carefully used for serious illness covid-19 rugs.
By the time it was written, no effective antiviral treatment had been confirmed.
However, it has been found to be effective when a U.S. Rugna by Kovid-19 gave RemDecivir by Shire.
RemDecivir, developed by Jillide to treat diseases initially caused by Ebola and Marlberg Viruses, is an amazing antiviral drug.
Later, Remdesvir demonstrated a potential constraint for other single stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Without this, Jillid provided this element to China to test the rugs that SARS-CoV-2 had and the conclusions that came to be very promising.
Additionally, BarysitnB, Interferon-α, Lopinavier/Ritonevir, and Ribavirin have been recommended as a potential treatment for the patients with serious symptoms of breathing.
The configured treatment of Lopinary/Ritonevir can lead to diaria, malt, reverse, jet damage, and other anti-retrovir reactions.
It is necessary to pay careful attention to the effect of these treatments on other drugs used in the rugs.
The formation of plasma and antibodies from the released rugs
Rugin's blood released from infectious disease has a long history after treating patients with the same disease or not to be infected by healthy people.
It is true that the number of antibodies is higher in the blood of the released rugs compared to the diseases.
The antibodies to fight diseases and other external substances are immunoglobulin (IG) that are created by B lymphocytes and are identified by specific molecules in the diseases and destroy them directly.
On this basis, cells were compiled from the blood of the Rugin Group, which was released from COVID-19, and 10 rugs who were seriously ill were toded.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, along with asthma and toxicity pressure, and also improved the transmission of blood animal life.
However, as long as certain treatment methods are not developed, tests and explanations are required for widespread use.
In addition, for treatmental effects, it is necessary to be carefully considered about some of the toes that are tied to the muscles.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the response of the immune system very much and can cause cytokine release syndrome, which is fatally toxic in the possible form.
The nucleus of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for cells to treat the seriously ill rug is great.
It is difficult for certain antibodies to develop and produce faster to fight with the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is important and practical to separate B cells from the purified rudiments and identify the anatomical codes that encode effective antibodies or examine effective antibodies against the essential proteins of viruses.
This way, we can increase the production of antibodies faster.
TCM has been used to treat different diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its impact, according to TCM's theory, is largely dependent on the configuration of various elements in the formula according to the diagnosis of the disease.
Most effective components are unknown or uncertain because it is difficult to draw and test such elements or their highest configuration.
Currently, since there is a lack of effective and specific treatment method for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients who have been cured from serious stages.
For example, Shufeng G. du capsules and lyan Hu Hui King vin capsule COVID-19 has been found to be effective for rugs.
For the treatment of COVID-19, 87% of the rugs found a higher level of healing in various regions of China that use the TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningsia (50%) and Hohan (50%), while the Hobby province where only 30% of the COVID-19 chickens were used to cure there.
However, this is a somewhat bold comparison because other effect factors such as the number of rugs and intensity should be included in evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, speech Zhang and colleagues published a study to compare only Western medicine (WM) with configured treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that body temperature was too low in the WM + TCM group than just the WM group.
Most importantly, the rate of symptomatic growth (usually to be severe) was very low in WM+TCM than just the WM group (7.4% against 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group was also low (39% against the WM+TM group).
However, for the effectiveness and security of the TCM, there is a great need to be done in more centers.
It would be somewhat strange to determine the features of the system of actions and explain the elements of TCM treatment or their configuration if possible.
Dissatisfaction or certain COVID-19, patients experience most of the extreme salient or fatal disease and even people in the dissociation experience boring, isolation and anger.
Also, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and missing and as well as the adverse effects of treatment, such as depression caused by corticosteroids, can cause anxiety and mental depression.
In the early stages of SARS eruption, there was a record of emotional distortions, such as constant depression, anxiety, panic attacks, emotional outbursts, sadistic symptoms, delusions, and feelings of self-esteem.
As part of public health response for the COVID-19 eruption, the mandatory magova of contact can be further concerned about the people's being infected, disorganized, and guilty in family and friends.
Therefore, the COVID-19 Rugin, the suspect person and those in contact with them and the generals who are in need must be provided with mental health care.
The mental basis includes regular and clear communication regarding the establishment of a multidimensional mental health group, the precise news and treatment plan regarding the emergence of SARS- CoV-2, the use of professional power tools and the use of applications to avoid close relationships with others.
This vaccine can also be used effectively for anti-inflammatory treatment to break down the spread chain that is occurring to sensitive hosts from infected humans and infected humans.
S is being attempted to develop a protein-based vaccine so that against SARS-CoV you can generate long-term and qualitative antibodies and/or protective disease.
For SARS, animal samples of live-driving vaccines were evaluated.
However, before starting medical studies, these lesions have not yet been explored with physical performance and fatal challenge models in older people and the protection elements in opposition to animal-producing virus infection.
The reason for this may be that the SARS effect had already ended 17 years ago and then no new case was recorded.
That is the fact that some common incidents of the meRS were emerging in the Eastern countries and the spread of other regions is beginning to appear to exist in the continental region.
Ineffective viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microorganisms, microorganisms such as viruses, and residual protein subunits were created to be lysed for MERS and some were evaluated on animal samples.
Developing safe and effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 for non-representable people is an urgent and important task for the current epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome difficulties because it requires long periods of time (Sarsary 18 months) to develop the vaccine and the dynamic diversity of the CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has begun to demonstrate its overall medical order in thousands of rugs.
In most cases, the rug can gradually recover without any repeated repercussions.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high distortion and mortality rate in serious cases.
Therefore, health care agencies need to build a disease model in especially resource-less areas to determine the priorities of their services.
Depending on the medical studies indicated so far, the following elements may be associated with or affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 Rogues (Tech 33):
Age: age for the diagnosis of SARS was the most important factor, which is also true for COVID-19.
As described above, in the study of the 8,866 cases, 47.7% of rugs aged over 50 years of age with COVID-19 were between 30-65.
Rugins who need deeper therapy were more likely to have an underlying disorder and vandalism and they were much older than those who did not so (in the middle age of 66 compared to 51), which suggests age for the Rudiment of COVID-19 was the disease factor.
Gender: as described above, SARS-CoV-2 infects men more than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000).
Coalition and confusion: COVID-19 that requires overdrinking therapy is likely to be involved with serious heart disease and lynnity problems.
In SARS rugs, heart disease was also one of the main causes of death.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been indicated that ACE-2 also binds positive collangiosites, which can cause a fracture in the ovID-19 rugs.
It is important to indicate that the relationship between age and present diseases is important and that they can affect each other.
Abnormal experimental conclusions: levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicate the severity of asthma or vomiting pain and is a possible long-term disease factor for disease, response to treatment and final recovery.
COVID-19 has also been indicated to associate CRP levels with severity and disease.
Additionally, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), espartate aminotransferases (AST), alline aminotransferases (ALT) and can also help to estimate the conclusion.
These impulses are expressed widely in various parts, especially in the heart and the ijk and the ti's damage.
Thus, they are a traditional spectator for the heart or the mess of the joic.
The major medical symptoms: the instantaneous growth of the female radiography and medical symptoms should be thought together with other problems to build the conclusion and complexity of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunospressants that are used in the form of helpful treatments for reducing the severity of asthma damage.
Due to the use of high doses of corticosteroids in serious SARS rugs, many survivors have been affected by the unsatisfactory ash and with the life-giving life-long life span.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses and short term doses in COVID-19 rugs if needed.
Mental stress: as described above, much of the rudimental stress during the outbreak of COVID -19 was involved because they had to stay in isolation for a long time and in a very uncertain state and had to witness the deaths of family members and assembly.
It is essential to provide mental complication and long-term assistance so that they will be healed from stress and return to normal life.
According to so far population scientific studies, the characteristics of COVID-19 are different than SARS.
The resonance of SARS-CoV-2 can be functionally higher in the respiratory tract than in the lower respiratory tract and may not cause mild or any symptoms in the initial phase of the infection, similar to other coVs that may lead to surgery.
Thus, the infected rugs in the initial stage or notion period can produce a large amount of toxicity during daily activities, which can make it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, when rugs are seriously ill, it is considered that the infection of SARS-CoV spreads, while most infections do not occur in the initial phase.
Thus, the current eruption of COVID-19 is more severe than the origin of SARS and is difficult to control.
In China, there are currently a great deal of efforts that are being made to be locked down in Wuhan and surrounding cities and that almost always keep the entire population in isolation, so that the spread of SARS-COV-2 can be stopped.
Although these actions are reaching a significant extent to the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new rugs is decreasing and which seems to reduce the epidemic.
The most promising estimate is that the eruption will end up until March and the slope step below will take up to 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter, guessing that COVID-19 who is feeling more infectious than SARS will not end up in 2020.
Ira Langini has established a model to predict the effects of epidemics and suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group has indicated that healing from the disease has been found in the Mid-Turbite and thrott Swab of the Rugna released 2 weeks ago, showing that the newly identified virus can occur in a circular squirrel like influenza.
However, on the basis of the reduced number of new cases, promising signs from China appear to have a positive effect on current defenses.
Early Ebola would cause tens of thousands of cases and five million deaths were initially initiated.
However, the disease was finally controlled by severe dehydration.
It is possible that as with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will also weaken until it is unaffected and will eventually be destroyed or with less diseaseic viruses that are associated with humans.
A comparison of COVID-19's epidemic with SARS and MERS are listed below ( Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is very infectious by digging or cooking and can also be caused by direct contact with contaminated material by poisoning.
The virus has also been found in the membrane, which has given rise to a new possibility of infection to the venom-to-tond.
A recent study conducted on 138 cases indicated that 41% of cases may have been diagnosed with hospital infections, with 17 rugs had other previous illnesses and 40 health services providers.
Therefore, it is necessary to be very careful to protect humans, especially those who come in contact with health services, social workers, family members, colleagues, and so on.
The first step of security to reduce the risk of infection is to use the face mask; both the surgical mask and the N95 receptor mask (zero #18060s) help prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks in the possible form prevent fluid points from moving from the air to the surface of the material, so that their infection will not happen to others.
However, only N95 (rich # 1860) masks can stop the respiratory of tiny viruses from 10 to 80 NM, with only 5% of the virus can enter completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to Saars-COV in size and both are approximately 85 NMR sizes.
As the particle can also enter from the five surgical masks that have one on one, it is necessary to wear an N95 (Shrunk # 1860) by health care providers who have direct contact with the Rugans.
Along with masks, health care providers also need to wear a fidgeted Isolation well to avoid contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect people with eyes.
On January 20, 2020, despite wearing an N95 mask, a doctor was infected with SARS-COV-2; the virus may have entered their body through their burning eyes.
Therefore, it is necessary for health care providers to use transparent face covering or google to work with rugs.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas is advised to wash their hands more often than usual, stay inside the house for self-veiling and limit contact with potential infected people.
Three feet are considered to be the correct distance to avoid the rug for people.
These actions have been considered effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came into the human universe as a new virus, as recorded on January 7, 2020, it was due to being gay with Sars-COV's awareness of the 2003 sars origins that caused the death of the alarming bells in China.
However, even on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan disease control center was telling people that the new virus is less infectious and less rehabilitated from humans to humans and it is not difficult to counteract and control the disease.
The message greatly reduced the sense of warning in the public especially when the entire country was preparing for summer and the important time in the Wuhan to keep the disease at least level.
The disease control agencies in China can take this lesson from hard lessons and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should take further precautions to ensure that (1) public announcements are more careful for citizens because each word they have been told is important and therefore may change their viewpoint and decision; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to the official reports of doctors or nurses; (3) instead of providing comfort to the public, it should be more restrictive to prevent possible association at an early stage; and (4) to promote public awareness about the sufferer's disease and test the community's response system and to improve it.
The outbreak of Covid-19 was due to the new virus SARS-COV-2 which began in the end of December 2019.
By the time this article was written, within two months he spread throughout China and in 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is similar to Saars-COV and because the symptoms are similar between Kovid-19 and Sasss, Kovid-19's eruption generated feelings like the return of the Sars.
However, Kovid-19 and Sars have some notable gaps, which are important in achieving control over the side disease and treating the rugs.
Kovid-19 is more affected by men than older and more than women, and is also more intense and mortality rate among older people than youth.
Saars' deathder is more than covid-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
Even if there are no covid-19 rugin symptoms, it is very difficult to prevent covid-19 spread of covides only after the Sars is seriously ill, so it has become very difficult to prevent covid-19 spread.
This makes it somewhat clear why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading more rapidly and wider than SARS-CoV.
A regular RNA evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some covid-19 rugs.
On the other hand, the cureed rug virus can be positive again.
These conclusions have significantly increased the risk of spreading toxicity.
This rapid progress in research on Kovid-19 has not resulted in a lot of significant issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there have been 96% of anat-COV between SARS-COV-2 and two Bat Sars-Lic COV, we cannot conclude that SARS-COV-2 has come from the ventricle.
Which animal medium was as a species to interact with virus from the original host, a ventriloquist or human?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we can't effectively stop the transition and ever return the eruption.
Although nuclear modeling and biosynthetic evaluation demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter Wiuniki's cells and then how does the disease change?
Does the virus also bind to the ACE-2 expression cells in other components?
With no clear answers to these questions, we cannot get quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the living conditions last?
How do viruses develop anarchy during transitions in humans?
Will he be a global illiteracy, like a sars, or will he be like a flu?
You need to find the answers to the above and the other many questions, but it may take some time for it.
However, no matter what happens, we do not have another option unless we make the accompanying application as soon as possible and normal our lives.
The Origin of the Animal Disease of Human Coronavirus
For thousands of years, coronation (CoV) and with humans are driven by the mutation and adaptations of their Posinator's co-evolution.
Prior to 2003, it is known that there are mild illnesses like colds due to two human coronary heart disease (HCOV).
The outbreak of severe serious respiratory disease (SARS) and middle eastern respiratory disease (MERS) has shown how devastating and fatal HCV infection has been.
In central China at the end of 2019, the rise of the Sars-COV-2 came back to light, and with its high compression potential, we were amazed but it had less disease compared to his easy-to-sars-COV.
HCOV infection is animal disease, and therefore it is hiatah for us to understand the root of the animal disease of HCOV.
Most HCOVs have originated from vendettas where they are non-inflammatory.
Some HCOVs have also been known by foreign possande.
For the prevention of human diseases, identifying the animal possin may directly result.
The detection of COV-Possibilities in animals can shed light on important information on COV disease among humans.
In this review, we are presenting an overview of the existing information of the seven HCOV, whose main focus is on the history of their research, as well as the original and interrelation of their animal disease.
Importantly, we compare the development of viruses and different HCOVs from the view of genome evidence.
Current COV disease 2019 (Covid-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need to successfully change the Possinian has been highlighted and the effects of the virus's evolution on the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Coronavirus (COV) is related to the family of Coronaviride, which includes a group of desired, positive-sensed, single-put RNA viruses.
Since these RNA viruses shelter the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases, they look like a crown under electron microscope, they are called a 7COV.
Structurally, COVs have undivided genomes that summarize the same structure.
About two thirds of the genome has two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted to pp1a and pp1ab repliques polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to create 16 non-configurable proteins, whose NSP1~16 is assigned a sequence.
The remainder of the genome includes the ORF for structural protein, including Spikes (S), Envalp (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprotein (N).
countless hereditary-specific substituents are also encoded by different descendants of COV.
In accordance with the order of different proteins, COVs are classified into four generations (alpha-COV, island-COV, gamma-COV and Delta-COV), of which the beta-COV generation consists of the most HCOVs and they are divided into four generations (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that ventricles and molds serve as a custom resource for most alpha-COVs and beta-COVs if the birds are the main pods for gamma-COV and delta-COV.
For thousands of years, the COV has constantly crossed the barrier of populations and some have emerged as important human diseases.
Today, seven human COV (ACOV) are known.
Among them are HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are Alpha-COV.
The other five beta-COV includes HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe serious respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Sars-COV), middle eastern respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (mers-COV) and sar-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKEu1 and HCOV-NL63 cause normal mild symptoms such as cold and/or excessive.
On the other hand, sars-COV, Mars-COV, and newly introduced sars-COV-2 are highly susceptible, with relatively low respiratory infections in more patients who are at the risk of severe respiratory distress prevention (ARDS) and extrapalmonary manifestation.
In 1960, the first HCOV-229E disparities were separated from the nose of ordinary cold patients, B814.
Since then, more knowledge was stored through extensive studies on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, producing self-dead symptoms.
Thus, by the eruption of Sass, it was widely understood that the infection caused by HCOV was generally nonexistent.
The eruption of Sars, which occurred in 2003, was one of the most destructive eruptions in current history, which infected over 8,000 people with an estimated 10% Crude case death.
Ten years later, the Middle East Swassan Assembly (Mars) eruptions resulted in a constant co-ordinary outbreak on the Arabian Islands which spread throughout the rest of the world.
The new HCOV of 2019 (2019-NCOV) which was later named as SARS-COV-2 was the critical medium of the ongoing association of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), who had died more than 3,120 by March 3, 2020, and had infected more than 91,000 people.
The threat bell is constantly on and the world needs to be prepared for the coming Sarss-COV-2.
All seven EssioVs are the root of the animal disease in the ventriloquists, molds, or pet animals.
Various evidence reinforces the theory of the origins from venoms, in which the virus took into account the condition and not the disease itself, but the strange anarchy variations are showing.
Covid-19 Saarroga presents massive medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges in front of China and the world.
Once the roots of Essiovy's animal disease have been raised, the design of the natural history, motion force, and restrictions of the survival of the species.
This will also guide or facilitate the discovery of the shelter of the Sarss-COV-2, the mediator, and the prosthetic parasite (v) possinda, which will make important actions to prevent its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a review of the origins of animal disease, inter-development and the diagnosis of HCOV.
In particular, we emphasize the following common topics and discuss that HCOV's parents viruses are not commonly infected in its natural parasite pods but become illustrative when an intermediate disease occurs in the new Posindia.
We also covered the art of HCOV evolution that if there was an increase in infection, the disease rate was reduced.
It was also discussed in the same context as the result of the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 that is currently starting.
Since the late 1930s, there has been information about animal COV.
From the fluid in the patient's nose, HCOV-229E distortion B814 was separated from different COVs of various infected animals before the first time separated, including turkey, undir, cow, pigeon, manger, and dog.
In the past decades, seven HCOVs were identified.
A brief summary of the discovery of HCOV in order of chronological order will be informative and informed.
The first HCOV-229E dissociation was separated from patients with the infection of the upper respiratory disease in 1966 and then the growth of the WWI-38 lung muscle lines.
HCOV-229E showed signs of coldness in infected patients with headaches, chimpanzees, cannons and wounds, and along with 10-20% cases of fever and skull.
Later in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was separated from the small mold organ calculus and then the serial Passage in the brain.
The medical features of the HCOV-OC43 infection were seen to be similar to the infection carried by HCOV-229E, which can be distinguished from symptoms such as influenza A virus and other respiratory diseases such as Rinoviruses.
Both HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 have spread worldwide, and they are primarily transmitted during the winter season in low temperature environments.
Generally speaking, the ubiquitous period of these two viruses is less than a week after about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study on human volunteers, HCOV-229E has developed a mild cold in infected healthy people.
Only a few weak disease patients see a severe infection of lower respiratory disease.
Saars, which is called the 3APCal mnemonics 1 which was the HCOV that was first properly documented in human history and is the etiological factor Sars-COV, the third founding HCOV.
The first case of Saars was found in the Guandong province of China at the end of 2002.
Saars' accompanying disease resulted in cases of 8,096 recorded with 774 deaths that spread into many countries and continents.
Without over-producing, it is estimated that each case can account for approximately two secondary kesenas, with a boiling period of 4 to 7 days and can be seen on the tenth day of the sickness of the top of the virus's influence.
SARS-COV can cause the infected patients to suffer from initial sneeze, headaches, fever, particle and cold, and then painlessness, skull, and later respiratory problems.
Lysicapesi rhasus , corrupted sexual activity testing and growing actitin Kinases are common abnormalities found in the laboratory of the Sarss.
Diffuse Alveler damage, high muscle growth and growth in macrophages have also been found in the Sars Rugs.
It is estimated that 20-30% of patients then require extreme susceptibility and mechanical airflow.
Along with the lower breathing, the joints and intestines may also be infected with this serious illness, often as well as cytokine storm, which can be deadly for patients with the immune system.
The virus was first separated from the open Long biopsy of the patient's relative to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, an unlimited effort has been made to research HCOV.
In late 2004, HCOV-NL63 was separated from a 7 month-old baby in the Netherlands.
He had been found more in patients with the initial child, elderly and ill-depressed hearings.
The disease caused by HCOV-NL63 is common in cold, eyes coming, fever, and respiratory disease.
In another free study in the Netherlands, the same virus was also separated from the nose of a 8 month-old child who was diagnosed with pneumonia.
Although it has been found in the Netherlands, it has spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 is responsible for 4.9% of normal respiratory diseases, and its most dominant is at the beginning of summer, summer and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive continuum, which is also called cs.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was separated from the 71 years old who were introduced to the hospital for pneumonia and Schwsinikashoth in Hong Kong.
HCOV-HKU1, along with the communityly received mnemonics and Schwsinikashotha, is associated with severe asthma viccupation.
HCOV-NL63, as HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 also find HCOV-HKU1 around the world that causes mild disease of respiratory.
All four of these are socially received HCOVs in human beings and are less likely to change in highly terminal diseases, although even unknown factors may also cause accidents as it happened in more toxic subtypes of HCOV-NL63, which have been reported in very recent cases due to the severe infection of lower respiratory infections in China.
Generally, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to interact efficiently and continue to hold constant strains in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogens.
Mars-COV was first separated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient's lung in Saudi Arabia which had caused severe pneumonia and obesity disorder.
Although most confirmed Cases were originated in the Middle East, close contact was recorded in various European countries and Tunisia, which imported cases of secondary broadcasts on occasion.
The second second eruption had arrived in South Korea in 2015 with the cases of 186 confirmed cases.
Mars' medical signs are similar to sars, which can be seen through progressive severe pneumonia.
In contrast to Sarss, the older rugs possessed by Mars were faced with the serious complications of obesity, which is very unusual for mares in diseases caused by HCOV.
The number of rugs that were found to have digestive symptoms such as extremes and vice versa was greater than 30%.
By February 14, 2020, there had been a record of more than 2500 confirmed cases in which there were 34.4% of the cases that died, which had become one of the most destructive viruses known to MERS-COV mankind.
From the mid-19th, between the end of December 2019, groups of pneumonia patients who were known in Wuhan in the province of Ubei, China began to appear.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a lower respiratory infection caused by Sass-COV-2 as a public health investment of international concern and naming the disease as Kovid-19.
By March 3, 2020, there had been evidence of 90,053 cases around the world, whose crew case was 3.4% of the death standard.
Significantly, the death rate of China's Hubei cases was 4.2%, while the same was 1.2% outside.
Sass-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as sars-cioV and mars-siovy which is seen by fever, skull, and respiratory disease.
In some rugs, too, there was plenty to see.
Neumonia was one of the most serious symptoms, and its rapid increase in serious respiratory pida synthesis.
Although high nucleotide sequence comprehension is very similar to sers-COV and sars-COV-2, they are in different branches in the filogenetic structure.
As you look like that, SARS-COV-2 is less susceptible to disease but is more inconvenient than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Sass-COV-2 has been recorded by the rugs without infected symptoms and they may have contributed to its rapid spread around the world.
When compared to six other HCOVs of Sass-COV-2, there are largely similarities and differences.
First, the period of fever and HCOV disease is very similar.
In this context, Saars-COV-2 follows the normal trade of six other HCOVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of covid-19 is between the sers-COV and the HCOVs received from the four community (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-Hkeu1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, sars-COV-2 is representing characteristics that are found during the infection of normal HCOV, including non-specific, mild, or none of the symptoms.
On the other hand, even if the amount is low, even in cases of sers-COV infection, there is also a small subsidy of the serious cases of Kovid-19 .
Third, the transition of sars-COV-2 from the community shows the characteristics of the ugly patterns of both HCOV and sars-COVs.
On the one hand, the transitionability of sars-COV-2 is as high as the HCOV received from the community.
On the other hand, as in the case of Sass-COV and Mars-COV, there is the rest to confirm if the transition potential of sars-COV-2 was reduced when transmitted to humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be seen in twisted patterns.
It is intended to be clear from future studies if the cir-COV-2 from the venom-momental transition in at least some circumstances plays a key role similar to Sars-COV.
Just like the cases of HCOV received from the community, it would also be boring to see if Saars-COV-2 also shows violence.
Nevertheless, after the spread in man, the features of the Sars-COV-2, including the features of the present beginning of covid-19, will be effective for the final future of the origins of the origins of the present.
HCOVs obtained from all four of the communities that produce mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it can also be true that humans have well adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both may be survivors from the ancient HCOV association.
HCOV that produces serious diseases in humans and should be brought to destroy serious HCOV diseases generated by humans.
To make this happen, until enough to save a custom mutation, HCOVs should become a representation among humans that will alter the restriction elements of the Posinda.
In this sense, the eruption of Saars-COV-2 will take as long as it will infect the more people, it is more likely to be fully adaptable to humans.
If he is well suited, it will be difficult to stop his spread between humans through dissociation or other infectious control measures.
Four COVs received from the community for many years are spreading among humans which is increasing to those with the immune system.
These viruses do not require animal shelter.
At that point, very ill-treated SARS-COV and MERS-CoV did not properly adapt to humans and their transition between humans will not last.
They need to maintain and spread their animal shelters and to spread through one or more intermediate and extrinsic porcelains possible to the sensitive human target.
The features of Sarss-COV-2 are the same in both the Sars-COV/Mors-COV and the four HCOV from the community.
Even at least now, it is highly contractable, like HCOV obtained from the community.
However, it is more diseaseier than the HCOV obtained from the community and is less likely to be worse than Saars-COV or Mars-COV.
They would be fully adaptable with humans without shelter or mediator, and would continue to see if they would spread them in humans.
Before discussing animal roots of HCOVs, it would be appropriate for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of HCOV's evolutionist, natural, invasive location, mediator, and deliverer posinda.
An animal can become the possidual of the evolution of HCOV if it has given shelter to a close related ancestor that comprises high understanding at the level of nucleotide sequence.
In this potion, the ancestor virus is often optimized and is not diseaseatic.
Similarly, the parasite posinda gives HCOV shelter for constant and long term.
In both cases, the Posinda is naturally infected and has a natural possion of HCOV or its parent virus.
At the same time, if HCOV is put into the middle host just before or during the introduction of it into humans, it does not adapt with the new Potions and often becomes ill-organized.
These intermediate possinds can then serve as animal pods of human infection, and provide the morgues to make the virus a moment copy and cross the role of the prosthetics and then interact with humans to expand the scope of human infection.
An HCOV infection may end if it is unable to maintain its infection in the middle position.
On the other hand, HCOVs can adopt middle-seducated podcasts and establish a long-term disease.
In this case, the middle podinda becomes a natural parasite.
Data regarding the accompanying disease has already been opened with preoccupation that the contact history of the first case of Sass has been seen with hunting animals.
The subsequent seroprivels findings showed that in addition to the generals, anti-sars-COV-IIG's trend was seen to a greater extent.
In the living animal market, masked Palm Sevents (Paguma Larvatta) and Recon dog was first recognized as venoming poisonings such as sars-COV- that were similar to Saras-COV.
The fact that no more sars were recorded after all the Soviets in the market had been killed, it was indirectly strengthened.
However, it was also noted that the masked Palm Sevens in the forest or fields that did not have contact with the living animal market were the only negative for most Sars-COV, it was suggested that the masked Palm Sieves would probably be the middle-sievet capital but would not have the natural shelter of the Sars-COV.
Significantly, 80% of different animals in the Guangzu market had anti-sars-COV antibodies, so different species of small mammals also cannot be denied the possibility of working the middle-progress possin for sars-COV.
All of this is seen as the final posing of the Sass-COV.
The subsequent discovery of the natural animal possion of Sass-COV led to a close-related ventricle COV, which was called the Sars-connected Rinoloops Bat COV HKU3 (Sars R-RH-BatsioV- HKU3), which exists in the Chinese Horseshu swarm.
These tendons are positive for anti-sars-COV antibodies and sars R-RH-batsioV- HKU3's genome order.
This and other ventricle sars-COV with 88-92% of nucleotide sequence understanding.
These studies designed the foundation for the new concept that the ventricles feed on human diseases that develop.
Many sars-like COV (SL-COV) were identified from vents but none other than WIV1 was able to be separated as a living virus.
Human angiotension Converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered the receptor of the sers-COV.
WIV1 was obtained from a sample of the vesicles which were shown to be used as a granite for cyvet, sivate, and human ACE2 Na membrane access.
The interesting fact is that the bloodletting of the sarciss patient who was raised from the disease was able to upset WIV1.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of Saars-COV in the ventricle as a 95% nucleotide sequence of understanding.
Although there is a high understanding between these two viruses, it is generally understood that WIV1 is not the middle parent virus of the Sars-COV and the ventrals are not the temporary parasite possions of the sers-COV.
The hereditary analysis combines Merc-COV into the same group as COV-HKU4 and Batt COV-HKY5.
Stutter COV-HKU4 and Merc-COV Posinda Grai, use diapeptideal peptides 4 (DP4) for toxic access.
The order of RNA-dependent RNA polymers of Mars-COV is relatively close to the representations found in the Bat beta-COV in Europe and Africa.
Until now, no living mars-siOV has been found in the wild vent.
Only 87% of nucleotide sequences are understood between the bat COV-HKEU25 which is closely related to Mars-COV and its relationship to it.
In this way, it may be possible that it is not a temporary parasite of the mars-COV.
On the other hand, studies conducted in the Middle East have been unconvinced that the dormedary camel is the seropositive to the Merc-COV specific inactive antibodies, as the camel of the Middle East can be found in many African countries.
Living Mars-COV is similar to the virus found in humans that separated from the Swab in the Dramamedry camel nose, further showing that camels serve as the beneficial parasites of Mars-COV.
It is interesting to note that with normal mild symptoms, however, the large amount of toxicity experimented with mars-COVs resulted in destabilization of shelter in the infected camel.
Significantly, the bound camel is not only hoping for viruses in the way of breathing but also in a hobby-direct approach, which is also the main way to shelter the virus from the ventilator.
However, the question remains that there is no contact history with camels before many cases confirmed by Mars, human-to-human transitional paths or unknown transition paths in which non-known species of animals are likely to be sheltered.
Saars-COV-2 summarizes the nucleotide understanding with 96.2% of the bat COV RATG 13 separated from the vents associated with the reynolphus.
As is in the case of Sass-COV and Mars-COV, the order variation between Sars-COV-2 and RATG 13 is very good to determine parental relations.
From this you should say that it is possible to not have a parasite poshida(de) of sars-COV-2, until there is exactly the same thing as bat-COV in the future.
Many of the middle posinda animals of Saars-COV-2 must be in the wild population that Hunan Cyfood Holesell market must have been sold and killed, including many of the earliest cases related to Kovid-19, which are a preview of the possible occurrence of the animal-to-humans.
countless researches on the basis of the metagenomic order have indicated that a group of small mammals in the crisis that are known as pangolins (Manis Javinica - Cave Manger) may also be the shelter of the extant beta-COVO associated with Sars-COV-2.
These new pangolins associate understanding of COV GNOMEs 85-92% nucleotide order with sers-COV-2.
However, they are closely related to the RATG13 in the proportion of approximately 90% at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They group in two sub-shells in a sage-COV-2- such as the velocities of the Sars-COV-2-, one of those who is more close to the granny bond domain (RBD), a 97.4% amino acid order that comprises identification.
In contrast to the extreme truth, the RBD of Sass-COV-2 and RATG13 are much more different, however high ratios are a high amount of GNOME-WP understanding order.
Recent research on disease pangolins has also been recorded to find a layer of toxicity on the lung sample, which has been found to be relatively relative to a relatively relatively relative to sers-COV-2.
This research adopted a different Assembly method and physical coverage to create about 86.3% partial GNOME order of full length.
We cannot discard the possibility of having a pangolins of the middle animal pods of SARS-CoV-2.
However, since the order between Sass-COV-2 and Pangolins sar-COV-2-connected beta-COV, there is no currently any evidence for support of the origin of Sars-COV-2 as it is directly Pangolins.
In addition, the distance between Sass-COV-2 and RATG13 is also relatively lower than the distance between Sass-COV-2 and Pangolins Sass-COV-2-connected beta-COV.
It remains to be established the way of the evolution of sass-COV-2 in ventricle, pangolins, and other mammals.
In fact, the most abundant order understanding is found in the RBD between Sass-COV-2 and Pangolins, sars-COV-2-connected beta-COV, sars-COV-2 and RATG13 are most common in the GNOME-WIP order understanding.
Pangolins sars-COV-2-connected beta-COV's and selectively-responsively-educated keela community evolutionist with a large concentration of similarities between the Sars-COV-2's RBD.
Pangolins sars-COV-2 related beta-COV and third wild animal species have an alternative proposal in the advantage of recontribution between RTG13 in the species.
As the motivation force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-COV.
The jury are still looking for the early animal origin of Sarss-COV-2.
Despite the high proportion of disease HCOV, it has also been studied with the animal origins of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63, and HCOV-Hkeu1.
The hereditary evidence has shown that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229 E have both emerged from the COV of the ventricles, while HCOV-OC43 HCOV-Hkeu1's parent virus has been found in animals that are quarters.
It has been reported that the COV in the ventricle was found in the ARCOV.2 (Aplacian Ridge COV) north U.S. Tithing, he has shown a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is associated with a factor in another ventricle COV, which has been named as the Hipposideros/Ganaquam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, at the same time the ants were suspected of being their mediator's pods.
For explanation, the animal knowledge of the HCOV in Figure 1 and Table 2 is provided in summary in the current knowledge on origin.
In history, the evidence of HCOV's intermediary transition is presented through hereditary analysis.
When HCOV-OC43 from domestic animal reserves around the 1890s crossed the species to bond humans, the companion of the respiratory institution was recorded.
The Internet transition history of HCOV-229E is very clear.
Bat alpha-COV, closely related to HCOV-229E, has been found.
Among them is a alpaca alpha-COV.
There are several levels of evidence that support direct infection of the virus in humans from the ventricle.
Firstly, it is possible that humans, not Alpacas, had come into contact with cynics in the social environment.
Instead, man has a more close contact with the alpacas.
Second, HCOV-229E-connected ventricles are separate and non-inflammatory in alpha-COV waves, at the same time, al-COV has been responsible for the outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, Alpaxus alpha-COV was not found in wild animals.
In this way, alpakkas cannot also be excluded from the possibility that HCOV-229E-connected alpha-COV was obtained from humans.
In fact, ventriloquisms are direct sources of human disease including ribose virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
It is therefore nothing surprising that the ventrals can infect the HCOV-229E directly into humans.
Alternatively, the Bat Alpha-COV is a genetic storage of HCOV-229E, alpapacas and Dromederry camels can serve as intermediate posings that can interact with viruses in humans, as in the case of Merc-COV.
Mars-COV has served as the best example of the Internet transition from the ventricle to the dormitory camel and from the dormitory camel to the tramedry camel.
The evolution of Mars-COVs from the ventriloquist is known for its early identification and has also been brought up with reinforcement by subsequent findings.
It is open that ventriloquisms provide rich deposits of species for the interoperability of genetic fragments and internal populations.
All of these ideal circumstances have set the trends as ideals as the 'violence broadcaster' of settlements, the relatively social interaction, and the ability to fly.
On the other hand, Mers-COVini has been admitted to the Doromedery camel for decades.
These camels have well adopted them who have made them stable and natural parasite possadas from the middle pods.
Mars-COV is caused by a very mild disease and retains relatively low mutation rates in these animals.
It is an accident for humans in their small proportions to be convergence, and man remains the phase of the Mars-COV because it does not survive this transition.
The role of camel in the transmission of Mars-COV is, in the consent of sars-COV-2, the role of the pangolins, if anything, is different in opposition.
Especially, Pangolins Bita-COV is a high degree of disease in pangolins.
They can be a stepparent for sars-COV-2-related beta-COVs, as is true in the cases of sars-COV.
Future research should be considered or rejected from the animal of Sass-COV-2 to man the countless possibilities for Internet infection.
Firstly, the ventricle can be parasites of sers-COV-2 related viruses, similar to that of sars-COV-2.
Humans can sanitize the environment by cutting it or through coal mining.
Second, Pangolins, these may be one of the Possins that promote intermediates who have the identification of sers-COV-2-connected virus has been isolated.
Human contact with viruses is by eating raw and hunted fish.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are sensitive to sers-COV-2.
For antibodies, there must be a survey of pet and wild animal.
Third, as noted above, the recombination and acceptance of sars-COV-2 can be found in the third population which are in contact with the ventral and pangolins.
The discovery of animal origin of Sars-COV-2 is still beginning.
There are also three main factors on the side of the COV virus in order to be convenient to cross the barrier of another species without different types of animal possins.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA antibodies is.
When comparing with other single-put RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of COV is dependent on the step of accepting COV by the new Posindian, the average replacement rate can be calculated to be 3th of 3th of every 2 sites per year -10-4 replacement.
COV has proof-reading xorribonuclease, which by removing it, results in a high-scale mutation overflow and even very life potential.
Amazingly, the nucleotide analogie remdesvyir is known for copying this xorribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
One of the most promising remdesives is an agent in opposition to the Sars-COV-2 that is tested in the Chichitsalien test.
Yet, the mutation rate of COV is about a million times higher than their position rate.
In addition, the mutation rate is always high when the COVS is not well accepted by the pawn.
Compared to a Sars-COV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of Sars-COV-2 is clearly low, implying the acceptance of the human at higher levels.
Likely they have already been accepted by other pods near humanity.
This also applies to Mercs-COV as a filling in sars-COV-2, which has been well accepted by the dronedry camel.
organicly, it is impossible that the old apneaan will become aquarium and aty-wirel as opposed to sers-COV-2.
Second, large RNA GNOME in COVs draws additional amounts of flexibility in GNOME corrections for mutations and recombination, which enhances the possibility for inter-independent co-evolution, when the situation becomes consistent, it is beneficial for the emergence of Novell COV.
This is supported by a very large number of other open readable frames and by a protin activity that is registered to 3' at the end of GNOME.
Thirdly, COV switches the template between RNA representations by memory and frequency of others such as 3copy-new-through mechanisms.
They act as containers of mixing in the Posindia, strand switching occurs repeatedly between the transcription of the COV RNA.
In order to create a new COV, the understanding of the high ratios of full length and sub-genomic RNA can be recombinated.
The hereditary evidence of natural recombination is found in both HCOV-HKYu1 and HCOV-OC43, similar to the COV of the animal, such as the ventricle SL-COV and the ventral COV-HKEU.
The interaction between virus-posynthesis in relation to infection
In addition to the three virus factors listed above, toxicity interaction with the Posinda receiver is another important factor that is influential in the Internet infection.
Here, the recombination of Saars-COV has taken as a pattern example, which has also shown evidence of positive choice between Internet transition events.
On the basis of comparative analysis between the separations of humans and Sivette Sass-COV, it seems that Sass-COV has been rapidly adopted in different Posindia, especially with mutations in the RBD of S protein.
Generally, in the RBD in S protein, the COV is interacting with the professional receiver and is selected by excitedly by the perceptual response of the Posin.
In Saars-COV, RBD is on the S1 continent from 318 to 510th amino acid, which is similar to human ACE2 that binds the receivers with them to virus access.
The RBD of Saars-COV is to the receivers of various animal ACE2, including the ventrator, Udranger, and rakun dogs, allowing for interoperability of viruses that are capable of recognizing them.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be different in the RBD between humans and the Sivate virus diluted and 4 of them are located in the recipient-related image for interaction with ACE2 receivers.
In Sivette Saars-COV, K489N and S487T mutants are in their RBD, which can induce the desire of the interaction of the spike protein with human ACE2 receivers.
If you want to say in another word, the replacement of these two amino acids may be important in toxic acceptance for humans.
It is important to note that Saars-COV-2 share the same professional recipients with Sars-COV.
In S1 unit of S protein, S. Protin warns the 30% difference between Sass-COV-2 and Sass-COV that the bonded will may have been changed with human ACE2 of their SP protein.
Of course, a Krayo-EM study has shown that the desire of these hostages is greater than the bond between humans ACE2 and Sars-COV S protein.
It would also be easy to determine the need for any other co-operator for the transition of sars-COV-2.
HCOV-NL63 must also be often associated with ACE2, however with a different part of S.
There are also numerous HCOV glands, such as 9-O-acsitated sialic acid for HCOV-229E, and HCOV for HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successfully accepting these COV's humanities after inter-development from their animal nutrients.
As a fill in professional granaries, the effect of HCOV's inter-development is also controlled by the dependence and restriction factors on other nutrients.
Dissociation of this nutrient protein between the natural storage nutrients of HCOV, such as human and ventricle, dromedry camel, and liver, can be an obstacle to the interoperability of the membrane.
HCOV Na successful Internet interaction requires nutrient dependence components to be forced and the nutrients must be utilised.
In this context, this significant toxicity-particle interaction part would remain known to the linear determinations and their characteristics are determined.
The choice may be useful by using modern technology of CRISPR for Sars-COV-2 which is not a predecessor of the gnome-vy and prevention elements of nutrient dependence.
The emergence of new HCOV: going back to zero again
The variation of the COV of the ventricle provides plenty of opportunities for the emergence of the new HCOWNOhi.
Thus, the ventricle COV is employed as a genetic storage of HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombinations produce HCOVs and serve as two important stages of this process.
For example, the dominance or damage of new protein-coding genes has the power to optimize the viral visual nature.
In sars-COV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 is considered as important as being accepted in humans, because sars-COV-connected ventral membranes are found in encoding the Ausary ORF8 proteins.
In the tribal type of disease separated with humans, it has been characterized by the removal of 29-nucleotides of sers-COV.
Because this has been removed, the ORF8 divides it into ORF8a and ORap8B and it is considered Swakarah mutations, which encourage the migration of nutrients.
In addition, Saars-COV has a history of possible recombination with the lineage of alpha- and gamma- COV, with large number of recombinations found in RNA.
The location of the reprogramming was also identified in NSP 9, in a large NSP10, and in some parts of the NSP 14.
Similarly, it has been shown that Sasorg Mars-COV has experienced redesign events in different tribalities, which have been found in the Doromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to Sass-COV and Mars-COV, redesign events have also come to be explanatory in this other HCOV, in which HCOV is recombinated in their non-commercial genes with the other animal's COV.
Viruses may also contribute to artificial selection in the unintended change of GNOME, which often results in freedom from the selective pressure used by the immune immune system.
The HCOV-229E prototype is an example of this effect that causes the loss of a full-length ORF4 and the removal of two-nucleotides.
Unified ORF4 can be found in the ventral and camel virus associated with HCOC-229E, showing the small alpha-COV single nucleotide addition, resulting in the frameshift.
The last but this is not the final, the evolution of new HCOV is also made possible by the pressure of selection between their parasite pawns.
Lately or only mild symptoms were found when the ventilator was bound by the COV, which indicates mutual acceptance between the COV and the ventral.
It seems that the ventriloquism accepted the COV as physically and physically well.
For example, the fault in activation of the pre-generation response in the ventricle is reduced to the efficiency of the distortions performed by COV.
In addition, the natural marak muscle activity in the ventilator is suppressed due to the vertical concentration of Ghrane NKG2/CD74 and the lower level of the major ubiquitous composite category I molecule.
In addition, both of the reactant oxygen type (ROS) derived from the high-chapalous action of the ventricle, the high concentration of the COV copy reacts with the reaction and results in the profendigue by Xorybonuclease, in this way when it enters the new nutrient, the origin of the venomone's lineage provides the selection pressure to be largely susceptible.
The more diseased COV ancestry was also evolved into recombination, which was leading to overriding new protein or protein features to adopt nutrients.
Thus, in the last two decades, these three new HCOVs are not caused by mistake.
COVs are due to non- problematic or mild symptoms in their parasitic position such as vents or camel.
Those strong possinda produce a passive representation without removing the immune response.
Here is why the carriers suddenly appeared, and the hidden secret of what is causing a serious problem in the human infection.
Serious symptoms are found primarily due to the high activation of the immune response and cytokine storm, while the immune response seems to be more powerful, in a more severe form of lung damage.
At the same time, in the carrier, the immune response from copying the COV is violet.
The sars-COV-2 healing method may have a beneficial strategy to break down the same immune response.
In particular, the response of the interferron in the ventricle is strong.
Thus, the management of at least the type-I interferon should be beneficial in the early stages of the infection of sers-COV-2 in humanity.
In addition, NLRP3 of the ventricle is bugged by the induced activation.
Because of this, the MCC950 co-consuming of the NLRP3 provider can be useful in the treatment of Kovid-19.
The emergence of Sarss-COV-2 follows the general approach, by which it triggers Sarss-COV and Merc-COV.
In the reverse ventriloquist beta-COV, 95% of nucleotide understanding was linked with sers-COV, there is also a 96% nucleotide understanding with sers-COV.
However, the market's udinger and other animals were not immediately recognized as the shelter for viruses such as Saars-COV, although the middle possions for Sarss-COV-2 were not immediately recognized.
The understanding of Sars-COV-2 in Pangolins beta-COV has been astonishingly found, which shows that pangolins may be acting as one of the middle pods or that Pangolins beta-COV has contributed to genetic fragmentation in the final version of the sers-COV-2.
Yet the question remains as if Sass-COV-2 has no evidence that it is ever conscious or by accident that humans are created.
Due to the outbreak of recent sars-COV-2, the COVs that have come back to the ornaments of fame.
The study in ventriloquisms and other animals has changed dramatically about the importance of the parasite Posilo of its animal origin and human circulation.
The evidence of spread showed that there was the root of the ventriloquist between Sass-COV, Mars-Siovy, and Sars-COV-2 and its transition in human beings was through the middle position Possin.
The origin of the infection of Saars-COV was by contact with humans and Ud Manger's market, by shutting down the market of marine food and killing the Ud Manzarna that was there, Sars-COV ended the accompanying disease effectively.
For the same reason, Pangolins must also be removed from the market of marine food to prevent the discovery of the founding of the multiple ancestry of pangolins beta-COV.
However, from pangolins and other mammals in the future research, humans have been infected with sers-COV-2 and remains to explain how.
On the other hand, Mars-COV has long existed in the Dromedery camel.
This is an important means of camel transportation, at the same time it remains the main source of meat, milk, skins, and wool products for local people.
They are widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of Mars, as China's wild animal market was done in order to prevent the spread of Sass-COV and Sass-COV-2.
To stop the re-responsible eruption of Mars, a vision of developing an effective vaccine against a Mars-COV for the camel, must be undertaken with the integration of the control plan of the other infection.
Because we cannot raise these viruses, new old types may arise to cause the eruption.
In wild animals, there are also various kinds of animal species that are also orbiting the Cowno.
Especially with animal potential, Bat COVs are also very varied.
There are countless opportunities for evolution and recombination in this animal COV, which will result in the future of a new COV of a more transitional and/or living form in humans.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, some places in China should be left behind the culture of eating wild animals.
In order of Sars, Mars, and Kovid-19, a good kind of preparation and response plan should be prepared.
Real, for a long time, many viruses have existed on the planet.
They live as long as they do not have the opportunity to spread in their own natural shelter.
Although there are many features of spreading viruses in the ventricle, if people are trained to keep away from venoming and other wild species, contact with humans can be reduced from them.
In order to better explain the life cycle of COV and their natural Posinde, there is a need for constant synthesis of mammals, which will be useful to prevent the mandrakes from being infected by animals and to prevent future eruptions.
To end, human beings are the most effective way to prevent animal poisoning from the conditions of the natural possion of the animal virus.
The countless pieces of animal origin of Sarss-COV-2 are still deep.
For the first time, if the ventriloquism contracts the excitation of sers-COV-2 into pangolins, it would be nice to see that the ventricles and pangolins correspond to the same perennial position in which conditions.
Second, if there are more direct roles in human circulation, humans will have to determine how they went into contact with the ventricle.
Third, if the third mammals are really employed as a mediator, it should be clear how they interact with different species including humans, ventrals, and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including pets, should be diagnosed with sars-COV-2 with the possibility of being sensitive, inconvenient, and experimental infections.
If it is venom, pangolins, or other mammals, in the future, it will be known exactly the same as the sers-COV-2 or their ancestor virus.
The evolution of sass-COV-2 in this area will divide the important diets in the prevention and control of covid-19 in humanity.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic assessment of COVID-19's of the 2nd-consuming case - and the 3rd-required case.
On February 6, 2020, our organization has published early advice guidelines for the diagnosis of the 2019 Novel Coronation (2019-nCOV), and these guidelines have made a good reference to the battle for our unsatisfactory and opposition to the association around the world.
However, the coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease.Our awareness and knowledge are gradually growing on the basis of the experience of the current research and medical practice, so the strategy for diagnosis and treatment is also constantly updated.
In this letter, a comment is raised on our guide element and according to the latest diagnosis and treatment provided by the COVID-19 (seventh edition) of COVID-19 (seventh edition) - the most common case cases - and the 3rd-required case. Its latest discovery of the assessment was provided by the People's Republic of China by the National Health Committee of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 Novel Corona virus (2019 -nCoV) was triggered by an official known as coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named Savier Aquare acuit syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, La WHO characterized COVID-19 as accompanying.
To fight against the infection of SARS-CoV-2, our organization has developed Drut advice guidelines and have been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since it has been published, they have had a great deal of attention.
Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, knowledge bringing us awareness is gradually growing on the basis of the research findings and medical practice that have started; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China(phttp://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published with a change of the total of seven references to COVID-19 published for COVID-19 between 16 January 2020 and March 2020.
Now our guide elements have received comments via Zou et al., they have presented simple quality proposals based on their medical experience.
Their work has added new evidence for our guide elements and also has a valuable reference for association around the world.
We page his significant work and thank us.
However, his work also needs to be updated according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guide elements of COVID-19 (cheating seventh edition) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of the suspected case requires any of the aitéms of the feature of the salogical history to be integrated with two ittems of the medical interest, or if there is no clear associational history, it is necessary to complete the three istemna of the Chichiselin inventor.
The accompanying history: (1) the city of Wuhan and its surrounding area, or the history of the cases where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded; (2) the history of contact with Kases with SARS-COV-2 infected cases; (3) Wuhhan and the surrounding community, or affiliated community where symptoms have been registered during the past 14 days before the appearance of symptoms were introduced by COVID-19, or the history of a patient in the region (4) known as the history of the KSwavID-19; the presence of cases (such as the home, the eighth part of the school, the school and the temperature of 2th century) of cases of cancer.
Chicksalien aggregation: (1) the symptoms of fever and/or respiratory; (2) with an imageic characteristic of the COVID-19 ear infection; (3) the total number of white cells in the early stages of the beginning, or showing the number of decreased lymphocytes.
The diagnosis of confirmed case is as follows: it should be on the basis of a suspected case with any element of disease or serologic evidence: (1) real time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be positive; (2) the known Novel coronausity should be a whole genetic order; (3) the toxicity that demonstrates high sensibilities to SARS-COV-2 for specific IgM antibodies and IgPine for positive; or SARSC-V2-V2-specific IGPind from a positive, to a positive, or a rapid phase of change in a positive phase.4.
We can see that the real time PCR test for the nucleic acid in the respiratory pathway or blood sample was added to the date of the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 24, 2020)
The disease identification of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth ( February 8, 2020); and later in the seventh edition, serological evidence was added.
These improvements are based on the regular work of researchers who have increased the availability of different samples, and are supported to bring positive effects of specific antibodies to certain antibodies in a confirmed assessment.
In addition, there was an extra evidence that reminded us to be cautious with the sampled symptom and suddenly rugna.
So, Zou et al. Its flowchart should be updated, because they are classified as a 10-cm risk to a person without a medical symptom.
The following medical practice and studies also require testing of the quality system.
To finish, we hope that more direct evidence will come to give their comments for the reader.
For the diagnosis of the corresponding case 3 and 3 of the cases mentioned, we should follow and follow the latest guidelines of his homeland.
Our organization will also update our guide elements at time to provide help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to Kovid-19, most of one day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to Kovid-19 in one day.
These viruses are the most deaths that have occurred throughout the day.
Meanwhile, infected cases reported by the Institute of Epidemiology of Bangladesh, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) contain 114 active Cases and 33 older cases that live at home.
All 17 deaths are recorded.
Given an online brief information, the director of the IEDCR, Doo, Mirjade Sabrina Flora, said that the dead consisted of four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Mirzade, two cases were between the age of 60, between two 51 and 60, and a 41-50 years old.
They also said that two of the victims were in the hole.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 as a saccompaniment.
Rugal officials reported to a local news Outlet, Adolu Agency, that one of the people who had died was the burning Safur Raman, manager of anti-Bangali corruption, who were treated in the kitchen as a friend in the kitchen.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladeshi road transport and bridge minister, Obadiah Quader said that public transportation would be closed for more than the initial planning, until this coming Saturday.
This public transport off would begin on March 26, and plan to end Saturday 4, April.
The transportation of living things--the transportation of medical, fuel, and amen- is still acceptable.
On 8 March, the first recorded Kovid-19 episode in Bangladesh, including two people who were returned from Italy and one of his wives.
On March 19, the three were already healed.
Sass-COV-2 has crossed a million infection around the world
On Thursday, John Haffkins University data has shown that the total number of cases worldwide of sers-COV-2 coronary infection has crossed one million cases.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to the disease caused by COVID-19, coronation.
The stone of the mill came the same day when Malawi confirmed the infection of his first coronation and the death associated with their coronation-.
North Korea, Thursday claimed that he was a country of some of the countries that remained free from the infection of coronary heart disease.
Until now, the World Health Organization, with the addition of 79,32 kesses in the previous 24 hours of the previous 24 hours of the previous 24 hours, confirmed the 11051,635 cases.
In the United States, if more than 244 thousand Korean cases were recorded, of which 5,900 were added to death.
CBS News, quoting John Hafkins University data, informed that the coronation of coronary disease caused more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. on Wednesday.
Worldwide, severe measures have been announced to prevent disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobianin, Mayor of Moscow, pushed Lockdown forward to 1 May.

Thailand has planned to apply communications restrictions from 10 to 4 a.m. at night.
Govner of Ohio, Mike Devain. has raised their house-run command to 1 May.
Stoersney in Australia reduced per behaviour to the death of the Toylate Paper.
On Sunday and Saturday evening. Australian store series Woolworths and Coles' prohibition on the purchase of his toylet paper reduced the sequences two above and per package to a national level as well.
ALDI also began a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limitations are posted as messages on checkout and Chen's Facebook page.
If people need self-isolation, the buyers are storing them again with fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Wolworths also made each purchase per order per pack so expensive.
These changes have been made after four-pack restriction of previous per behaviour presented by the Aicumus 4 and 5 March.
Colles, in the revelation of their 8th March, has reported that four-packs would be inhibited, others are selling within an hour of the store delivery. And said that the demand was untrustworthy.
According to the U.S. Declaration of the Wolworths, there was a 12-large increase in sales last week.
Costco's store in Canberra was also done in the past week with the amount of two packs as such.
To further reduce the break, Colles ordered a large package from suppliers and increased distribution frequency.Wolworths provided additional storage order, while ALDI made available quickly for scheduled Wednesdays.
The executive director of the Australian Reteller Association, Russell Zimmerma, said that Ritellerni tried to raise the stock, but it has been difficult due to the banning of the local council's truck-old time.
They have expected the growth in production costs, because suppliers have to demand, and have a lower amount of speciality to complete.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to sending early enough, some store can't run the specialty on Wednesday.
In News.com.au's report, Dr. Garry Mortimer, reteller researcher at Quinsalized University of Technology said that the store is filling up every night.
They beat the Shera that the toylate paper is a large iteme, which leads to a lower amount of sixty in the number, and, when sold, emptys the place of a large amount of shelf.
Colles and Wolworths view [key] If there are countless objects on the shelf, such as the Toylet Rolls and Sanitizers, and if there are more numbers, you will reduce the possibility of panic, according to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said.
The recycle toylate paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said that the deposit is over.
According to News.com.au's report, Kimberly-Clark, who prepares Kleenex Toilette Tissue, and Solaris Paper who produces Sorbant, emphasized that they are working 24/7 to keep the supply well.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that they reported that some property vendors in Melbourne are giving free toylate paper to the speaker who spoke the first speech on his livala, when the workers were having time for the big vicade of the day.
In the edition of the NT News's Thursday, printed every day in Darwin, as a Java used as chopped Java and toylate paper, eight water inserts were involved.
According to the report of ABC Australia's 3 March, the store was originally opposed to applying with restriction, in which they stated that they had no plan to impose any restriction on the purchase.
Russell Zimmerman stated that there is also a great demand for accreditation product which includes masks, satellites, dried objects, handwashs, and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening, British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andrews Toilet Pepper to two packs of 12-roll.
The World Health Organization announces that COVID-19 is a global association
The outbreak of COVID-19 by the World Health Organization on Wednesday (WHO) was announced as the disease- epidemic caused by the Corona virus.
Although it is not only relevant to how much a disease has spread over a particular event, despite the fact that WHO points out the need for solid action to be performed by governments.
All countries can still change the blockade of this global partner
If the nations recognized it as a response to this, the Tua tested, treated, split, demanded, and united its people in the fight, said Dentrous Adhanom Gebraissus, the Great Commissioner of WHO.
We are very concerned with both the spread of dangerous levels and the fearsome level of inactivity.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, the major head of the United States' Disease Control and Prevention Centers, it is globally with an unprecedented number of people.
In the comments released in CNN in February, they say, no other virus associated with respiratory without influenza has been taken from the emergence of the virus to global spread.
Ghebraetsus express the same view, with the global association that has arisen by Corona virus, we have never seen before.
He added, we haven't seen with a global, which can be controlled at the same time.
The present day of the world partner is WHO following the decision to announce this eruption as a public health investment of global concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fossie, head of the National Allergy and infectious disease institution of the United States, said about the emergence of the United States, “it is certain that this situation will be worse.
Up to Thursday, the Associated Press noted that COVID-19 has at least 1260,000 cases throughout the world, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
With the global side of the 2019-20 Corona virus, this Corona virus is a global association of 2019 (COVID-19) and is caused by the Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Having found that this eruption occurred in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, it has been announced in January 30, 2020 that it is a public health investment of global concern and has been recognized as a global association since 11 March 2020.
On April 10, 2020, COVID-19's 210 countries and provinces have reported approximately 1.61 million cases and, as a result, nearly 99,000 die.
Nearly 3640,000 people have been healed.
China has an estimated 4% of death rate in China, in the world he is in the category of Algeria 13.04% to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, skull, and stroke.
In the case of vandalism, there can be symptoms of pneumonia and respiratory complications.
The time from infection to symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be between two and fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific antidepressant treatments are known.
The primary treatment is to treat the symptoms and the basic form of treatment . Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth while digging, keeping away from other people, monitoring and treating yourself by individuals who are suspected of infection.
Officials around the world have responded by restricting travel, dividing, communications restrictions, controlling risks in the workplace, and preventing service-solving.
This global association has led to a global social-interested epidemic. Games, religious, political, and cultural programs have been pushed forward or cancelled and the widespread breaking of supplies items and has become dissatisfactioned by the purchase he was fearful.
In 193 countries, schools and colleges are closed on or locally, and its effect has been on approximately 99.4% of the world students.
The misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of fear or hatred and discrimination among people in the region that look like the Chinese, other East and Southeast tribes, and those of their kind, and of the virus.
Because of the decline in travel, and because of the blockade industry off, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
The health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of the U.S.) recorded the case of pneumonia due to an unknown cause in December 31, 2019, and was started with the trial at the beginning of January 2020.
The majority of cases were closely related to the Gulf market of Hunan's marine cuisine, and therefore it is believed to be the original species of this virus.
The virus that has caused this eruption is known as SARS-COV-2, a newly found virus, with the corona virus of its ventilators, closely related to the corona virus and SARS-CoV. The very first known person seen was later diagnosed on December 1, 2019 and did not have a direct relationship with the later wet market group.
In the early groups of cases recorded in 2019, two thirds of cases have been found to be associated with the market.
13 March 2020 In an unprofessionated report by the Morning Post of Southern China, it was suggested that by November 17, 2019, a 55-year-old man who was taken to the Hobby province could be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the registration of new cases in China had decreased but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, the first number of new cases outside China had grown to higher than the number of China.
The cases may have been recorded in a large amount of low form, especially in cases that have shown mild symptoms.
By February 26, there were relatively few cases recorded in young people, 19 or below the age of cases 2.4% of all cases around the world. The main medical advisor of the United Kingdom must be infected by 60% of the British population prior to the adoption of joint disease in the United Kingdom.
The context of the cases is about the number of people tested about COVID-19 and those who have been tested are sure to be positive according to the official rule.
By March 23, no countries had tested more than 3% of their population, and the official prohibition of such foreign countries as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland was that those with mild symptoms should not be tested.
According to a study released on March 16, China reported that approximately 86% of those infected with COVID-19 were not found and the unwritten individuals with this infection were infected infected by 79% of these written cases.
In a statistical analysis released on March 30, it has been estimated that the number of transitions in Italy was higher than the cases recorded.
The primary estimate of the basic recurrence number (R0) about COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
According to the study released by the US's Disease Control and Prevention Center, it has concluded that it could be 5.7.
The majority of people who have been COVID-19 are cured.
And the time from the appearance of symptoms in those who do not occur is between 6 to 41 days and 14 days normally with many.
By April 10, 2020, COVID-19 has nearly 99,000 died.
In China, 80% of the deadlocks were people over the age of 60, and 75% of those with chronic health problems have diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. COVID-19 The official figures of death caused by the epidemic usually have a relationship with such deadlines that the tests of COVID may have been positive, according to their official rule.
Indeed, deaths caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, because it may not include those who were not tested, for example, those who are dying at home, in the mornings of E. places.
A little information from Italy finds that the number of more deaths during the world partner was 4-5 times more than the official COVID death rate.
The U.S. Department of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adopted that, we know that [the number of deaths] is a small amount of debate. This is a statement which is confirmed by incomplete reports of the reduction of estimates in U.S.. The reduction of such method occurs often in the epidemic, as it was often accompanied by the 2009 H1N1 Swain Floo. The first confirmed death occurred on January 9, 2020.
Death outside of China's mainland was the first time in the Philippines to 1 February, and the first death outside of Asia had occurred in France on February 14.
By February 28, China's main country was all recorded outside, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
With the exception of Antarctica, deaths were recorded in more than forty countries and territories in all other volumes until 13 March. Several methods are commonly used to record the number of deaths.
These figures vary according to the region and time and the number of tests performed on them, the level of health care system, the options of treatment, the time and population since birth; for example age, gender, and total health. The quality of deaths in cases of death shows that the total deaths of deaths have been diagnosed.
According to Johns Hopkins University's statistics, on April 10, 2020, the majority of deaths and cases worldwide are 6.0% (97,033/1,617,204).
This number changes according to region.
Multiplyed 17.3% with death cases in China (1 to those with symptoms in January 10, 2020) decreased from 0.7% (in regard to those with symptoms after February 2020). Other methods include case death rate (CFR), which shows percentages of those who are infected with disease.
This figure does not have time bonding and it takes a specific population magova until it becomes a transition to the process.
Many educational institutions have tried to jeopardise these figures for a certain population.
The Center of Medicine, based on the evidence of the University of Oxford, estimates that the total transition of the global partner to death is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top side estimation in this category is consistent with the first memory method of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzes the impact of tests on CFR.
WHO is confident that this can be controlled with the global.
The highest level of this eruption and most of the time is uncertain and it can change according to location.
Massage Boni of Penn State University points out that 1 if not checked, the origin of the transition stops to rise at a level and when it is reduced by the host available to the disease.
But it is impossible for the present to make a proper estimate of this time.
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser Zong Nunshan has argued that if all countries start to follow the measures to prevent the spread of WHO's virus, it will end up until June 15th.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hajin and Tropical Medicine pointed out that SARS-CoV2 is likely to be spreading for one to two years.
According to the study led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, it will be expected to maintain physical distance and to maintain the purity of other measures until the end of the 20th month (which would take 18 months or longer).
William Shafner, of Vanderbilt University, points out that since the virus is so easily infected, it is impossible to destroy the whole because it is so easy to do so. Thus, it will become an infectious disease and will often return every year.
The toxicity or intensity of the return depends on the scope of the joint resistance and change.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are not comparatively specific and are not likely to be found in people who are infected.
The most similar two symptoms are fever (88%) and dry loss (68%).
Symptoms that are less detected include fatigue, breathing (kf) in the respiratory pathway, lack of smell, shock, sweating, headaches, cold breath, vomiting, vomiting, bleeding, excess or loss of life. WHO points out that one of the six is seriously ill and suffers from breathing.
U.S. disease control and prevention centres (CDC) have listed emergency symptoms; for example respiratory problems, long periods of chest pain or pressure, sudden constipation, loss of face or lips, and a loss of face or lips; if such symptoms are the result of rapid medical treatment; if the disease is further increased, there is a severe reduction in respiratory distress, severe susceptic shock, and death.
Since some of the infected may not have symptoms, there may be no medical symptoms, but the removal of tests will ensure infection, researchers have advised that those who have had a close contact with those who are convinced should be monitored frequently and tested to avoid the possibility of infection.
The Chinese argue that the majority of non-signals may be slightly to 44%.
When the virus enters the body, the time of the apparent disease (the time of the exposure to the symptoms) is between one and 14 days, usually it is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the number of people who lost the smell of smell-19 was 30% of the people who lost their sense of smell and then dropped it to 15%.
Some details about how this disease may have spread are still being explored.
The disease is thought to be spreading primarily by being closely connected and by small thaws created when digging or speaking, from nearby contact 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
During the study, it has been found that because the mouth is not covered, the thumbs (15 feet) can travel between 8.2 meters (27 feet) and about eight feet (5 m).
Some have assumed that the virus can also be transmitted from small throttles that come out of the mouth when speaking. Even if the virus is not produced in the air, the thumbs of the respiratory pathway can be prepared when breathing, speaking.
These thumbs can go into the mouth or nose of people who are close to them or are drawn into the lungs with the breath.
Medical procedures such as intubation or cardioplumnary resilience can lead to repeated deaths in the respiratory pathway and thus spread through the air.
If one touches a polluted surface, including skin, touches, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth, it can spread.
Although it is concerned that he can spread through the membrane, it is considered to be less dangerous.
The Chinese government has rejected the possibility of the infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the membrane or face-to-face. Although symptoms may appear and spread in the next three days of disease, it is most likely that this virus will be infected in the first three days after symptoms appear.
Three days before symptoms appear, people’s tests have been positive, and this indicates that it is possible to be infected even before the symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of cases that are not visible but confirmed in the laboratory, but some countries have discovered that even when searching for contact, there are no symptoms.
Although it is not entirely clear how easily this disease spreads, one person is infected with two to three people . It survives a few hours on the virus surface.
Typically, it has been found that the virus can be found on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stenles steel for three days, one day on the chest and four hours on the chest.
However, this can change according to humidity and temperature.The testing of pets and other animals COVID-19 has been positive.
Although British authorities, such as those infected with HIV, suggest washing their hands when they come in contact with other surfaces with which they are likely to be touched, there is no evidence that animals can infect the virus in humans.
The severe form serious respiratory disease coronary heart disease 2 (SARS-COV-2) is an unprecedented virus, separated from the three individuals with pneumonia that are associated with a group of severe form respiratory disease in the first Wuhan.
Novel SARS-CoV-2 all features are found in all related corona viruses that are in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies as its protective coat is dissolved by a domestic soap. SARS-CoV-2 is basically closely related to SARS CoV.
It is believed to have its original beings.
Genetic analysis has opened up that Corona virus forms a genetic group with the types produced from two ventricles with subgenus Serbians (lineage B).
Its entire genome level is about 96% simple with patterns of corona viruses associated with other ventricles (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers have found that there is only one amino acid difference in the toxicity of pesticides and some of the genomes between humans.
Today, in comparison to the entire genome, the virus of the miner and the SARS-CoV-2 find 92% of the genome content that is common in the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the miners are the same middle host.
On the basis of symptoms, it can be temporarily diagnosed with a virus infection but its confirmation was however by the reverse transcription Polymerase Chin Reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A comparative study of PCR and CT done in Wuhan has suggested that although CT is less accurate, it is significantly more sensitive than PCR and many of its iconic features are similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
March 2020 is recommended by the American College of Radiology that CT should not be used to diagnosis COVID-19 or should not be used as the first test.
SARS-COV-2 doing WHO has issued several rules of RNA testing, the first of which was issued on January 17.
This test uses real time reverse transcription polymerase Chen Reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on the respiratory or blood sample.
The extracts can usually be made available for a few hours in a few days.
This test is usually taken with the pattern of the swat in the upper part of the nose but also the pattern of the breath can be used.More laboratory and companies are developing tests that identify blood-related resistors.
By April 6, 2020, there was not enough accurate proof to approve any of these tests for widespread use.
A test regarding a blood-related blood developed in the U.S. has been approved for the use of icdy from standard laboratory only.
The specific image features on radiographs and compact tomography (CT) of people who do not have symptoms include unaffiliated peripheral glands opocities and do not have plyral affinity.
International online information of the findings of images of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Redeological Society.
Combined with infections such as Adinovirus because it is less accurate to use images in finding COVID-19 without confirmation of PCR.
A large study in China compared the chest CT extracts to PCR, and it was shown that images were less accurate to detect infections, although they were fast and more sensitive and indicated that this partner's disease should be considered to be a means of testing.
Convolutional neural networks have been developed with radiographs and CT based on artificial intelligence to detect image features.
Plans to prevent infection of this disease include keeping our entire personal health well, washing our hands, not washing hands, preventing hands from touching the nose or mouth, using tissue while scratching or sinking, and putting the tissue directly into the trash.
Those who have already been infected have been advised to wear surgical faces in public places.
The measures of maintaining physical distance to prevent infection are but recommended.A lot of governments have limited travel or advised not to travel to other parts from areas where the eruption has occurred.
However, the virus has reached the level of social spread in larger parts of the world.
This means that the virus has begun to spread into society and some elements of society do not know when and where they have been infected. It is recommended that people who are caring for an infected person be concerned according to standard, care regarding contact, and care about the eyes. Managing people who have come in contact is an important way to find the origin of health officials and avoid further transitions.
Using information about the place through mobile phones has generated concern about private life and has issued a request for limits on such adherence by the amnesy International and other 100 institutions.
Many mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for a commercial use, and by April 7, 2020, groups of more experts than dozen were working on options such as using Bluetooth to log with other cellphones.
Then a message comes when users get in touch with someone whose COVID-19 test has been positive.The misconceptions about preventing infection are spreading, for example it is not effective to clean the nose and fold.
There is no vaccine available for COVID-19, many organizations are trying to develop lesions.
It is recommended to wash your hands in order to prevent disease spread.
CDC has recommended that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially when they go to toilets or if they see their hands milling, before eating and cooking the nose, wash their hands when they are washed or sprinkled.
This is because outside of the human body, the virus dies with a domestic soap because the domestic soap breaks its protector's vest.
If water and soap are not available, CDC still recommends that at least 60% of alcohol alcohol should be used by a alcohol based sanitizer.
WHO recommends not touching eyes, nose, or mouth without touching hands.
62-71% ethaneol, 50-100% isoperpenol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% of the fluids such as Povidone-Iodin can be eliminated from surface contamination (the surface of Stenles steel can only be destabilized using a minute junction).
Other dams, such as benzalconium and Crohexidine, are less effective.
CDC has recommended that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a place such as a COVID or a pet, all of the tablets in such a section should be destabilized like the ATM machine used by the Tch screen, remote control and sick individuals.
Health organizations have recommended people to cover their mouth and nose with a dim coat or tissue when digging or cooking, and should immediately vibrate the tissue.
Surgical faces have been recommended for those who are susceptible to infection, because they can be limited by the amount and distance of the thumbs that spread through the mouth when speaking, sewing, or digging.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to the University of Leeds' virus scientist Stephen Griffin, it is likely to reduce the tendency of people to put their faces on the face that if the health of the hand is not appropriate, there is a great source of infection for those who care for those who are likely to have this disease but have been recommended for the mouthpiece.
WHO recommends using faces only if they are at risk for healthy people, such as those who are infected with COVID-19, they also recognize that wearing faces can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have begun to encourage people in general to use faces.
CDC recommends the use of unilateral masks made from clothing in the U.S., especially when it comes to the use of medical mentors that can be placed on the diluted by China, especially for those who have access to health services in the public, especially for those who have access to other people (1 meters (3 feet) or less.
Hong Kong has recommended use of surgical faces when using the public transportation system or while in the neck.
Thailand's health officials are encouraging people to make clothes masks for faces at home and wash them daily.
Zek Republic and Slovakia are forbidden to go out without wearing face in public places or without covering their nose and mouth.
March 16, Vietnam requests everyone to wear faces when they go to public places, so that they will protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandatory to put faces on the face as they go to the rental goods store.
Israel has told all residents to face face face in public places.
From the middle of Taiwan March, ten million faces have been made daily, and since April 1 passengers have been obliged to wear face-to-faces in trains and intercity buses.
The Panamanian has been forced to wear faces on the face as they go out, and it is recommended that those who are unable to buy faces for the face be made face-to-face at home.
Mouths to wear on faces are also used in Muggles in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Maintaining social distance (also called physical space) involves actions to control infection which are intended to reduce the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include separation, travel bonds, and blocking schools, places of work, fields, theaters, or purchase centers.
Social space is the means by which people can live at home, by limit their travel, by avoiding their surroundings, by contacting others, and by applying the physical distance from others.
Many governments have ordered or recommended to keep social distances in the region where the eruption has occurred.
U.S. government agencies and health departments met with a higher number of people from 250 people (if the spread of COVID-19 in that province was not known) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany has banned the gathering of more than two people in public places. In places of social origin, older people and those with medical restrictions such as diabetes, heart disorder, government disorders, high blood pressure and adhesive resistance system are advised to stay at home as they face the growing risk of serious illness and disorder. In the late March 2020, as of maintaining social relations, WHO and other health agencies have used the term of reducing interval.
The use of the term \"social interval\" had been the result of the use of the term that people would be completely separated from one another in alternative ways rather than encourage socially interacting with each other. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines between this world partner.
In this, there are recommendations for having sex with someone you live with and the person who has not infected this virus or who has no symptoms of virus.
In cases where COVID-19 has been diagnosed and those who doubt that we have been infected have recommended to take their own separation into the home.
Health organizations have given proper instructions on how to self-regulated. Many governments have ordered or recommended the separation of the entire population living in the area in which they have been infected.
For those in groups with greater risk, the most strict form self-vilogation instructions are given.
Those who are likely to come in contact with the COVID-19 bounded person and who have recently traveled to a country or region that has recently been infected in the scope have suggested self-vilogation for 14 days since they came in contact.
Restricting or preventing spread and spreading is the only remedy on controlling the eruption.
Restricting the spread is done at the early stage of the eruption and its purpose is to take the magows of those who have infected, disorganized them, likewise to plan a solution that controls the infection and to prevent the spread of disease in other populations.
When it is not possible to inhibit the spread of disease, steps are put in the direction of slumping the disease: measures are made to reduce the spread speed and measures to reduce its impact on the health system and society.
Both measures can be combined to inhibit spread and reduce spread.
In order to prevent spread, there must be more end measures to reverse and reduce the global partner's disease by reducing the number of fundamental resilience by reducing the number of exposures to the spread of the disease . As part of the diagnosis of infectious disease, they try to reduce the severity of spreading which is called flatization of the article of spread.
These reduce the risk of stress on health services and provide time for developing vaccines and treatment.
Unusual concerns that could manage the eruption include personal preventive measures such as cleaning the hands, wearing faces and self-driving, blocking school programs, encouraging the community to acknowledge such interventions as a large number of people coming together, and meeting them with the objective of physical space cleaning the surfaces associated with the surrounding environment. When China saw the severity of the eruption, it became more severe actions such as disorganizing the entire city and putting more strict limits on travel.
Other countries have also organized various measures to limit the spread of virus.
South Korea has begun largely to test and divide locally and warn against the movements of infected people.
Singapore helped economic aid to those who were separated from themselves and those who could not do so were punished.
Taiwan increased the production of mouthpieces for facial use and punished when storing medical items.If you follow the Great Britain and the United Nations, there are major challenges in reducing the spread of disease (not stopping, stopping the spread of diabetes) and preventing (inverting the growth of partner's disease).
Custom planning to reduce disease epidemics can reduce the high demand for health care by 2/3 and death can be half-term but still can lead to thousands of deaths and massive stress on health systems.
It may be a priority to prevent or press the spread but as long as the virus is transmitted into the human community (or lass until it becomes available, if it happens earlier) it needs to continue to maintain the transition after the solution is set.
Over time interventions can cause economic and social harm by preventing or suppressing the spread of a partner's disease.
There are no specific virus prevention standard drugs for COVID-19 but there are attempts to develop it that have the potential to take the tests of the drugs available.
Taking a cold drug that is easy to obtain at medical stores, drinking liquid and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Animal therapy, giving liquids from the Shire, and the need to help the breath can be as strong as the need to be treated.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Many such compounds that have been approved before treating other toxic diseases are being researched to treat COVID-19.
WHO has also stated that traditional and domestic therapy can provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Increased capacity and optimizing health services for patients with COVID-19 have been reported to be a basic solution to respond to eruptions.
The European Department office of ECDC and WHO have provided guidelines for carrying the resources available for hospitals and primary health care services on various levels including focusing on laboratory services for tests of COVID-19, eliminating alternative methods if possible, separating patients who have received COVID-19 testing by separating and training staff and increasing the number of vintilitars and beds available, etc.

Some Chinese officials, such as Zao Ligian, refused to say that the early Corona virus occurred from the Wuhhan with the theory of the carspace that began with the introduction of COVID-19 from US or Italy.
Donald Trump, the US administration of the Donald Trump, has referred to the Corona virus as a 7chinian virus, or a vehan virus, and has said that China's 3gopability has made a virus so powerful that it has been transformed into a global partner.
The Daily Beast received a date of US government which contained a currency message of Clupti's currency of fraud to the enemy whose origins were in the National Security Council and in which plans were all about China.
We are being told that try and open this message out of the journalistic council and the presence of television in any way. Media such as Politico ,Foren Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that the attempt to send help to the poisoned part of China is an attempt to preach for a global dominance.
Joseph Bourel, the chief of EU Foreign Protection, warned that by turning a round and the policy of compassion, it is the grounding element that includes the lesson of dominance.
Borell also stated that China is offensively sending messages that he is rather responsible and trusted than US.
China has claimed that US has sent aid to Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and has also sent aid to Venezuela and Iran.

Political analysts estimated that these Donald Trump would have had a negative effect on the ferinizing of the 1920s' presidential election.The global association of the disease led to the collapse of Japan and South Korea's critical relations.
South Korea criticized Japan's anti-vilogation inconsequential and passive effort when Japan declared that everyone coming from South Korea would be separated for two weeks at a designated location.
The South Korean community was initially polarized or isolated about the response of President Mun Jee-Ein's crisis.
Many Koreans co-operated laws in the state of the state to run the continents or to praise Mun because of their husband's efforts by the government to handle the Muun. This global partner's disease allows the country to respond to the laws of the state.

The outbreak of the corona virus has been blamed for several incidents including the fragmentation of supply items, which are generated by the increased use of devices facing a global scale eruption, the fearsome purchases, and the factory and transportation investment.
The United States Food and Drug Administration warned that by increasing the demand for consumers, and by investing to suppliers, drug and medical content had been broken down.
In many parts, fear was seen as a result of the purchase, and as a result, the shop’s fruits destroyed the items used in food, toilets, and bottled water, and thus broken up the supply items.
mainstream technology industries have been warned about the delay in sending electronic items.
According to the W.H.O. manager Tedros Adnam, the demand for personal protection devices has increased 100 times.
As a result of this increased demand, prices have grown to twenty-five times of the usual price, and four to six weeks of delay in supply of medical items.
As a result, personal protection devices have also been broken across the world, and therefore the WHO has warned that this would threaten health employees.
In Australia, the companion of this global disease has given Daigu shoppers the new opportunity to sell Australian items to China.
This action resulted in a break in some super market of baby formulas and then the Australian government blocked it. While there are more cases in North Italy and in the Wuhhan area, and even when there are more demand for food, both parts have survived from the severe breaking of food.
China and Italy's reserves and measures have been successful against illegal trade of things, and therefore the severe breaking of food items that were expected to be in Europe and North America was avoided.
Since agriculture production was more abundant in northern Italy, it has not experienced much decline but can increase prices in accordance with the representatives of industries.
It was also only temporary in Wuhan to have the fruit of food in the store, while the Chinese officials opened the store for enough nutrition of the population of the pigs.
Italy also has similar laws, so food producers have to keep food reserves for such investments.
The damage to the global economy is starting to be felt in China, according to a media report on a March 16, the first two months of China's economy, the Chinese government has had a very serious impact in preventing the spread of virus, and the rental sales have decreased by 20.5%.

The red arts and cultural traditions of the presentation have had a profound impact on these areas and on organizations and individuals - both those with jobs and those not.
Organizations in the arts and culture field tried to keep their campaign (many publicly held) which included having opportunities for society to experience cultural traditions, protecting their employees in public places and helping artists when possible.
By March 2020, the whole world had a total amount of reserves, archives, locations of sediment, and other cultural institutions were closed for uncertain time and their exhibits, activities and presentations were abolished or pushed forward.
As a response to this, there was a strong effort to provide alternative services from the medium of digital occupation. The disease still causes a slow drop of religious service, the main program in the game, and other musical concerts, such as the technical council and fashion show, to cancel the social program.

Sweating cancer Virus disease 2019 (Covid - 19) and related sars-kovi-2 viruses include methods that detect the presence of viruses in laboratory tests and detect antidepressants in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the test ensures by RT-PCR, which detects RNA of cancer viruses.
This test is specific and it is designed only to detect RNA of sars-covy-2 virus.
It is used to ensure a fairly recent or active infection.
Testing of antibiotics (cerology) can be used for both the diagnosis and frequent attention to the population.
The test of antibiotics shows how many people had disease, including people with very rare symptoms or people with no symptoms to specify.
From the results of this test, the correct death rate of the disease and the level of resistance of the group in the population can be determined.
Due to limited tests, by March 2020, the country did not have reliable information about the spread of viruses in their population.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of their population, and there is a great deal of benefit to the extent that it had been tested between countries.
This changeability is also likely to significantly affect the case of the death rate recorded, which is also likely to be largely unreal in some countries.
Real-time reverses transcription Polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be tested on the samples of the respiratory acquired by various methods, including a sample of the Nazopheraangian Swab or Thunki.
The results are usually available for a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PR test in the throat is confirmed only during the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat, and its number in the lungs continues to increase rapidly.
As an option at that time as an alternative to testing people infected in the second week, the Section can either be taken from the deep airway or the component (a little) after the missing.
One of the early PCR tests at Cherry in Berlin in January 2020 had been used using real-time reverse transcription Polymer Chin response (RRT-PCR) and was a foundational component of 2500,000 test sets available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England had also developed tests by January 23, 2020. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean Company Kogenebiotec developed a set of clinical grades, PCR-based sars-covy-2 discovered (powercheck coronavirus).
The test was all based on the Beta Corona virus. The RdRp detects genes specific to both the gene and SARS-CoV-2. In China, for a set of PR-based SARS-CoV-2, the National Medical Products obtained approval for emergency use from the administration of China was one of the first companies. The U.S. Department of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been distributed by the International Resonators (1919-NCV) Centre for the Real Reservation of the RT-DC-DC-Dyging System.
One of the three of the older versions of the test sets was due to the random results due to random results and interfered with tests at CDC in Atlanta; the result was that every day, on average, less than 100 samples, was successfully processed throughout February 2020.
By February 28, 2020, tests used by two components were not considered valid, and until then state-based and local laboratorys were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration within the Emergency Use Officials . The U.S. professional experiments began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Lab Corp advertises the availability of covid-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
Similarly, on March 9, 2020, the Quest Diagnostics provided a covid-19 test across the country.
No limits were declared on the scale; the sample collection and processing should be done only according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, Virology and biotechnology state research center vectors had developed and created covid-19 tests.
The test was recorded by the Federal Service to keep an eye on health service on 11 February 2020. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic had a record of developing tests to detect the Kovid-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roshe Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for a test that could be performed in a large amount of 3.5 hours, thus allowing a machine to test an estimated 4,128.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA gave Abot Laboratory the emergency use official (EIA) to test Abbott's M2000 system; the FDA had given such authorization before the Holocaust, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Sefide received the EU for a test from the FDA in a similar way for approximately 45 minutes from the FDA.
The FDA approved such a test that uses esothermal nucleic acid animation technology instead of PCR.
Since this is not needed for a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can also give a fixed extract in less than five minutes and negative effects at 13 minutes.
Currently there are approximately 18,000 such machines in the United States and Abbott is expected to increase the product as many as 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses monoclonal antibiotics that binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protin) of the Novell Corona virus in particular, it is expected that this test will be developed in Taiwan, as it were the rapid influenza test in 15 to 20 minutes.
In March 2020, it was concluded that the umbrella X-rays are less useful for diagnosis in the early stages, while the conclusions of CT [computed tomography] may be present before the symptoms begin.
The certain features of CT include the goon contrast side distribution with bilateral multilayer grand-glass opification.
As the disease begins to grow, subplural domines, Krezi Pewing and Combination develop.
Comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan at the root of the current partner has suggested that CT with its many imaging features include other pneumonia and disease processes, although it is less characteristically more sensitive than the PCR.
On March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that the CT should not be used as a first-time test to investigate or verify the quavid-19.CT recommends the CDC PCR for initial examination by March 2020.
As part of the immune response to infection, antibiotics with IGM and IGG are produced.
Those tests can be used to locate infections after 7 days or some time after the beginning of symptoms.These tests can be examined by the central laboratory (CLT) or by point of peer testing (POCT).
Many clinical laboratorys will be able to examine these large-scale automated systems designed by doing some processing during a certain period of time but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
Although many models can be used to manipulate the immune response, a single pattern of peripheral blood for CLT is commonly used.
A single sample of blood is obtained through the skin pumps in general for the POCT.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for extrusion prior to the investigation . The FDA announced 29 elements that gave the agency instructions as needed and that is why they are capable of distributing their antidepressants tests.
By April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one test. At the end of March 2020, the Euroimun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitom Diagnostics were approved by European Saddya for their tests sets of blood samples, which can be found by the IG and IGA antibiotics on the background of viruses in the blood sample.
The ability to test is something that hundreds of samples can be examined for hours, and that is why this test is faster than the traditional PCR checking of viruses RNA.
It is generally possible to find antidepressants in 14 days after infection. England at the beginning of April did not find enough adequate to use any set of antidepressants they bought.
Hong Kong has planned that, in which suspected patients can live at home, -- the emergency department will give the patient a sample tub. They spit in it, send it back, and receive a test at some time. The British NHS has reported that they are doing an early study of the plan to test the suspects at home, by which they come to the hospital to avoid the danger of infection to others or to prevent them from using an ambulance. For suspected suspects, the COV-19DDD test, the health expert will be able to monitor it with the health news.
The drive thru centers have helped South Korea to test the fastest, very-wise than any country. In Germany, 2 March, the National Association of Stachutary Health Insurance Fishers rendered that they had the ability to test approximately 12,000 per day in the rotating system and that 10.700 people had been tested in the past week.
As soon as you are asked to test from a doctor, it is costed by health insurance.
According to the presidents of Robert Koch, Germany has the ability to test 160,000 a week.
By March 19, drive in tests had been offered in many large cities.
By March 26, 2020, the total number of tests made in Germany did not know, because only positive leaks had been recorded.
The first survey in the laboratory found that by the week 12/2020 of the calendar and 12/2020 with the week, the total at least 483,295 samples were checked and 33,491 samples (6.9%) came positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambum Hospital developed methods for examining 64 patients at the same time, and used only the following tests if all the models were found together and found positive. 5 February 2020, by the BYII-O-O-O-O-O-A (in-IF) could be found in the U.S.R.A.A., more than 10,000 per-day use of the program was performed on the program.
The founder of BBI was built in 5 days under the supervision of Wang Jian and this modeling has shown that this test capacity would not have been started at time, but 47% more cases would have been seen in Hubei and the related cost of handling Quartaine would have been doubled.
The old laboratory has been closely followed by Huo-Yan experiments in a total of 12 cities in China such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai.
By 4 March 2020, there were 50,000 tests per day. The open source, published by the Origami Sage, can only be checked for covid-19 of the samples of 1122 so many patients using a multiplex design. These balance designs can be used in small laboratory without robotic Liquid Hasadler.
By March, it has been a barrier to the breaking and insufficient amount of revenue for large scale tests in the Eu, UK, and US.
This led some authors to release the RNA genome for further testing. (208 degrees Fahrenheit) started to see the sample preparation protocol that included heating for 5 minutes. 31 March was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now testing the human population for more than any other country in its population and that the test level was on its way to reach the population of the larger scale.
This was from the combination of the purchase of the Ghawk thrupt Laboratory from the driver thru capacity and Group 42 and BBI (on the basis of their /huo-Yan in China - emergency research experiments).
built in 14 days, this laboratory is able to test thousands of RT-PCRs per day, and is the first in the world with so large affiliates outside of China.
In China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States, various operations of testing targeting various parts of the Corona virus genetic profile were developed.
The World Health Organization adopted Germany's action to send a set of creations to countries that do not have resources to create their own sets.
Germany's action was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Disease Control Center was not available until January 28, which led to a flood of available tests in the United States. China and the United States in the early years had problems with the reliability of testing sets of tests and these could not provide sufficient sets to meet the test recommendations from the country and Australia, demand and health experts.
In contrast, as there was a large amount of tests available in South Korea, Novell Corona helped reduce the spread of viruses.
A large scale test capacity in the private sector was created by the administration of South Korea over many years.
On March 16th, the World Health Organization ordered the testing program to be raised as the best way to reduce the spread of covid-19 partners . As a result of the widespread demand for testing in large quantities of toxicity, there were hundreds of tests in the U.S. private laboratorys in the U.S., and a lack of supply of Swab and chemical suppliers.
In March 2020, China recorded problems regarding the accuracy of their test sets.
The test set developed by CDC in the United States had 3 faults; the government then removed the barriers of servanthood which inhibited private testing. Spain bought test sets from the Chinese company of Shenzhen BioEiology. Limited, but found it to be wrong.
The company explained that the failure to use the sample collected or set of sets in a proper manner may have led to a misdemeanor.
The Ministry of Spain said that they would return the set of mis-deleted and instead give a separate test set provided by Shenzene Bioisi. The Czech Republic mis-determined the 80% of the test sets purchased by China. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test sets from China that found corruption.
The set was suggested by Prime Minister Matowick to be put in Danube. Ates Kara, the Ministry of Turkish Health, said that the Turkish bought from China had a large amount of 5 cups. And they didn't. The UK bought 35 million test sets from China but announced that they were not usable at the beginning of April 2020.
Test, then the disparity of patients who came positive in the test and the magova of people who came in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positives, brought good results.
In Italy, where Kovid-19 died, researchers working in this city of Italy, estimated to be 3,400 over the entire population, made two rounds of tests with an estimated ten-day difference.
The average half of the people who came to the Possitive had no symptoms and were separated by those found.
By limiting community travel to life, new infections completely broke out.
Taking the offensive magova of contact, with restrictions on internal travel, tests, and disparities, the spread of the association of the Coronavirus in Singapore has been much more at hand than other developed countries and did not have to restrict the tip such as blocking the establishments of subsidies and rental sales.
Many programs have been cancelled and Singapore had begun to advise citizens to stay at home since March 28, but reopened the school on 23 March after the time of the holiday.
The contact is offensively taking magova, through bans, tests and separations on travel across the country, but many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have managed this partner.
In statistical studies it has been found that countries where more and more tests compared to death count, the death rate is quite low because often these countries have only been discovered by individuals with no mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization has recommended that countries that do not have the ability to test and that national laboratorys have a limited experience about Kovid-19 they should send their first five positive and the first ten negative models to test confirmation in one of the 16 experiments referred to by the World Health Organization.
Of the 16 cited experiments, 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
% positives of the 3s of the table below are influenced by the policy of the country testing on the record.
While other matters are similar, even if the symptoms were seen or not seen, compared to the country that tests all citizens, the country tests only those who are admitted to the hospital will have more % positives there.
Washing hands (or washing hands), also called hand cleaning, is the act of washing one's hands for the purpose of removing soils, deserts, tiny organisms, or other non-smoking items.
During the day, at a few or all of the minutes that I’ve had to wash my hands constantly, I’ll feel the spread of many diseases, such as excessive and frequent, spread of my hand to my mouth.
People can also be infected with diseases such as influenza or serdi, for example if they have not washed their eyes, nose, or hands before touching their mouth (i.e., Schleishm skin).
Five important times in the day, which is important to wash your hands with soap: before going to the toilet and then, after the baby's crust has been cleaned or langoat changed, before feeding the baby, before cooking, and after cooking the food, and after or after or after handling raw meat, fish or birds in the pool.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed by holding hands, the World Health Organization recommends washing your hands at the following time:
Before cooking, cook, and then.
Before and after taking care of the sick person.
After changing the Lungot or washing the stone of the child who went to the condolences.
When the nose is smothered, after scratching, or sinking.
After touching the animal, the food of the animal, or the animal's trunk.
Cleanliness of medical hands is the habit of cleanliness associated with medical processes.
If you wash your hands before giving a drug or before taking medical care, you may be reluctant to spread the disease or at least reduce it.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse hands from diseases (living organisms, viruses, or other tiny organisms that cause disease) and can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in a medical field, but also for the general public.
There are many health benefits to wash hands, including lowering the spread of influenza, coronary virus and other infectious diseases; inhibiting overcrowding infectious causes; reducing respiratory infections regarding breathing;
And home deliverys include reducing the rate of child mortality.
A 2013 study has shown that improved hand washing techniques can lead to kidney improvements in heights of less than five years of children.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates associated with respiratory and hypertensive diseases can be reduced by beginning with simple changes in behavior such as hand washing.
This simple act can lead to a nearly 50% reduction in mortality caused by these diseases.
The interventions that encourage washing hands can reduce oversaw events by an estimated one third and compare it to providing pure water in a lower income section.
The 48% decrease in the extreme event can be related to washing your hands with soap . The action of washing your hands with a soap done in homes, schools, and communities around the world is the only very effective and independent way to prevent excessive and severe respiratory infection (ARI).
pneumonia, with major ARI, is a major cause of death among children under five years of age, causing approximately 18 million children to die annually.
With extreme and pneumonia, approximately 35 million children die each year.
According to UNICEF, more lives can be saved than any vaccine or medical intervention, before eating and going to toilet, and after a soapy habit of washing your hands, the deaths caused by extremes are almost half the deaths and the deaths caused by severe respiratory infections result in a loss of one-choice.
It is usually combined with hand washing as part of water, hygiene and health programs (wash) programs.
It is also protected by washing hands from the firepita, which is directly spread through physical contact.
A small disadvantage of washing your hands is that constantly washing your hands can cause skin drying and skin damage.
A study in Denmark, which has been done in 2012, found that eating hands too much can create a state of skin such as eating hands, releasing her papayas, which is called the Isb or Skin disease of the hand, which is particularly common in health service workers.
It is also considered a symptom of the idea-action mandatory disorder (OCD).
There are five important times throughout the day when my hand is important to reduce the spread of illness by soap to my mouth: when you go to Bathroom (laugh, hobby), when the baby's crust is cleaned (after changing the milk), before feeding, and after feeding and after cooking, or after raw meat, fish or poultry or after handling a petri class bird.
In other cases, when the proper system of washing should be applied to the spread of the disease should include the following, before treating either cut or other injury; after rinseing, scratching, or nailing; after touching the animal's arm or after touching the animal's arm and touching the skull.
In many countries, there is a decrease in the amount of washing your hands with soap.
A study in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of the hands are washed by soap in homes. A 2014 study showed that the highest rate of washing hands in Saudi Arabia is 95 percent, about 77 percent in the United States, and the lowest 23 percent in China. Some practices that change in behavior are now taking place are now taking place in critical times of washing hands. For children in developing countries, washing is the preferred option for children to wash their hands in certain times of washing.
An unilateral health service program conducted by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the measurement of action for children's health and education.
It is the root part of the national program by destroying the joints twice a year, at the same time washing your hands with soap every day, by Florida.
This has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removing small olives from the skin was enhanced by the use of soap or detergent with water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce the restriction of waste and increase obesity.
Only water is insufficient to clean the skin because fat and proteins with organic soil components are not quickly dissolved in water.
However, purification is done through the proper flow of water ..
Due to the nature of our revascular nature, the dense soap is likely to be organisms due to previous uses.
Some studies about the migration of living organisms through infected dense soap concluded that their migration is not possible due to the death of the gas.
CDCs still say that the liquid soap that doesn't touch the hand for the turnup is credited.
Antibiotic soap has been strongly promoted among people who are aware of health benefits.
Until today's date, there is no amount of a recommended antiseptic or juvenile use for the immune-representation in nature.
However, antimicrobial soaps have common antidepressants such as trichlosan, with a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.
This is why, although antibiotic stress resistance for organic soaps has not been selected, it cannot be as effective as stated.
Additionally, acid (ascitic acid ascorbic acid, lactic acid), disease resistance can be active benzoic acid and other skin condishners (coorfed, vitamins, menthol, plant arcs). The widespread analysis of the University of the Oregon School of Public Health suggests that normal soaps are also used to prevent diseases like the trachloric acid, and the hands are effective by inhibiting the liver.
It is not enough for such warm water to beat the joints so comfortable to wash your hands.
In body temperature, the joints grow rapidly (37 decree C).
However, tender water is more effective than cold water of soap when removing natural oil from the hands of clay and barley.
However, against popular belief, scientific studies have shown that commut water from hands is not effective in reducing microbial load.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic water is a hand cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand cleaning agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubber, antiseptic hand rubber or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most of its isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulaation with a tryining agent such as carbomer (the polymer of the ecrelic acid) in a gel form or in an oser fluid form such as glycerin, or easy to use and reduce the effect of alcohol's dryness.
The mild hydrogen-peroxide increases the immune function. At least 60 to 90 percent of the alcohol effective joints in hand sanitizers are destructive.
Alkohl rubber sanitizer arthritis, multi-born resistant arthritis (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some pathogens (including HIV, Harpies, RSV, Rhinauerus, Vaxiania, Influenza, and Hepatitis) and beats
Alkohl rubber Sanitizer has 70% alcohol and after it is laid, 99.97% on hands in 30 seconds (3.5 log cup which is equivalent to 35 decibel cup) and beats from 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 log cups) after 1 minute of the jade. Hand Sanitizer is very effective on some joints and is less effective on some patients.
Alcohol based hand sanitizer is fully unaffected against pathogens such as Noroviers (or Norwalk), which is the most common cause of Conkramac Gestroenteritis. A lot of hand antiseptic or alcohol rubber should be used to clean both hands completely.
The next and backward parts of both hands, and the place between all fingers, should be grassed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, face, or jail.
The fingers should also wash clean, and they should be gadgeted on both floors. US Center for Disease Control and Preversion recommends that hand sanitizers should fall on hands after washing.
Simple use and speeds increase in use of these agents on the basis of the action of hitting micro-livings; however, they should not work as a substitute for washing hands properly if soap and water are not available.
As alcohol-based sanitizer can dry the skin with frequent use of the sanitizer, it should put the skin softer ingredients and/or mossierizers in it.
In this formula, glycerin and/or other skin softer material can be reduced or finished with the effect of drying alcohol.
Alcohol -based hands sanitizers with amolient tests reduce skin burn and dryness rather than soap or antioxidants.
An allergic contact is rarely found in skin disease, excessive sensitivity to the syndrome of contact Pitashia or alcohol, or the substance present in hand rubbers.
The following tendency was attracted to the disease by soap and water, compared to washing your hands.
Despite their effectiveness, Non Water Agents does not clean the hands of central material, but only their exodus.
To prevent the spread of diseases for the same reason, hands are not as effective as sanitizer soap and water because the pathogens live on their own hands.
The efficiency of alcohol-free bone sanitizers depends on very large amounts of components and formats and historically back to a significant amount of alcohol and alcohol rubber.
Recently, in the formulation that uses benzalconium chloride has been shown to have continuous and stored antidepressant antidepressants, opposite of alcohol, where performance decreased after repeated use, may be due to the reaction of progressive antiviral skin.
Many of the low income groups don't turn around soap and use it to keep and soil.
Keep and soil can be more effective than just water but is less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, the spread of disease will increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, soil is also a organic because when soil comes in contact with water, a alkaline is formed.
When the soap is not available, it has recommended WHO to use it as an alternative to keep or radii.
The exact system of washing hands recommended by the American Disease Control Center to prevent the spread of disease consists of the following steps:
Pour your hands with tender or hail flowing water.
Flowing water is recommended because permanent bases can be contaminated, and it appeared that water temperature did not make much difference.
Put a large amount of soap on your hands, place it on your back of your hands, and place it under your fingers, and make it your fees.
The soap has been removed from the skin, and studies have shown that when soap is used to wash your hands, people wash their hands in a more orderly manner.
Wash your hands at least 20 seconds.
It causes friction, which causes the skin to go away, and more joints are removed from the skin because it is too late.
Wash your hands clean under the running water.
Washing your hands in the besin can cause your hands to become contaminated again.
Wash your hands with clean rumala or let the air dry.
Ole and Olser hands are contaminated soon again. The thumbs, mangoats, parts of the fingers, and the lower parts of the nails are parts that are normally removed to wash the hands.
In fact, some scientists believe that the human brain is the most powerful force in the universe.
To prevent hands from drying, it is highly recommended for moicturizing lousion; dry skin can damage the skin that can lead to an increase in the risk of infection.
A variety of low cost options can be made for the ease of washing hands in a place where coconut water and /or soap are not available, e.g. if necessary in a developing country, pour water and /or keep water from the Haging Gericcan, or from the spring with proper holes. Under limited water supply conditions (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), 3 tops - and other low cost alternatives such as water - are options for adjustment.
The tipi tap is a simple technique that has a can hanger with the help of a rope to pour a little water on the hand and the soap, and a lever that can be moved with the foot.
Effectively drying hands is an essential part of the cleaning process, but there is a little debate about the most effective type of drying in public toilets.
The increased amount of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand drawer that is in the rest of the kitchen.
A study was conducted in 2008 by WestMinster University London to compare the level of cleaning provided by paper towels, hot air use hand drivers, and modern jet-air hand drawers.
After the hot air driver washed his hands and dried, the number of livers on the boats was seen to increase by 254% on the floor.
After drying up by the jet Air Dryer, the total number of organisms on the boats was increased by an average of 42%, while the number on the floor grew by 15% .
After Pepper Towell washed his hands and drying, the total number of livers on the boats was lost by an average of 76% and the number on the floor by 77%. Scientists tested to check whether it was likely to be polluted by other ventrum users and the dwellingroom environment as a result of each sort of drying.
The Jet Air Dryer that throws air out of the unit 180 meters per second (650km /ta; 400MPH) faster, is able to fly it from hands and units and proliferate the washroom users and the dwellingroom environment for 2 meters long.
With the use of a warm air drawer, microorganisms spread from the driver to 0.25 meters.
No significant spread was seen due to paper towels.In 2005, a study conducted by TUV Produkt end Umwellt was evaluated to turn different hands.
After drying your hands, the following changes appeared in the number of bacteria:
Many hand drier manufacturers are in expectation, and hand drivers have been compared to drying by paper towels.
In travel, when soap and water are not available, there is an option for washing your hands.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must have at least 60% alcohol.
Hungarian physician Ignace Semeweis was mandatory to wash medical hands after he was diagnosed with his effectiveness in preventing disease in the hospital environment (1846).
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
In one study, their use showed a decrease in the amount of infection.
Washing a medical hand is at least 15 seconds, with a large amount of soap and water or gel to use and wash each part of the arm with a knife.
Hands should be bounced between one another and together.
If the rust is trapped in the nails, you can use a Bristol brush to remove it.
It is important to wash your hands clean and clean rumilla with clean rinse as you can fit into the water on your hand.
After drying, you should use paper rumal to close the water (and to open the exit door if needed)
This prevents those surfaces from being contaminated back with hands.
In the health service, the purpose of washing your hands is to remove the diseaseic microorganisms (7 million) and avoid spreading them.
The New England Journal of Medicine notes that the lack of hands washing in a very medical environment has remained on an unacceptable level, where largely the doctors and nurses forget the routine of washing their hands before touching patients and thus the infection of microorganisms.
One study has shown that properly washing your hands and other simple techniques can reduce the circulation of catheter-related blood flow 66%.The World Health Organization has published a correspondence with an ideal method of hand-in-hand washing and hand-washing in the field of health services.
A guide regarding hand cleaning through the organization may also be found on their website for public comment.
Vitboys and others had configured the relevant overview.
If regular adherence is necessary, professional tools can measure and validate the cleaning of the hand.
The World Health Organization’s Hand washes the hands are five moments:
If you have a relationship with the fluid in the blood/flesh
Before you do the work of incompetence and
When the patient is cared for, if there is a mass of antiseptic chemicals in the soap, it produces an act of murder in the washing of hands (as well as in the use of antiseptic chemicals).
It may require an act of killing such a place before surgery or an anti-resistant life is largely in place, to continue and close hands without touching the hand 'to smell' for surgery, chlorhexidine or iodine rice, to dry the hands after washing, and to clean up the wastes under the base of the unsaturated brush and fingers.
All ornaments should be removed.
For this process, you need to wash your hands and parts from mango to cooper in general for 2-6 minutes.
Too much time (10 minutes) there is no need for grass.
When washed and washed, the water on the part of the cooperator should be avoided from going back to the hands.
When hand-drinking is complete, hands are dried by the bare cloth, and surgical songs are mounted on the limb.
To reduce the spread of joints, it is better to wash your hands before and after taking care of the sick person or use the joints for your hand.
For control of the styphilococcal infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of washing your hands was from washing the first 20% and as the frequency of washing your hands increased over 35% was a very small advantage.
If you wash your hands with simple soap compared to a live soap, there is more than a third rate of animal infection in the food. As with a 30 seconds, alcohol smoking is estimated to reduce the risk of brushing your hands and your liver washing your hands with an alcoholic soap, it is estimated that there was a 26% reduction in the infection of the liver by brushing your hands with alcohol.
However, H1N1 influenza A virus and chlostridium are more effective than soap and water based fluids on the hand. In the intervention to improve the health care settings, staff can be trained to wash their hands, provide more access to the alcohol based fluids of the hand and provide more access to the staff writing and mouthpiece reminders.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are most effective in various health services settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is also considered a cheap and necessary means for obtaining good health and good nutrition.
However, the lack of soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools, and workplaces has made it a challenge to achieve a universally washing behavior.
For example, despite the cheap option to build a place of washing hands in most rural parts of Africa, there is a lack of pulses to wash their hands near each private or public toilet.
However, lack of the amount of hand washing can also result in the dying habits rather than the lack of soap or water.
The soap encourages washing of hands and its reward can affect the determinative decision, be aware of the benefits of hand washing, and change the long-term behavior of the population.
This requires supervision and evaluation to be implemented effectively.
It was found to be a systematic of 70 studies that the community based view is effective in increasing the amount of hand washing in LMIC, while social sales activities are less effective. One example that encourages washing hands in schools is the 30-star view by Uniseph, with the other needs of cleaning, encourages schools to make easy, independent measures to ensure their hands wash with soap.
As at least the standards are achieved, schools can eventually go from one to three stars.
It may be a part of creating a place to wash your hands in an activity that encourages washing your hands to reduce disease and child mortality.
The day of global hand washing trying to change behavior is another example of an increase in awareness activity. As the result of the corona virus's partner in 2019-20, Unisef preached to confess the Imoji of hand washing.
Some studies have taken into consideration the relationship of Daley that has avoided the effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries.
However, an overview suggests that it is significantly more independent to encourage hands washing with soap than other interventions of water and cleaning.
In particular, injured soldiers in recent-professioned mothers or hospitals are particularly vulnerable in situations - two leading persons working on hand cleaning in the middle of the 19th century recognized the importance of washing hands for human health: Hungary's Fijian Ignaz Cemewice, and the English Institute of Modern Nursing, Florence Nightingale.
At that time the majority believed that there was a famine in the land, called Miyamas.
In 1980, as a result of food exposure and health care-connected infections in the United States, disease control and prevention centers were more actively encouraged to wash hands as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
With the eruption of the Swain Flu in 2009 and the Kovid-19 in 2020, it has created awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect itself from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, images of public toilets and office buildings and airport toilets were placed next to the washing sink.
The speech of what one's hands wash is to take responsibility for something or to share it's gaps.
It originated from the Bible paragraph in Matthew where Pentius Pillet washs his hands in regard to the decision to ascend the cross, but in some English society, this speech came with more extensive use.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, her guilty conscience is forced to wash the imaginary stain in an attempt to clean up the alleged crimes committed by Lady Macbeth and her husband.
It has also been found that after remembering or meditating on immoral works, people begin to wash their hands more often than others and that they have more time to put their hands on the wash instrument.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a thought are less likely to be busy in other acts of charity, such as volunteer service.
Cleanliness and iconicness are said to wash hands in religion for both reasons. Useing hands to wash water, but not using soap is a part of the washing of antipsychotic hands, which includes the washing of hands in Baafeth, Hindus, and leaders of Judaism, the levabo in Islam, and the bride in Islam. Religions are said to wash their hands especially after certain action.
It is obligatory to wash your hands after you go to toilet in Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikh, Judaism, and Islam, it is obligatory to wash hands before each meal and then.
Control of Workplace Risk caused by Covid-19
The control of the workplace risk caused by Kovid-19 is the application of professional security and health methods to control the restrictions of Coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19)
Proper control of risk on the workplace depends on the nature of the workplace and the nature of the work, which is the source of infection, the seriousness of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to covid-19.
According to the U.S. professional security and health administration (OSHA), there is at least a professional contact with people and other colleagues with low infection risk factors, for which the original infection prevention measures are recommended, including helping workers to stay at home when they are ill, including regular cleaning and nonsmokers regarding respiratory and workplace.
Employees with moderate infection risk include works that are not known or not known to have been committed to Covid-19, but that may have been contracted by existing community infection or international travel.
This includes Ashaya workers who are in contact with the general population, such as in schools, in the workspace with dat population, and in some large rental sales centers.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the risk control for this group includes using air playouts with high- potential air-filters, using sneez Guards, and having personal safety equipment available for that if a person encounters covid-19.
Covid-19 considers a high infection risk of a known or suspected person who is in contact with a known or suspected person, OSHO, in which he may be doing a process that produces a worker aerosol or a known or suspected person with a covid-19, thus increasing the risk of opening too much.
Risk controls that are appropriate for these workers include negative pressure vintilization rooms and engineering controls such as the personal safety device that is suitable for that particular task.
The eruption of Kovid-19 can have a number of effects on the workplace.
Employees may be irreprehensible from work due to the illness, the need to oversee others, or because of fear of possible infection.
In both terms of what items are required and the way to get those items, commerce can change patterns (such as buying or buying through distribution or drive-thru services when there is a low neck.)
Lastly, goods can be spent in coming out of the geographical areas that are strongly affected by Kovid-19. Preparation and response plans can be used for infectious illness to perform security action.
In dealing with various workplaces and tasks, these address the level of risk strategies of risk factors that arise from the source of infection, domestic and social areas, and the risk factors of each employee, such as aging or older medical conditions.
They also determine the outline of aggregation plans for situations that may arise due to the necessary controls and eruptions necessary to address those risks.
Preparation and response planning for infectious disease may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives for an eruption's response include reducing broadcasting among employees, protecting people who are at risk of developing health disorders, maintaining professionally, and reducing the opposite effects on other things in their supply chain.
Where there is a business, it affects the response to the illness in communities of the place.
There is a window of position of risk controls widely used in professional security and health to determine groups according to the effectiveness of risk controls.
Where the risk of covid-19 can not be completely removed, effective controls in all, these are engineering controls, then administrative controls, and ultimately personal security devices.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from risk in relation to work and can all be a self-sufficient solution to implement this.
Administrative controls are to change the function policy or processes that require workers or applicants to act.
Unlike engineering and administrative controls, personal security equipment (PPE) is considered effective, but it can help prevent some infections.
Depending on the risk to the worker, all types of PPE should be selected, according to use, and should be properly put on the appropriate seat (e.g. respirators) and properly, regularly checked, monitored, and replaced and properly removed, clean, and set aside or set up their appropriate excuse to avoid infection.
According to the U.S. Professional Security and Health Administration (OSHO), jobs with low infection risk have at least professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended to follow basic infections prevention measures for all kinds of workplaces, including the above and completely wash hands, if they are working sick, to motivate them to stay at home, to cover their faces when scratching and scratching, to make sure to provide tissue paper and waste after delivery, to prepare remote or nonspecific shifts, when needed, to keep others' tools and equipment from using the tools and equipment, and to maintain the routine and maintenance of the workspace.
An important step in quickly identifying potential infectious individuals and its division is to protect workers, customers, investors, and others at the workplace.
American Disease Control and Prevention Centers (CDC) recommend that employees who are exposed to serious disease symptoms regarding breathing, as long as they do not take other medications that reduce fever or change symptoms, they are not fever, fever symptoms and other symptoms until they stay at home and the prevention of illness are flexible, which allows employees to stay at home to care for the sick member of their family and employees know about those restrictions.
According to OSHHA, middle infection risk jobs include jobs that do not know or suspect the infection of COVID-19 for Ashiya people are known to have been infected, but because of the community broadcasting that continues around the professional area or because that person has recently arrived from international travel to a widely spread area of COVID-19, she may have been infected with SARS-COV-2, six feet (18 m).
These include Ashiya workers who have been contacted with the general population, such as schools, dat population locations, and some large rental sales centers in Ashaya. For these and more high risk groups, place high-capable air filters in engineering controls, raise air to keep the air, and place a physical barrier for consumer-tw windows for consumer services. For this risk group and for the high risk groups, it may be necessary to move workers to stay in the homes of the administrators, instead of visiting virtually simple communications, to set up a wide range of business, including road traffic jams, road traffic, and road conditions that can be used to set up for personal use.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person falls sick in the air, proper controls in order to protect the workers and other passengers include keeping that person separate from the other people 6 feet away, assigning a cru member to serve the sick person and giving a face mask to the sick person or telling the tissue paper to cover its mouth and nose when digging or cooking the sick person.
When serving a sick delivery, or touching its physical fluid or potential sensitive surfaces, it is necessary to wear a desphoable medical gloves and the sick delivery will have a fever, a constant loss or difficulty in breathing, while the cabin crew must wear an additional personal safety device.
Gloves and other despogable items need to be separated into an organic pitfall and then clean and extrude the infected space. For professional ships with aquarium and other passenger ships, put on travel lengths while in risk controls and if they are sick or if they get fever or other symptoms, it is necessary to make self-reglugation and indicate the medical center on the ship as soon as possible.
ideally, medical support is needed in the room of the separated person. CDC recommends temporarily closing it for cleaning and non-smoking if a person found an infected in the school and child facility at the center.
Where it is a medium community spread, social distance restrictions can be applied, such as field trips, mobilization, and physical education or food in prayer classes or substituting other large gatherings, increasing distance in Desks, and changing times of departure, restricting unwanted fires and setting up a separate health center for children with symptoms like flu.
While there has been significant infection in the local group, along with the strategy of keeping social distance, schools can be considered to keep off more days.The staff who always enforce the law that always works, are believed by the CDC to have a slow risk of health.
Officials who implement the law need to interact with other people who are infected or infected with Covid-19, are advised to follow guidelines with appropriate personal protective equipment like emergency medical technicians.
If there is a close contact during the period of care, employees should use their Duty Belt and gear again to clean and extrinsic and defamatory the standard operating system using household cloning spray or wine and for a controlled period as well as for the use of the PPE, to keep clothes apart and wash them.
OSHA believes that certain staff in health care and respiratory care are at risk of high or hypertension.
Works with high infection risk include health care distribution, assistance, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who come in contact with known or suspected Kovid-19 patients.
If employees are passing the Aerosol-building operating system on known or suspected Kovid-19 patients or are collecting or handling samples from such patients, they are at extreme risk of infection.
The aerosol-making operating system includes incubation, Coff Induction process, Brancoscopies, some tooth system and test or aggressive sample compositions.
Works in the kitchen that are at risk of high infection include employees who are involved in preparing the corpses of those who are known or suspected of covid-19 at death; if they die, they are at a high risk of overcrowding them. These risk groups include aggregation rooms for known or suspected patients in additional engineering controls.
In some health care and respiratory structures, the specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate.
The biosecurity level should handle the sample with 3 processes.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients will be suspicious of Kovid-19, then they should be separated into free waiting room. Along with the other PPE, OSHA recommends that those who are known to be infected with sers-covy-2 should use the respiratory engine from known or suspected patients within 6 feet and use an aerosol-making process.
In the United States, NIOSH approved N95 respiratorymask or better breathingmask should be used with reference to a written respiratory protective system, including tacit-chieving, training, and medical tests.
Other types of respiratory defenders may provide better protection and may be more comfortable to employees.WHO does not recommend protecting the entire body, as Kovid-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread out of the rest of the body.
Only employees who choose to access the site recommend using a surgical mask.
Without any aerosol-making processes, it is recommended that patients who are collecting the respiratory samples of patients starting to treat Kovid-19, care or transport them, WHO recommends using surgical masks, goggles, or face covers, gowns, and handmos.
If the aerosol-making process is passed, you should use N95 or FFP2 respiratory defenders instead of surgical mask.
Since PPE's global supply is insufficient, it should use physical barriers such as telemedicine, clean windows, which can only be accessed directly to health care providers for certain tasks in the room with Cowd-19, recommend reducing the use of PPE for them while not serving several patients with identical diagnosis, using the same respiratorymask without placing the care and coordination of PPE on the supply chain and others who do not have the symptoms of masking.

This month we find ourselves in a significant situation.
COVID-19 With the World This is a matter that explains the responsibilities of being associated with one another of world humanity and the responsibilities we have about each other.
We do not have previous illustrations of the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the global empathy, cooperation, and building a group with our organization's heart.
The outstanding proof that we are lucky enough to have the chance to work with so many wonderful people is the virtue and care that all of our colleagues see from email, phone and chat.
I can't feel more grateful and proud than this when you call me a colleague.
During the last week, someone commended me for my work.
They reminded me of how meaningful it is to be able to read Wikipedia right now for the world and how powerful a symbol is to be available online and everyone.
If you are keeping these sites up to date, or paying our partners, or keeping your group safe, this is only possible because of your work.
The world of information that Wikipedia is providing is now much more needed than Erwey.
This is the moment in which we do not only what we do but also how we do it will have a meaningful effect on the world.
The importance of this campaign and your role in it will result in some significant changes in how we work together, the beginning of the week.
Changes in Our Work and Work Journals
As Robin pointed out earlier, C-Tim's yesterday night meeting to discuss his view and journals in the future days and months.
In that conversation, we thought about what response would be appropriate to the one we were dealing with and the best way to maintain the organization at this time.
We have a strong desire to remove stress and help our campaign for a long time.
You want to dial back, even though it's not wrong.
For all employees, contractors and contractors:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until the following instructions are given.
We're not announcing holiday - if you're going to work more common hours, you'll be using you in this campaign.
However, your health is our priority now, and you may want to care for your loved ones, bring rental items, or go to a doctor.
We don't take your time.
If you are sick, don't work.
You don't have to say this, but we're saying this.
There is no need for sick or PTO - just tell your managers and help your team repair into the calendar and journal so that you can be informed of the important part of the work being completed.
(If you were diagnosed with covid-19 positive, please tell Brian in Tandsy Ops, so that TandC can support you and be careful to take proper attention from management to your situation).
Employees who work on hours will be paid full fees.
We have already told, and re-explain our contractors and employees who work on the hours are built up to respect our building partners.
Everyone will be paid like tashi work in his usual usual situation.
If you are sick and unable to work, you will include it.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to share the tension about the world around them.
Especially in this period of time will the benefits of what we do in this type of period.
Again, this is about your own care.
Our request is that you communicate with your admins so that we know what to expect and we can change accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
Some things that we need to continue to do are things that we must continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety and Funderizing Teams (also some of them) work important work, which may seem to need additional help.
In order to evaluate the current goals, we will start the process with all sections and focus on helping us with the essentials for our campaign.
There is plenty of work to do for all of us, we will only focus on most important projects.
If you work slowly now, you won't be able to do it later.
Once, it was worldwide that we did not have a plan to double our time in order to complete the work.
You will no longer expect extra hours to work to comply with the work time that seems to be unreal.
We accept that the situation has changed, and when appropriate, we will work to determine new goals and journals.
What were the APP (year-old planning)?
Our objective in adjusting expectations about our new realist and nandusday work time is to adjust time to time for the passage of time of our 2020-2021 annual planning.
Our goal is to propose to extend our 2019-2020 plan, this allows employees to have more time to make assessments in order to promote important tasks, their own care and care for their victims, who need to work for the next few weeks or who want to work for a less period of time.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the ongoing planning workload and stress throughout the organization.
In the next week, we will present our proposals before the assembly and we will update our representatives and associations for the next action as we will be confirmed.
Thanks to the APP organization for our leadership in this.
Office conditions, infections and cleanups
Last week we learned that a worker in our SF-field was likely to have COVID-19 virus.
Nevertheless, with extra caution, we have set up an anti-corruption Cleaning Association to destabilize all areas in San Francisco's offices.
They use every surface, as well as lobi and the edges of the announcer's coming to our floor, the high-sized anti-depressant dam used in medicine.
The building uses such products as her own caution measures to help her eaters' safety.
We find satisfaction in this because when we decide to return, these offices will be fully ready to work.
Our DC office is located in WeWork areas, where their measures about COVID-19 with us and all other DC-field employees have been summarized.
Last week, our DC office with San Francisco has been completely changed to a remote set-up by following the guiding principles that have been associated with San Francisco.
As we know some of our NYC-field partners, we are discussing how to take a place in Brooklyn at the playground.
These discussions are ongoing, but we can be Ushir in it.
Some of our associates are doing remote work first.
The colleagues who work remotely from time to time know that this will only be a reconciliation, and they want to give us some salaries:
Limit the duration of your meetings to more than one or two hours.
If you need long sessions, think about how they can be divided into several days.
Explain the task list of meeting clearly and send the material to them already.
To facilitate direct co-workers and connections, make this video default through tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
To make each meeting accessible, ask someone to lead it, which will keep attention on the chat for the questions asked and check the list of speakers and ask someone else to help take notes (or take notes with your own help).
If you want a convenient headset, send an email to the technician assistant.
Use your 'black return' for nasty.
To talk with your colleagues about the task assigned, include in the # remotes channel in 'slake'.
The Human-communication Operations Team is looking at 'Webinar based Argonomics' to help the growth of the work that has been distributed throughout the organization.
In the past week, we asked all community contributions receivers to hold a wikimedia-aided public-smaroh like the Edietathons - as long as WHO does not announce the epidemic to end.
We told them that we have learned that it would be impossible to complete their agreed contributions-in-law due to our request for exemption and other restrictions, and also stated that this would be a delay and no one would be punished to change the target.
The next week, we took the extra guidance provided for Wikimedia and other regional and topical community assembly.
A common sense of the entire global community is sad about this breakdown but at the same time it appears to be both happy and happy to focus on this explanation and on our own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As we go on, the CRT communities are working to monitor this effect and establish a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space to the community to make our transmission with them.
Living in touch with COVID-19 related issues.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held on Thursday, 14 :00 UTC/ 07 :00 PT.
We're going to use this time to facilitate additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time understanding each other.
In this article, we are with all of us, and we are in a position to help.
Meanwhile, we continue to get information through this email and get other significant information about COVID-19 on office-Wiki.
CRT will keep this page up to date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working with employees to maintain regular transmissions, living in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have any questions about travel, concerts, a major workflow, or challenges taken in thought, or if you want help in any other matter, do not hesitate to indicate CRT and work with them.
We are about to establish contacts if we are here, help and cooperate and need it.
If you have an confidential or sensitive content close to you, please send email to the manager-Brain Juan of the Human Resources Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a abandonment and bond of our work.
Instead, they are authorized to acknowledge that our work and obligations will now need to be applied in a way that we had never done before.
These are the steps that we need to cooperate with each other in our opinion so that we can continue working, provide the needs they have, and provide them with the services they rely on.
When the time comes, our theocratic activities will help us to do what is right.
Now enough, this time is to work together and create space for important tasks, which will meet in the next week and possible month.
Since we all need you to do this, you need to take care of yourself and your family so that you can give your best when you need it.
Now please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Adra K, Amy V., Brian J., Dorwin D., Gregory V., J. L., Lynette L., Ryan M., and Tony S.). And the rest of the members of the Leadership Team (Grant I., Thiser W., Jamie V., Jenny U., Liza S., Robin A., and Toby N.).
B'Angiotension-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of the cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
By reducing the amount of angiotension -II and increasing the amount of Ang(1-7), ACE2 opposes the action of a related angiotension-converting enzyme and therefore it is a promising drug for the treatment of diseases regarding the heart and blood vessel. For some coronary arteries, it serves as an access point of entering the ACE2 cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotension-converting enzyme 2 is a digested metaloenzyme that is on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein consists of a N-terminal peptide M2 domain and the C-terminal Colacterine Renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pass type of scleric skin protein that is active with the action of its enzyme on the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
The additional occupational domain of ACE2 is broken off from the second transmembrane called Shedes and the result is released into the membrane protein blood and eventually dissolved in the urine.
ACE2 is in most parts of the body: the screening of the lungs II alveolar cells, the entrocytes in small intestines, the endothelial muscles of the artery and head of the nerve membranes of most parts are connected to ACE2.
The ACE2 mRNA is found in the Cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brenstam.
Acting as a resistance to ACE is the primary task of ACE2.
ACE angiotension I gives Hermione access to vascocontracting angiotension II.
In that exchange, the ACE2 angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) breaks the carbonyl-terminal amino acid and is hydrolyzed in vasodilater angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Hyle-Pros-OH).
[des-Arg9]-Bradykinin, apeelin, neurotensin, dinophine A and many other peptides, including grelin, can break up ACE2.
The neutron amino acid transporter also regulates the transport of the screen of SLC6A19 and includes the disease of Hartnup.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main access point in cells for some corona viruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (which causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (which is caused by a virus causes COVID-19).
Specially, the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of the membrane had the effect of binding with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2's Spyc S1 protein in endocytosis and the transfer of both the virus and the enzyme were in the endocytosis.
For the access process, the host serine protease TMPRSS2 also needs to atone for the S protein, whose restriction continues as a possible treatment in the current investigation. This has led some to conclude that if the level of ACE2 in the cells decreases, it will help fight the transition.
However, many professional organizations and organizations recommend continuing standard ACE constraints and ARB therapy.
The systematic overview and meta - analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that the use of -ACE constraints was also related to reducing the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to control.
In addition, those who were more vulnerable to pneumonia, especially those who suffered strokes and heart closures, increased their risk when the Asya patients were treated with ACE inhibitor.
Although the results of the ACE inhibitor were less strong than the total risk of pneumonia, the use of ACE was related to reducing mortality rates associated with pneumonia.
The Recombinant Human ACE 2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for the severe loss of lungs and this led to the improvement of the pulmonary hemo dynamics and oxygen content in pigeons with lipolysaccharide-prefered severe respiratory trouble syndrome.
In humans, half of the life of rhACE2 is normal 10 hours and the result takes 30 minutes to start and the result is (causing)24 hours.
More recent conclusions show that the classical renaissance-angiotension system inhibitors (RAS inhibitor) or inequalities of angiotensi may be a promising drug for those with non-existent diseases.Effected rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical triles for treatment of severe respiratory distress syndrome.
b-COVID-19 Anps are software applications in mobiles, which have been disconnected to help interact with Corona Virus epidemics as a reaction to 2019-20, i.e. the process of identifying individuals in contact with a infected person (9 contacts 3).
countless applications were developed and proposed with official government text in some provinces and workspace.
Several frameworks were developed to create contract tracking applications.
In particular, concerns have been expressed regarding privacy in systems that take charge of the geographical location of the app users.
Using the bluetooth signal to log with the user's other cell phone is included in less anonymous options.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly declared that such Blue Tooth based apps would be directly integrated into their Android and iOS operating system to support.
Chinese government's combined currents in China have provided an app that allows citizens to check if they came in contact with COVID-19 bounding people.
In more than 200 Chinese cities, the app is used. An enp is used in Singapore called Tres Tugadir.
An app was developed from a local I T Community and was made available as a free source and accessible to the government.The North Macedonia launched a bluetooth based anp 15stop corona to contact people with potentially infected and respond to health services officials.
Anap was developed from the Ministry of Depression and Technology and Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, Anp Google Play Store and Apple Anap Store were in a waiting position for the approval of the app store.
An app is in an advanced state of development and said that it would be available in a few weeks on April 12, 2020. A similar enp is done in Ireland and in France (9stop Covid 2).
Both Australia and New Zealand are thinking of annaps based on the Tres Tugeder of Singapore and the Blue Tooth Protocol. For patients infected with COVID-19 living in Moscow, it is Russia's intention to present a Guiofensing End to ensure that they will not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of possible practical difficulties in anap based systems, including the misperceived Pogitative and anap usage of only if limited to a small amount of the population.
Directional or harmful (Koronavirus) to be concerned about the spread of the anps, Apple set limits on what kind of institutions could add Corona virus-related anap store to their app store, this limited only to 3-authored or otherwise prominent institutions.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy publishers expressed intense concern in terms of the results of the use of Corona virus apps to hold a large amount of adherence, especially about whether or not the foundation facilities designed to keep up with the practice designed to deal with the Corona virus epidemic will be destroyed.
Anonysity International and 100 other organizations have asked for limits on keeping in Asya types through a request.
Organizations announced eight o'clock for government projects:
Keeping in practice may need to be a country, necessary and authentic;
The extension of maintenance and maintenance will need to have sunset clauses;
The use of data is limited for the reasons of COVID-19;
Information security and indisputability will need to be secured and shown to be protected on the basis of the evidence;
Due to keeping digital, it is necessary to avoid strong bias and subsidies;
Combining information with the third party should be defined in law;
The rights of citizens to protect against abuse and to respond to the abuse;
With public health practitioners and subsidy groups, it is necessary for meaningful participation of all - connected participants. The German Chaos Computer Club (CC) and Reporters Widout Borders (Reporters Ohne Granzen)(RSF) have also issued a checklist.
Once the need for the tracking mechanism was met, it is the intention of the proposed Google /Apple plan to focus on the problem of keeping it permanently away from their device operating system.
Some countries use network based locale tracking instead of apps where the need to download an app eliminates both the ability to avoid tracking.
Network based tracking was approved in Israel.
Network based Solutions that have access to raw location data have important potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with intermediate servers need to reach personal location data; many privacy protected systems have been created which use intermediate servers for intercommunication only.
In South Korea, a system used to present contract tracking which was not based on the app.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system gathered various tracking data with mobile Divice tracking data and card deal data, and integrated potential -contacted individuals to create notes via content message.
In addition to using this information to warn against potential contact, the government has publicly made information of the location available, after the emergence of the MERS in that country, due to remote changes in information privacy law, something was allowed.
Through countless apps and websites, this information is available to people. Other countries, including Germany, considered Intermediate and Privacy - Protected Ashaya systems.
Details have not been announced until April 6, 2020.
Privacy - Protected Contract Tracing is a well-established concept, with a research material from at least 2013. By 7 April 2020, more knowledgeable groups were working on privacy -annual solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log with other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a consistent effort that has both intermediate and decentralized Ashiya and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes decentralized privacy - finding proximity (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contractsEvent Numbers, CEN), privacy protocols and mobiles for contracting the protocol (PACT) and others.
These protocols never leave the linesable personal data divices and all matches were on the device.
Private groups in the MIT Media Lab are developing SafePath, which is the scope of using confidentiality protected systems in order to manipulate the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on this research in the fact that the White Paper (Apps Gone Rogue) released in March 2020: Mantising Personal Privacy in an Epidemic. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace, created by the Enigma MPC company, is a company that originally developed a privacy technology, which was originally established in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure data hardware technique to allow users, without compromising the privacy of that data, to facilitate sensitive location and health data to other users and officials.
On April 5, 2020, the World TCN Uti was founded by Ashiya groups who were originally gathered around the same view and mainstream cover protocol and have to reduce their explanatory distribution, enable the efficiency of demand and alerting applications, which are the main aspect of the broad engagement.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had free access to the BlueTrace Protocol used by their official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, declared initiative for contract tracking based on settings of bluetooth Low Energy Technology and Private Cryptographies, in which they claim that confidentiality will be kept.
They also published the features of the original technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be brought to three stages:
Roll out of the tools to enable governments to create government privacy - defend the Corona Virus Tracing Anps.
This functionality is directly involved in iOS, AndroidGoogle, and Apple by distributing the system through first operating system upgrades and after the risk has been removed again and planning to focus on constant maintenance problems.
B'drug repositioning(which is also called drug reperpizzing, re-profiling, retiring, or theoraptic switching) means that children use a drug approved for a disease or disease to treat another disease.
This is the same type of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and qualitative treatment for COVID-19.
Plasma infection for the lesions and re-organization. Sers-kov-2 have 66 dregable proteins, each of which have multiple associated binding locations.
The analysis of such a binding location provides a suitable wind to produce a factor anti-inflammatory drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Very important sars-cov-2 target proteins are in papene-like proteins, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, heliquez, S protein, and ADP ribofosphatase.

Chloroquin is a snow-drunk drug, and it is used against some self-regulated diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that four of the drugs that will be studied as part of a Solidarity Medical Test would contain chloroquin and related hydroxychloroquins.
The New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who reported that tests in the New York State on Chloroquin and Hydroxicculoquin, would be performed since March 24th. On March 28, it was given the right to use the imgency Uygency Othorization(EUA) under the FDA.
Through the FDA's medical testing process, approval has not been obtained for these treatments and those who are enrolled in the hospital but have been granted authority under the EU for those who cannot receive treatment within the medical test.
CDC has been stated that the use, quantity, or duration of 3sars-cov-2 infection for treatment or treatment of hydroxychloroquins has not yet been verified.
When there is no other option, it is reported that it is used by doctors.
A small study has been held from the Turkish research path in Istanbul and is being used in it with the use of chloroquinas as a punishment, a quality of life, a life expectancy and de livelihood.
There are a wide range of studies beginning at Duke University and Oxford University.
As a preventative solution from the NYU Longon Medical School, the safety and quality of hydroxycloquin is being tested.
Favipiravir has been claimed to be fully effective from Chinese medical tests in Wuhan and Shenzhen.
If the trial of 35 patients at Shenzene in 4 days came Negatetive, it would be 11 days' period of illness of 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia at Wuhan, half patients were given fevipiravir if half were given umifenovir.

A study on Lopinavir/Retonvir(Caletra) in which the joint study of Lopinavir and Ritonvier against the virus was conducted, according to his conclusion, no one was seen of the benefits.
Drugs were developed to prevent the production of HIV copies by binding with proTs.
The pathologists at the University of Colorado are trying to improve these drugs and find compounds that are bound with the protein of SARS-CoV-2 . The drug prepared to use HIV/AIDS is being criticized in the scientific field for doing the new purpose.
The WbleuHO included Lopinavir/retonvir in a Solidarity Test.
Remdisvir was produced and developed to treat the infection of Ebola virus and Marburg virus.Gilled science then discovered that the phylo-, nemo-, paramico-, and corona- anti-inflammatory anti-viral anti-inflammatory anti-inflammatory anti-inflammatory anti-inflammatory virus activity appeared in the phylo-.
One problem that is in antidepressant treatment is the resistance developed from mutations which results in more serious disease and infection.
According to some of the previous tests pre-test studies, it is likely that there is a higher gene interest for resistance in Remdesvir. Some medical tests continue, with two tests being conducted at Cleveland University Hospital; for people with a mild illness and for those with a second serious illness.

The major platform objectives in the phase I security study are:
Nucleic acid(DNA and RNA)(train I developers and Vaxin Condidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vectors (train I developers and Vaxin Condientate: cancinino biologics, adenovairs type 5 vectors)
According to the information received by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaxin condidates are in the pre-ups of development, which confirmed that 78 projects have continued (according to the Milken Institute 79), and other 37, and has been published very little information about it has been reported (as being located or planned).
It is generally remembered, plasibo controlled, and done in a number of locations in order to determine exactly the exact, quality amount of safety and performance capacity in advanced I-III tests.

The University of Waterloo School of Medicine at Canada announced on April 16, 2020 that it was planned to create a form of DNA-based Vaxin Condidate Nakawatt.
Using the genomic membrane, the DNA will be formed which will produce antibodies in human organisms and produce a non-living toxicity-like particle, which will stimulate the immune system and stimulate the reaction against SARS-COV-2 viruses.
In March 2020, the Cloud Computing Resourcees of Hewlett Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, combined resources with the United Nations Government, industry, and three universities.
Some vaccines have a contrast effect, which can also be called the result that is not expected.
This means that other benefits can be derived from other than the cure of the disease.
Next, 4,700 health care staff will be assigned to a memorable test in Australia.
The vaccine that is developing is not safe or qualitative.
ACE2-transgenic molds, other laboratory animals and humans, such as COVID-19, are indicated to have the need to be internationally consistent to handle life-threatening toxicity from previous research to evaluate the quality of vaccine on specific animals such as ACE2-transgenic mold and other laboratory animals.
The SARS and MERS opposite vaccines have been examined from humans to other animals.
By 2020, the solution of SARS for humans has not been available or the lass of both safe and quality.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of Novel Vaxin and medicines for treating SARS was a function that has priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. There is no authentic vaccine for MERS has gone away.
When the mars became more powerful, it was assumed that research on the SARS that was running would provide a useful model for finding vaccines and medicines for the cancer-cove infection.
By March 2020, one(DNA based) MERS's vaccine had been completed in human beings with a pro-professional I medical test, and function on three other vaccines, all of which were viral-vectored vaccines, two adenovial-vectored (ChADOx1-MERS, BFRS-Gamvack), and a MVA-VAVAL-MS-S.
The post on social media has continued the discussion of the carspace, according to which the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and the lass on it already available.
The patents that came forward as evidence from various posts on social media refer to the patents that exist for the genetic order and garlic of other Coronans such as the SARS Corona virus.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease and it comes from the CVer aqueut receptor syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
These are common symptoms of fever, loss of breath, and difficulty in breathing.
Other symptoms can be fatigue, nerve pain, excessive appetite, appetite, and stomach disease.
The period of symptoms to appear from being interrupted is usually five days but this can be between two to 14 days.
Its mild symptoms are shown in multiple patients, while in some patients an increase in disease and resulting in toxic pneumonia and single-celled organs release.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million patients in the 210 country and land, of which 153,000 patients died.
More than 5,680,000 patients have been cured from disease, the spread of this virus mainly comes from direct contact with people, often through leaks, sinks or leaks of speech.
When you leave your breath, these tusks are thrown out and fall on the ground or on the surface, they do not take infection at a very long distance.
It can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching eyes, nose, and mouth.
This virus lives for 72 hours on any surface.
The first three days after symptoms began to appear are highly infectious, however it can also be lost before it sees the spread symptoms and post-diagnosis.The real-time reverses of Nasagrassy Drava's real-time reaction is the standard method for diagnosis (rRT-PR)
Those who suspect that the virus has been engaged and are advised to use masks to serve them.
There are different sanitaries given to use masks by the general public, some officials oppose to use masks, while others recommend using it, and some say that it is necessary to use it.
For COVID-19, there is currently no specific anti-viral treatment or vaccine available.
There is a record that disease has occurred in the majority of countries in all six areas of WHO.
In patients who are infected with a virus, there are sometimes no symptoms or symptoms like flu, such as fever, skull, fatigue, and difficulty in breathing.
Paining to breathe in sudden symptoms, feeling constant pain or stress in the chest, feeling as confused as it is, suffering to walk, and seeing faces and lips blue; it is recommended to go to the hospital immediately if these symptoms occur.
Symptoms can be symptoms such as sneezing, nose leaking, or neck loss.
Symptoms regarding food was shown in some patients with low amounts, such as potatoes, reverses, and extremes.
In some patients in China, it was initially shown to feel deep in the chest and heart beats.
In some patients, disease was reported to increase in pneumonia, to release multiple parts, and to die.
These are called incubation pyramids.
The incubation pyramid of COVID-19 is usually between five and six days but in some it may be two to 14 days.
97.5% of patients with symptoms developed were shown in 11.5 days after infection. Reports show that symptoms do not develop in all infected patients.
The role of carriers without these symptoms has not yet been clear; however, it is said that they are involved in transmitting disease from early levels.
The proportion of patients who do not have symptoms in infected patients who have not yet been diagnosed and have had a study started, at the same time it has been reported that 20% of the patients confirmed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(KCDC) have not had symptoms in the hospital until then.
China's National Health Commission began to include patients with no symptoms since April 1; of 166 infected patients who came in front of that day, 130 (78%) patients had no symptoms at the time of examination.
Both Tunky and Lal have a large venom burden.
When speaking with a loud voice, more beats are thrown out than normal speech.
According to a study conducted in Singapore, a hole in the mouth without covering the mouth can lead to about 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although this virus is not derived from the air, the National Science Academy has initiated its risk of bioerosol transmission and has found Posetiv virus RNA in samples taken from air associations outside of people's home.
Some medical processes, such as rinsing in the body and restoring heart and blood vessels, can fly through the respiratory pathway and thus spread it through the air.
When it is concerned about spreading it through the membrane, its risk has been considered to be low, it is most susceptible to this virus by people with its symptoms; in addition.
Although it is not completely clear how easily this disease spreads according to The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), it can be transmitted by two to three people from one person. This virus survives from a few hours on the surfaces to a few days.
To say exactly, this virus has been found to last for up to a day on the paper. It has been found on the surface of plastic and steel (AISI 304) for three days, while on the surface of 99 percent of copper, it has been found for up to four hours.
However, it depends on the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere and changes so.
If soap and detergents are used properly, they can be effective for this; soap products are inhibited by the acute protective layer of this virus, inactive of it, and separate from skin and other surfaces.
Other measures, such as benzaconium chloride and chlorexidine glucone (a form of surgery) are less effective.In a study conducted in Hong Kong, the red sample was taken in two days since it was introduced to the hospital.
Five of the six patients found the most diseases in the first sample, and in the sixth Rugana, the most diseases were found in the test taken the next day.
Sivier Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a corona virus with symptoms regarding a new excess breath. He was first drawn from the three rugs that were associated with the centre of nimonia of severe respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of this new SARS-COV-2 virus appear in the Corona virus related to it in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by a domestic soap that produces its protected budbuda. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the virus's native SARS-COV.
COVID-19 causes the most effect on the lungs, as the virus reaches the original cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the second type of air cell in the lungs.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called 'spike' to connect to ACE2 and enter the original membrane.
12 percent of patients who are enrolled in hospitals in China, Wuhan, have also found severe heart injury and this has been found repeatedly in serious illness.
Due to the heavy response of the body during the disease transmission and the cry of resistance, there is a great deal of symptoms of heart pain, but it can also be associated with the adoption of ACE2 in the heart during severe pain of heart.
The ACE2 grey elements are abundant in the heart and include in the heart function.
Examples of blood clotting (31 percent) and blood clotting in headaches (25 percent) have been found largely in serious patients of COVID-19. They are probably closely associated with non-organized disease. Their lungs have been diagnosed (defuss Alweller Damage) and have also found white cells that have become exposed to the lungs.
Although SARS-COVID-2 towards ACE2 has a tendency to exercise sensitization along the medicative muscles of the respiratory, there are symptoms of hyperinflammation in serious patients with COVID-19.
In particular, it was found to be associated with the appointment of Dahuk IL-6-servous monosites in the covid T-pesi in the patient GM-CSF-straper T-Pesi.
It has also been shown to insert white cells from suctions.
The World Health Organization has published several rules to test this disease.
Real-time reverses transcription polymerase Chen Reaction is the approved method of testing.
It is generally tested on samples in the respiratory pathway received by the arms in the neck; however, it can also be used for this.
The removal of the test is usually available within a few hours or within two days.
Blood tests can be performed, but this requires two samples of blood made by the distance of two weeks, and the immediate value of its extraction is low.
Chinese scientists were able to separate this corona virus and publish its genetic Sequences. This allowed the laboratory around the world to develop independently of the polymerase Chen Reaction (PCR) tests.
By 4 April, 2020, antidepressant tests (which can be diagnosed with a current infection and in addition to saying that a person had previously had an infection) were developing, but that large amount was not used.
The experience of tests in China tells its accuracy to only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point of Care testing to use at the end of that month on 21 March, 2020.Experience of the diagnosis guidelines announced by the Zongan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods of identifying infections based on the risk of chemical features and disease prevention.
The initial infection consisted of a bilateral multilayer ground-glass opacity with the distribution on the perennial, asymmetrical, and background.
The disease growth may cause subplural domination, odd pavings (to become lobular septal cleaved with altered alvell filing) and condensation.
There is some little information about the body management and minor injuries of COVID-19.
Some important factors regarding the disease found in the corpses are:
Things that can be seen by eyes: the stain of the lungs cover, the pain of the heart cover, the stability of the lungs, and the susceptibility of lungs
There have been four types of severity of spread pneumonia:
Soft pneumonia: lung susceptibility, overuse of lungs, unsatisfactory large muscles of the lungs, interstitial inflammation, and the formation of multiple large muscles
Severe pneumonia: Excessity of lungs and uncontrollable fluids in the lungs
Diffuse Alveller Damage is the cause of severe pain regarding breathing (aute respiratory disorder syndrome) and a severe lack of oxygen.
Diagnostic neemia: the uncontrollable fluid gathering in the lungs and interstitial fibrosis in the lungs
Blood: Exploiting and mobilizing within the artery (determinated intravascular coagulation); leukorithroblastic recation
Solutions to reduce the risk of infection include staying home, avoiding neck places, hand soap, and water frequently, keeping your breath clean for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or your mouth with unsanitary hands.
It is recommended that you hold the rumal in front of the nose and face while you are scratching or rinse, if not rumal, cover the nose with the edge of your hand.
It is recommended that you clean your hands after any loss or scratch.
The CDC has suggested that the purpose of social dissertation is to reduce contact with a large crowd of people infected by schools, offices have been closed, restrictions on travel, and large amounts of people have been restricted.
For example, in the United States, for example, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that at least 6 feet [6 m] of land per year, the number of people living in the United States alone is about one third of the world’s population.
Not yet known as the drug that COVID-19 would be preventable. Although this vaccine is soon said, it is not estimated to arrive until 2021, so now the important part of the management of COVID-19 is to control the disease. He is also known as 'Flataning the Cerve'.
People should wash their hands repeatedly for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, especially when they go to toilets or when their hands appear to have been damaged, before eating and after putting their hands to the nose and after washing or cooking.
Next, CDC recommends that a bone sanitizer with a fraction of alcohol should be used with at least 60 percent of alcohol. However, when soap and water are not available, it should be used only when there are no commercial products available. The World Health Organization has provided two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, the immune activity is derived from ethaneol or isopropanol.
In order to prevent the growth of microorganisms in alcohol, hydrogen peroxide is used; it is 'not a substance that is activated for the arthritis of the hands.'
Glycerol has been included as a component that maintains humidity.
Patients are being managed by a professional Carer, which includes providing oxygen, providing support to the vital organs that have been treated with liquids and other effects.
CDC suggests that those who suspect that we are a virus carrier should wear a simple face mask.
The treatment from outside has been used to provide oxygen from the outside for the problem of the respiratory pathway disappearing, but it is still aware of what its benefits are.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyles and diets have been suggested to enhance resistance.
Supportive trimentes can be used among those who find mild symptoms at the early stage of infection . The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to care for patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19.
The U.S. serious patient and fusion patients have been given under the same free source as IBC by combining recommendations of treatment from various agencies.
April, by 2020, no specific treatment has been specified for COVID-19.
Symptoms suggest using paracytemol at first instead of some medical professional ibuprofen.
In order to minimize the risk of virus spread, it must only be taken prioritized, especially during the process that creates the ferritants of larvas in the air, such as tapping into the body or using the medical facility at hand.
For health workers concerned with COVID-19, CDC also suggests to keep such custom in the Airborne Inflation Isolation Room (AIIR) as well as in the use of the Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) in the time of the CDVID-19 patients. CDC also highlights guidelines for use of the Personal Prosal Equipment (PPE) during the partner.
The recommendation of preventive devices made for the gentleman: PPE Gaun, respiratory engine or facemask, safety for the eyes, and medical handmoges. If available, you should prefer respiratory engines instead of facemask.
N95 respiratory engines have been approved for the industrial system, but, the FDA has also approved use of masks within the Imgency Use Authority (EUA).
They have been designed to protect themselves from particles such as dust in the air, however, other uses cannot ensure its outcome for a particular biological medium.
When masks are not available, you may also use a mask designed at home as a cover for the face or a final solution according to CDC's recommendations.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 are not as serious as medical Ventilation or as some option required, but a few percent of it are ugene.
COVID-19 The type of medical respiratory therapy that patients receive due to complications in the respiratory pathway is ongoing studies for people in hospital . The high flow through the nose can be avoided by the process of laying the veins or bilevel positive airway pressure.
For patients with serious illness, neither of these two have the same benefit or not.
If some doctors are available, attackers prefer such mechanical Ventilation therapy, as they limit the spread of disease in the system by limiting the spread of disease in the air by lowering the flow from the respiratory tract. The level of disease being serious is high among older people.(in those who are over 60 years of age, especially those who are over 80 years of age).
Even in many developed countries there are no beds in adequate hospitals, so if there is a sudden increase in the number of serious patients with COVID-19, they may be limited to the health system's capabilities when handling the question of loading them into hospitals.
As seen in a study in China, 5 percent of all patients were introduced in the ICU department, 2.3 percent of patients needed technical support of ventilation from outside if 1.4 percent of patients died.
About 30% of the patients who were introduced to COVID-19 in China had to eventually be introduced to the ICU department.
Since patients with COVID-19 develop severe problems related to respiratory pathway (ARDS), technical ventilation is becoming more complicated and providing oxygen becomes more difficult.
As we fill out the oxygen supply of ventylates and high PEEP that have the capacity of pressure control, wentilators will need to reduce the risk of lung damage as well as nemothorax.
High capacity PEEPs on older ventilators may not be available.
Research on potential treatments started in January, 2020, and many antidepressants are passing through tests after.
RemDecivier appears to be the most reassuring in it.
Although new drugs will take up to 2021 to develop, many tests have been approved for other uses or they are going through more later tests.
A test of antidepressant drugs can be performed on serious illness patients.
Volunteers who are recommended by the World Health Organization participate in tests to study the effects and safety of these potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily approved the treatment of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not gone through chemical studies to determine that they are effective and safe treatments on this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are told to put their name and identification numbers in it.
From observed information, these can show the app 'near contact' and from it can understand the potential potential for infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If possible risk is directed, this app suggests self-algamation. Not so, it provides information to local health officials. Big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technologies, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore to focus on those who are infected and those who come in contact with them.
In March 2020, the Israeli government granted security departments to check the data of people who were likely to be exposed to coronary virus.
The measures were made to protect those who could come in contact with the dissociation and infected citizens.
In March 2020, the Dutch Telecom delivered information gathered to the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, to the site of the phone.It will be used to prevent the spread of virus and research.
Russia has established a face-to-face recognition technology to search for people who break apart dissociation.
Italy's regional health affiliated Julio Galaria said that they were receiving information via mobile phones.
The German government organized Hakkathon in weeks of 48 hours with more than 42,000 participants.
It is also a global challenge for Estonian President Kersti Carlulide to take some solid measures against the spread of Coronavirus.
People may feel uncomfortable with all of this because of the fear of separation, travel prevention, the reverse effect of treatment, or lack of interest.
BBC referred to this speech by Roy O'Connor as the root cause of social isolation, isolation, health care, stress and economic decline of people's mental health and well-being.
These diseases may have little symptoms or not only symptoms, whose simple cold-cook is with other respiratory disease such as this.
A mild case usually heals in two weeks, while serious illness can apply for three to six weeks to heal.
The SARS, such as MERS, can say on the basis of other similar virus information that pregnant women who are seriously infected by COVID-19 may have a higher risk, but in this case there is no information about COVID-19 . Some people can affect COVID-19 lungs, which causes pneumonia.
In people who are seriously affected, COVID-19 can develop a acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS), which can result in a loss of breath, being a septic shock, or having multiple components to be released, etc.
COVID-19 matching gaps include cepsis, abnormal clots of blood, and heart, obesity, and a loss of yin, and kidney.
6% of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 have been exposed to dissolving blood clots, attention to increased growth during prothromin period, as well as 4% of these groups have found that the function of urine in urine has been distorted.
Nearly 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have found that there is a high- York enzyme.
The same report states that the period between symptoms of illness revealed and death was ten days, 5 of which were to be admitted in medicine.
However, the seven - day period between hospital care and their death was a period of seven days.
Early Cases Studies found that the period between the period between the early symptoms of illness was 14 days long.
A study by the National Health Organization (NHC) of China stated that men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
The histopathological test of the post-morphum fusion sample shows the diffuse Elviolor decay with cellular fibromyoxide in both lungs.
Viral cytophaetic changes were evident in nymocytes.
The effluent respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) of the picture of the lung was simple.
Among the deaths recorded by the National Health Organization of China, 11.8% of the deaths recorded by the National Health Organization showed a high level of troponin or heart failure.
Of the people introduced in medicine according to the US March report, 89% of the people already had some complaints . The availability of medical resources and the social-economic status of the area are also affected by the deather.
Regional distance changes the estimate of death rate in this situation, while also due to the difficulties of the method.
Decreasing mild case counts can lead to higher mortality estimates.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of cases that have been contacted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate has been reduced.
People who smoke in comparison to people who don't smoke have a potential to see the serious symptoms of COVID-19 are 1.4 times higher and approximately 2.4 times more people need extreme supervision or are likely to die. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term frequency of this disease.
Officers in Hong Kong's medicine found that in some people's lung capacity, 20% - 30% had decreased, which had been cured from this disease, and the lung scan showed that the organs were damaged.
When this heals, post-intensive keir syndrome is likely to occur.
By March 2020, it was not known whether the previous infection provided effective and long term resistance in people who were cured from this disease.
Depending on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, it can be said that resistance is likely to appear, but asia Casees in which after recovery from COVID-19 have been recorded that the testing of Coronavirus was positive in the next few days.
It is believed that Asya Cases could have long infections rather than re-estament.
It is believed to be a natural virus, and its root is a creature, and its spread is caused by infection.
His real root is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of this infection had been entirely caused by infection from human beings.
A 41 case study confirmed by COVID-19 published in January in 'The Lenset' showed that there was a starting date in all of December 1, 2019 symptoms revealed.
Official publication by WHO has recorded the beginning date of the symptoms of December 8, 2019.
Various measures are usually followed to calculate the mortalityr.
These numbers vary according to various areas and different times and are affected by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the duration from the initial origins, and the age, gender and overall population feature.
During the end of 2019, WHO has provided the deaths confirmed by the SARS-COV-2 facility to U07.1 such emergency ICD-10 code, and has provided medically or epidemiology-19 deaths diagnosed by COVID-19, which have been diagnosed in a given period of time. Death-to-case factor demonstrates the number of deaths separated by the number of cases diagnosed with Kases.
According to Johns Hopkins University figures, global death-to-case multiplication is 6.9%.
According to the field, the number is absolute. Other strategies include case death rate (CFR), which demonstrates the percentage of people diagnosed, who die due to a disease, and include the 'consum death rate (IFR), which demonstrates the percentage of the infected person (made and not diagnosed) who died of a disease.
These statistics do not have time bindings and depending on the specific population infected by the means of that case version.
Not all infected people develop antibiotics, the presence of antibiotics may provide information about how many people are infected.
At the centre of the eruption in Italy, in a small town called Castiglion de'Adda, people have already died 4600,80.7%.
This disease in Gengellet led to carnival fastuals and its spread among the young people, leading to a relatively low mortality rate and perhaps not all COVID-19 infected deaths can be formally classified.
Furthermore, there is no heavy burden on the German health system.
The Netherlands may have approximately 3% of people's antibiotics, as has been reported from blood donors.
69 (0.0004% of the population) have confirmed the deaths since COVID-19.
The effects of this epidemic and the death rate are different for women and men.
Studies held in China and Italy found that men are more likely to die.
Men who are in the age of fifty are at the risk of the death of women and men in the ninth decade.
In China, men's death rate was 2.8% and women's death rate was 1.7%.
The definite cause of these gender-incomes is not known, but the reason for this may be regarding compliance and behaviour.
The distance of gender-based resistance in women, the lower scope of smoking among women, and the developing co-patient conditions like high blood pressure in men at low ages, may be the reason for death rate among all men.
In Yorop, there were 57% men in infected people, and 72% of the people who died by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. regime was not getting gender-independent information in the infected people.
Research found that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a greater risk of infecting these viruses.
WHO announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease would be -COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Tendros Adonom Ghebreys, stated that CO's mean corona, VI mean Virus, D's mean disease, and 19 is the year when the first eruption of this disease had come to attention: 31 December 2019.
The name was given to avoid referencing a particular geographical site (such as, China), animal species, or group of people, which followed the international recommendation of naming, and the purpose of this was to avoid scandalating anyone. COVID-19 due to the fact that this virus is called the Sivier Eut Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-COV-2).
In public transmission, WHO uses the -COVID-19 virus - and 3COVID-19 responsible for the virus.
This disease and viruses are both commonly referred to as the 1Coronavirus.
Wuhan, at the time of the initial eruption in China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as the \"Coronavirus\" and the 15wuhan Coronavirus.
In January 2020, WHO followed the 2015 guidance against using the site in the names of these diseases and viruses, recommending 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCOV acet Respiratory Disease as interval names for this virus and disease.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the lack of capacity in the standard elite, some digital creators are printing health care materials as Negel Swabs and Ventilator Parts.
For example, in one of Italy's medicines, when the Ventilator valve was in urgent need and the provider was unable to compensate at its time, a local startup company did reverse-engineering and print 100 valves at night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the disease's roots, dimensions, treatment, and other cases built up the cut-carp, incorrect and distorted information, and spread online rapidly.
It was noted that humans were capable of spreading this virus in some other animals.
The study was exempted from finding evidence that the virus was duplicated in ducts, bads, and lamb.
No drug or vaccine was approved for treatment of this disease.
International search work on the vaccine and medicine of COVID-19 through the government.
In March, WHO launched the 3Soliderity Tril4 to refute the treatment effect of the four existing antiviral compounds that were most efficient.
There are currently no lasses available, although various agencies are actively creating 'Los candidates'.
The study done earlier on SARS-COV-2 is being used, because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 systemic to enter human cells.
So far, three flexibility strategy has been discovered.
First, the aim of the explorers is to create an entire virus lesions.
The purpose of the use of Asia virus, then whether it is inactive or dead virus, is to generate a new infection with COVID-19 in response to the rapid resistance of the human body.
A second strategy is sub-unit vaccine, whose purpose is to produce a vaccine, which sensitive the immune system to a certain subunit of viruses.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, such research focuses on S-Spike proteins that help viruses distinguish the ACE2 enzyme system.
A third strategy is about nucleic acid leses (DNA or RNA vaccine, an amateur technology to produce lesions).
It is necessary to test any of these three strategy's safety and impact of the experimental vaccine. In Seattle on March 16, 2020, a vaccine medical test was launched with four volunteers.
This vaccine has a riskless compliance code, which is copied from those viruses that cause this disease.An antibody dependency has been suggested as a possible challenge for developing vaccines for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
According to the report by April 2020, more than 300 active medical tests are being conducted.
From the treatment already approved for malaria, seven tests were executed, including four research operations on hydroxylroquene or Chloroquin.
Most Chinese research practices include multi-purpose antiviral drugs, according to reports presented at the end of April, include nine tests on step-III on the step-III on the tread-infection on the RemedyCivir.
According to the report on April 2020, the dynamic review of medical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates has been addressed to many existing antiviral drugs for treatment of COVID-19, including Remedicvir, Chlorocykin, Lopinavier/ Rytonavir and Interferon Beta.
According to the report of March 2020, there are temporary evidence present for impact by Remediciver.
Medical improvements had appeared in patients treated by RemedyCiver.
In the United States, China, and Italy, step-III medical tests are being held . Chlorovine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with initial results.
However, for this research function, there is a need for reviews.
Korean and Chinese health officials have recommended for the use of chloroquin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Wireology notes when recommending a gram dose per day of this was that its double dose is very dangerous and he can even die.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued permission for the use of anti-interferrons, Rybavirin, or umiphenovhier, on the basis of the conscience of doctors who treat patients with COVID-19.The Chinese seventh edition of guidance also includes anti-Corporon, Rybaviran, or umifenovir.
Primary data says that test requires a high dose of Rybavirin to inhibit SARS-CoV-2.
Nitzoxanaide has been recommended for further testing following the demonstration of low saturation restrictions of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have noted that it is very important for early spic protein processing through interaction with ACE-2 systems to access to SARS-CoV-2 through transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
With or without it there are major difficulties in studies of chloroquen and hydroxychloroquins that inhibit the medical community from following studies.Oceltamivir did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in experiments and had no known role in its treatment of COVID-19.

Viral neutronization is the expected system of function, by which inactive antibody can be treated against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other systems, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytes, can be possible.
Other forms of inactive antibody treatment continue to develop, for example using built monoclonal antibiotics.
The production of convalescent serum, which includes the blood fluid protein of patients who have been cured and which includes antibiotics that are specific to this virus, can be enhanced for rapid development.
