Black box in your car?
While U.S. street makers are struggling with a lack of wealth to improve the ruined highway system, many people are seeing the solution in a small black box, which fit your car's dashboard.
This device, which monitors every mile used by the motor driver and transmits that information to the authorities, has become an issue of a controversial attempt for Washington and state planning office to finance the major streets of the United States today.
In general, such as the Hawaiian planning, the emerging work has suddenly become an issue of profound arguments and living alliances.
The miles you've been driving, and probably you've been driving, and you've probably been using this information to create a tax bill - have met with libertarian environmental groups to support the government in favor of allowing use of these black boxes.
The tea party is crazy.
The American Civil Independence Association is also very concerned with taking various forms of privacy issues.
While Congress couldn't agree on whether or not to perform further operations, many states are not waiting.
They are searching how they can go to a system that pays for each mile set on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which is GPS Monitoring.
It's really essential for our country.
It's not about whether or not to be selected by us. It says Hassan Iqharata, who is the executive director of the South California government organization, who is planning to begin tracking each mile determined by motorists in California by the year 2025.
We're going to change the way taxes are paid by us.
It's protagonist to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's High Trust Fund has become virtually bankrupty, with revenue from American citizens paying taxes on gas pumps.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they once did.
Now the car runs more than before in a gallon gas.
There was no increase in the federal taxis in the past 20 years, which is 18.4 cent per gallon.
Due to the high value of gas, monarchy also avoids raising a money in the taxis.
Transportation policy at Minnesota University, specialist Lee Münich, says it's not absolutely complicated.
Their state has recently been tracking devices in 500 cars to test per-mile payment system.
They say, in the long run it will serve as the most reasonable option.
Wanks calls it a Miles-based user free.
It's not surprising that the idea is pleasing to urban liberals, because, for example, it can be changed to make taxes to change as a car, which can help reduce jams and reduce Greenhouse gas.
California's politicians are interested in this system while they are developing strategies to meet the goals set in the state's continental Global Warming laws.
But the president of the Home Transportation Committee, Rip. Bill Shuster (A-P.A.) also considers the Black Box as the most practical longest option.
Free vendors in the Reagan Foundation are also in favor of payment per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, president of the policy in Reagan, said, it's not just what's going on in the dark dogs.
People are paying more directly for what they're getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport sectors who had been privileged to move forward in their report with Congress in 2011.
The U.S. Senate had accepted a survey project of $90-million last year, including 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing individuals who had to travel too much to go to the election work or go to the city, Sadan's leadership ended the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction.
It has the most willing Oregon, listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
These drivers will soon pay meelage fees instead of gas the state.
Nevada has already finished the initial test.
New York City is also moving towards this direction.
Illinois is under trial with trucks on a limited basis.
And I-95 buildings, including 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) along with the Eastern Seaboard, are studying how they can act on this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where this device was put on cars of 50 voluntary car drivers a while ago, drivers were very tired of thinking that the government could monitor every step of their turn.
Aloudin Khan, who directed strategic and performance management management in the Nevada Transportation Department, said that anxiety was the main problem for Big Brothers and similar things.
It's not something people wanted.
With the passing of the test, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: “It would be quite easy to convert these devices into full tracking devices.
There is no need to develop a huge, unmanaged technology format that must be spread to keep each person's daily access record.
Nevada is one of the many states that are trying to get the most useful technology, with the help of the state to get information about how many miles the car is going on every day, but it is not where and when it is going.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to the start-up of a small California launch called Trau Miles.
This firm was not primarily in business to help drivers to rule.
It was trying to get into the rising market of auto insurance, which had to pay drivers based on their miles.
But the device that this is testing was interesting to the health planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at a specific time interval.
Rayan Morrison, chief of True Miles, said, \"If you don't track people's pace and their location, they'll be more willing to follow this approach.\"
These initial programs of the state have made some big mistakes.
There are very few expensive and less intervention methods to do this.
In Oregon, planning drivers are using different options.
They can choose the device without using the GPS or without using the GPS.
Or you may choose not to take any device again, but you may choose to give it according to the average price set by the citizens of the kingdom.
Other places hope that more than less access to the device may be lost to concerned citizens.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a texting device that also has access to paying parking meters, paying according to their drive. Bema will provide a collection of real time data from other drivers to avoid traffic.
The city planning document mentions that 3motor drivers will be attracted to participation because of the benefits it receives.
However, some transport planners wonder that the entire discussion on payments according to the mill is a great deal of distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Organization in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that by increasing Congress gas taxis, the problem of the Divalia Highway Trust Fund can be solved very easily.
Highbridge or other car drivers can also be put on extra one-time or even annual fees, whose vehicles do not use too much gas so they can pay their appropriate share.
Randy Rentschler, director of the conference and public affairs, said, \"When Espirin can work, what's needed to do for him.
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.

Zahid opened his clothes and put all his stuff on the side, while Rachel went on the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, Jared wasn't there, his only clothes were.

Hans Peter Frederick, the German internal affairs minister, told Zeit online: \"Mr. Snow-Den is ready to talk to German authorities, so we must find ways to make it possible.
The relationship between the United States and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA has bugged the phone of Chancellor Angel Marcel.

Frontier Airlines will pay Care - On Bagge
Frontier Airlines has plans to charge $100 for passengers on their plane board.
Frontier Airlines has a plan to start a charge for $100 for a carie - on-bag and this will pay for $2 for coffee or soda, although it has announced that the passengers can keep the entire combo.
The new carie - on for the bag in the free overhead bin, so, the little bag under the seat will still be purchased.
Frontier said that $25 would charge if paid to the Advanced, $1100 would have to wait until they were at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that $100 is to be able to take care of the charge in the Advanced.
-We don't want him to charge.
Airlines started charge for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to escape travel money fill as much as they can in Carey-on Bagge that's a database in the Overhead debox, this means that this box is often less space.
There's a way to bring less passengers on the free board.
O'Malley said it's not really about putting up the new charge.
It's about Frontier for the most loyal clients that find the Overhead Bin is rapidly becoming difficult.
Airline doesn't have to give it to passengers who buy tickets in their website.
This means that the next person in the line could have 100 dollars for a similar bag, while a passenger on a front guard gate can get a bag free.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and checkin's processes are being changed to ensure that passengers know about fees before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new carri - on fees, will not start until summer even if a date is not specified.
Travelers often express discontent about the budgets for free and other profits, but air services like them.
They argue that it costs money to handle the badge, and those who want passenger services should pay for it.
The fees on Wall Street have been seen as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the air travel costs after the loss of years.
Most of them are not even in the carie - on bag free.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started Carey - On Free Three Years First, and partner Discovery Allegitiont Air later.
With such a fee, another Airline Hungary's Wz Air, who said Airline Counseller J. Sorensen, and who tracks Ad-On Phases.
He brings Spirit's Carrie - on the fee of $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former officer of the Midwest Airlines recently flew into Spirit and surprised passengers at the gate with Carrie-on unusual bag fees.
The 2boarding process that I saw in my airline carrier was easy, he said.
I was hoping to kick my teeth and see out on a battle gate.
It was full and he said it was illegally-split.
Frontier is also following the $2 free of coffee, tea, soda, or spirit for juice.
Frontier Neka that's a passenger soda, or a juice they can keep the whole debba, and it'll only give free coffee for once.
It'll still give the water away.
In the US Airways summary, he tried to charge for drinking substances in 2008, but after the travelers complained, they went back seven months and followed any other major airlines after they were there.
If Frontier's passengers don't buy directly from the Airline, this step of the Frontier to make a free charge on the carie - on it is their fresh effort to conduct this move to customers to their own website.
Airlines pays online travel vendors for $10 to $225 per sold ticket.
That's why all Airlines have been encouraged to operate passengers through an online travel agency rather than go through them directly.
Frontier, though, has gone further into this area.
In September, many of the flights started at a distance of the mile for customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, this subtracted Miles Award until 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, one thousand miles from an online travel agency will apply a distance of 250 miles.
It's also that they allow you to choose your seat in advance for single passengers to buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier's Denver has a loyal base of customers in his home city, but its business is losing and it's losing money.
The fall of 9 percent in the state and its flight capacity have been reduced by about 13% in the first three, according to the financial results of the Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic Airline is attempting to finance the firm as part of the sale.
N.S.A. accused of 3 internal error, rather than hackers for crashing websites.
The mysterious national security agency said to Friday that some technical lack had shut our website for hours, not because of hackers, as some people claimed online.
Khufia Agency said in an email sent case, the NSA.gov night was not reached by many hours, which was due to an internal error during the pre-default update.
This problem will be solved today's evening.
It's not true that this obstacle, distributed by service, came due to attack.
The evening, the online server trackers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is still not available for some users.
The N.S.A. spokesman told the A.B.C. news that the agency's internal, sensitive network, had not been incompetent.
The user said no classified information is in danger.
At least one activist group has claimed online that they are responsible for banning the NSA website by DDOS attack.
D.D.S. attack is designed so much that traffic is sent to the target website until the site is overloaded.
This cyber strategy is expected to be random and the purpose of attacks is not to undermine the internal network of the target system.
The former highly secreted N.S.A., which was sometimes called \"AC no agency,\" has become a subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people after the events of foreign and domestic spying events in the past months - which were commonly separated by Edward Snowden. The files were secreted by agents and secreted by agents.
Because of this growing controversy about agency, after tonight's incident, such arrests were made that the event was the result of the attention cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in parallel to the story of the Dawaper Age and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's scenarios, a teacher is forced to walk the wrong way.
The show's good-looking theme was combined by the Chief Guests Minister of Parliament Valmiki, President of the Secretary of the Assembly, Shiphrah Rastogi, Naresh Consal, and Power Lion.
In the play, the Davaper Age's drones and currents of a professor Arvind's situation were shown to be similar.
In the drama directed by Anal Sharma, India famine Sharma, Anal Sharma, Vinod Bechin, Hemant Goyle, Border Samar, tribal quadi, Abid Sami, Shiwa Gazala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun, and Aurjun and Amar.
The lighting system in the play was designed by young colourmakers of the C. Raj and Set. Hemant Kumar.
At the top of it, various avards, literary, cultural contributions from Atta were provided.
It was given to Mr. Yinn, Uddu Division of the Lion Vivi, Dr. Wellm Jamshedpuri, senior journalist Shanbunath Shukla and Color Workers Zendra C. Raj.
Secretary Surndra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushi, has contributed to the success of the organization.
Bombardier fell into the profits of the plane, falling into orders
The Canadian Air Force and Train Meker Bombardier Inc reported the fall of 15 percent in pure profit on Thursday, at the third tie in its railway unit and at the under-law issues, under pressure by air command and delivery.
Montreal based Bombbardier also offered a update on issues of any flight test data for his brand new CSeries plane or his critical program to go from the next September to the commercial service.
Nearly one more half month after the first flight of the test plane, it's just three times flying, question whether that's on the test phase track.
The result fell less than predicted and the share sent to the Toronto Stock Exchange for over 8 percent of the slide.
Cameron Dorssen, an analyst with the National Bank Financial, reduced his rating for Thursday from 30th to 15 field display. The stock is limited to one or two of the next.
-Major aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with the Margin performance in transit, said in a client note.
We'll get new orders for Bumbardier CSeries as progress of the flight testing program.
However, if no one is announcing the new command in months coming, there'll be doubt that the market program will be compromised.
Bombardier hopes the plane family can now cut it off at the low end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test was suspended in the plane March and after late months had been flying for the first time in September.
Possible crates wait for new jetliner fuel tenancy and possible cost saving company's claims to be approved for the results of the flight test but as strong order for CSeries is to 177.
There are 403 entire order and commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Chief executive Pierre Budoin believed that Bombardier would fulfill his 300 firm order target from the time he first brought down jet commercially.
The authorities assured analysts and Thursday that the program was running according to schedule.
The test plane had been on the ground for a long time in forecasting comparison, said Bodein in a conference call, adding it to the ground testing and software updates were determined during the interplay of the aircraft.
Every creator builds a schedule in a different way.

New research has revealed that we work with the whole honesty and dedication of the morning.
They don't lie to anyone, and they don't think so as to steal or cheat.
But in the evening, we change our mind and we start opposing the rules by putting the model on the one side.
In this research in Harvard University and the David Alex School of Business, researchers have given a number of interesting facts.
According to Researchers, we prefer moral values without stress in the morning, but at evening, fatigue or more pressure leads to a loss of honesty.
Researchers used two for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell you that the point is higher to the left or to the right.
The participants were told that if they answered the wrong answer instead of the correct answer, they would be paid.
In this extension, people who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and answered correctly.
It was found there from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. when they were using the people, they deliberately misjudged their values.
This has succeeded in proving that the greed for money in the morning doesn't make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening, we stop paying off morality.
This research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.

Mr. Big's secretly informing Mr. Big about the police investigation to blackmail Koken's older lawyer.
42 - year - old Ditta reported to a notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The prosecutor felt that people could find out about the drug addictions of his secret drug
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
To the top lawyer of the defense party, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of his drug secret, people will know, three years old.
After the 42-year-old Brahasht ditta was able to compromise his cocaine habit, the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough provided sensitive confidential information about his drug examination of the sociative activities.
This official, who was nicknamed \"Bash\", and praised by the criminals as the Autotop brief,\" was arrested from his home in Scarborough in 2011 after the police surveillance operation, which he had represented in the past Narcotics Trail.
The authorities saw 32-year-old Scarborough in Blackburn, Lancashire with three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house, though he had gone out with his colleagues to La Society Dinner.
Dita's hair, his wallet, and his credit card found the cocaine particles and found that Dita was a legal user of drug abuse in A category.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally receive information about the arrest of two people from Scarborough and his assistant.
The main investigation of the heroine and cocaine group, operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Mercaside, Burkshire, and West Yorkers, was being watched by the police at that time as part of the main investigation.
There were 32 others, who were sent to jail after being sentenced to 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine during several prints by the police.
42-year-old Dieta gave information to the criminals, for he was afraid that people wouldn't know about his cocaine addiction.
The situation in Blackburnard was facing a failure today in the Liverpool Crown Court following the three weeks after the trial in Dita, Liverpool Crown Court.
He had admitted about keeping cocaine in the hearing before.
The lawyer's bad time started when the police found out that he had been in regular contact with Dita since February 2011.
Two spies followed the condolences and saw him coming to Dita's house and having more than 60 percent more pure nasal medicine under the lawyer's bin in Black Golf Grove.
After the drug was kept, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Dita, who had gone out for dinner in the Blackhorn Rovers Football stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer arrived home, he found that there was a drug there, and there was a conversation between them nine times.
The court heard that Dita's hair, bats, and credit cards were found in the trial when she was found a decocon's legal user.
Dita was later arrested, but he refused to use cocaine and said that he was talking to the corresponding dealer, because he was his client and said that his discussion was a subject of technical privileges.
During his arrest, Dita tried to remove her wallet and remove a lot of credit cards, but they were forced, and his hair was modeled.
In the police witness, he said he was also running office from his house with his workplace, and calling at his home for his client's legal affairs.
After stating what the spies knew about them after being arrested, the court said that Dita was calling the leading people of the Nashili medicine supply order, some of which he had previously presented.
Anny White, on the side of the engineer, said: \"The government must be best known not to break the law.\"
Mr. Dita is accused of using his position as a criminal agent, too much more to connect with his particular client.
We're not talking about general drug dealers, but about dealers who are providing a drug to their lawyer.
Some of them may have been without doubt of any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went somewhere beyond his limit of lawyer-client relationship.
He blocked police investigations as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dita was not honoring his profession, but insulting.
He made a lot more radical than a certain client, especially from Scarborough, and he allowed compromise with his freedom.
Dita refused any wrong action and claimed: ‘If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to give information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would immediately do this.
But after hearing, the Superintendent of the Lancashire Police said: “At the time Mr. Dita began to receive drug abuse from organized criminals, they turned themselves into criminal criminals.
Because of his cocaine addiction, he made extreme compromises and became too weak for the purposes of former members of organized crime groups, who used it to get important information related to police investigations.
Users should maintain the highest standard of integrity, and fill confidence and confidence in people.
Mr. Dita has been deceived by this belief and has tried to survive in his profession.
Mr. Dieta, a serious and organized crime unit of Lancashire, found guilty of keeping them and now restricting the course of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring criminals to court.
The case should be a warning to the criminals that no one is away from the law.
We'll search you and present you in front of the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment after he was found guilty to supply heroin, cocaine and veng.
Thirty-five other members of the group were sent to Caracas for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session, saying that his Fantasy Job would have to be a lawyer for the client who died in the United States, Mohammed Ali's dinner guest, and the inequalities to be motivated by their work.

Ben Greenmann: 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy celebration: The New Yorker
People can argue that New York is the birthplace of the standup comedy in the United States: about a hundred years ago, the laughing dramatist Frank Fe, who acted as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to speak directly to people sitting in the crowd.
Fe's search has been extended over the years, most recently, in New York Comedy Festival.
This year the 10th anniversary of its 10th anniversary, which included more than sixty show in the small club and the large theater, was founded by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Stanford Institute.
Hirsh says, most of these Headlines appeared in the Carolines, and became a great success, to the level where they became too big to play in the club.
We created the celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Wanda Six, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Mahr, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military service in Madison Squayer Garden, 4st Up Hiroz, including Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby, and other artists.
With the expansion of the celebration, the world of comedy has expanded as well.
Many come from non-traditional media, such as Comedy Central, F.X. and Spike.
Nick Krool, with Dip-Cable Sytcom (F.X.X.'s inverse of Runchi Fantasy-Futball theme), reached the main location, and now is his own comedy Central Sketch show.
Jenny Slate, the Cost of Night Live, and the 2PARCs & Recretion, are being the best known for her wireless video series.
With Kroll and Slate, other young people with different voice-like voice comedy (probably a different C depressed voice, anthony Jessellnic, unsatisfactory, concentrated on ethnicity, W. Kamau Bell) are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the celebration will be: Talking to Larry David of David Steinberg:
Stinberg had started working as a standup comedyian, but they have become nominal television and film director, as well as unauthorised comedy historians.
From 2005 to 2007, he was a hostess of a show called the ‘sit down comedy' on TV Land.
This visit will be at the Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
Stinberg said, the city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Lari works.
They were telling me that, when they were here, sometimes they went to the street between two buildings and themselves thinking that if I ever lost my whole money, I would be here.

The court has banned the activity of the New York Police Department's pause and grave policy
On Thursday, an organizational appeal court required a judge's order for the New York Police Department's pause and creda program and prevented changes and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Circuit Courtapile 2nd judge Shira Shindeler said that judges will delay the consequences of an appeal by the city.
In the city of judge, it was ruled by a violation of the Constitution in August of the way it was done outside its program of interrogation.
The city's police department also includes the decision to assign a surveillance to help change its policy and its associated training program, its conclusion and its therapeutic order appeal.
The appeal court heard clear arguments on Tuesday on the request trip.
The appeal court has said that because he proposed a judge's requirement to avoid the presence of partiality in part of a series of media witnesses and that the public should be publicly accountable for misbehavioring the U.S. judiciary to the judges.
The judge had decided that the police authorities misbehaved the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pauses and credulity program.
He has appointed an outdoor monitor for major changes including policies, training and research, and he gets the most closed where the body's wearing cameras in some areas has ordered a pilot program for testing.

An oral argument on the appeal of the city is listed for a while after March 14, 2014.
The pause and grave device have been criticized with citizen authorities.
The pause and creda policy have been somewhere around decades, but most of the black and Hispanic men, from 684330 to 2011, have reportedly stopped dramatic growth under the administration of Free Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
A trial was made by four men in 2004 by all minorities and a class action case.
The supporter of change in the NYPD's pause and the Kreeda program has said that inappropriate behavior will end with another more reliable and effective police force and may affect the use of policy of the other police department.
The opponents say change will reduce the police's mindset, but crime, money, and not corruption will solve a broad problem of police force under pressure by thousands of authorities during the last decade.
The judge has noted that there was no end to the pause and creda, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD's stop.
The training included a considerable number of goods, and of every part of the herds, and of the herds, and of every sort of cattle, and of every sort of cattle.

The camp chief Wipin Kumar Kingdom Training Activists are offering their special support.
Callson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Former editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, has been accused of using a so-called secret information about his intentions while being a home secretary of Charles Clark.
Agent Andrew Addis Q.C. told Old Balli that News of the World had heard a bad rumor in May 2005 that Clark was being very special consultants of his own.
The court said that the newspaper appointed the private examiner Glen Mulcheyer to hack the Polby's Voysmail and keep that male 3 nurse, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Eddy said that Mr. Addison suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of N.T.W., doesn't know how to stand outside the people's house and watch them, but they keep people's review articles, see what people react to him.
They said that N.O.T.W. used three ways to investigate matters: phone handling, surveillance and income.
The third included the editors himself.
Obviously he knew about other ways of prevention, he must have known.
What about the former?
Did he know about phone hacking?
They say, no, we say, yes, they knew exactly.
Afha was presented the first time by A.O.T.W.'s feature desk, when Mr. Polby said a source of romantic approval: - Don't waste time, he's with Charles.
From the house of Mulkley in August 2006, at least three times a voicemail tape was suspended from the house, Mr. Polby's phone.
The investigators also found entries in the private tester's computer on which Mr. Polby and his sister were named \"project\".
At the time they were being tested, Mr. Paulby's grandfather called for information about them by anonymous calls.
Meanwhile, former main reporter Ne Willi Tturlbek and former reporter James Weatherup saw Mr. Paulby's arrival.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson told them by means of a Voysmail: “I have found a store that we are planning to run tomorrow, which I definitely want to talk to Charles.
Mr. Addis said that being involved in this case is in a party with other important individuals, such as former home secretary David Blanct.
The judge heard on Thursday that Colson spoke to Mr. Blancet about romantic relations with a married woman, while he was seeing the case of co-resistant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at that time.
Colson and Brooks refused to disagree with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 200. to 9th 2006.
Mulcheyer, Turbuque, and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.

Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter reported on the American commercial embassy at Frankfort, Germany's financial capital.
In order to protect the Constitution, the mission was to take pictures of the U.S. square roof, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of Lissing Antona and signaled an exchange action between the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the United States and Berlin.
James Clepper, director of the American National Cupea, stressed that the United States of America was of its foreign qualia capabilities to steal the business secrets of foreign firms and to increase their international competitiveness or increase the line below them.
But since Edward Snowden, a stakeholder who has made Visalbover, started to tell the American surveillance of his mystery, the leaders of the European government and the business world are no longer sure that the director has not followed his word.
The U.S. National Security Agency reported that Brazil’s oil company was spying on Petrobras and with our Cloud Providers Google and Yahoo and Yahoo, and Yahu feared the state.
The last thing came when it found out that Chancellor Angela Marcel was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be focused, certainly the leaders of the business world are also targeting potential.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between American Kufi services and companies transparent.
I think it would be practical to use these data for a variety of purposes.
“ The Germanic wake must be taken, ” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized German IT firms.
According to a survey published by the German firms Consultancy in July, the United States has almost become a major risk, like China, when it comes to stealing industrial spyies and data.
Lick by Mr. Snowden in all the documentation, however, there is still no evidence that the United States went to the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Governments have expressed concern over the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union’s internet capacity, and it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
The rulers of the commercial world doubt this.
In the German Parliament, someone said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
The president of the German commercial software company SAP, Haso Platener, said, “This is no way.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he would not have to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany comes from coal, from car, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
As to U.S. technologists and spies arrive, the bright snoden has been exposed as a threat to some companies who previously believed are China’s greatest surveillance threat
A major change is taking place in the Cloud Computing Department where the European authorities are more aware that the data stored in the United States is subject to that authority and therefore become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey published by Cloud Security Alliance, a business agency, some 10 Palestinian non-American members of the U.S. planned to use an American based Cloud provider after opening up about the Data Price Khan program.
Jim Snabe, chief executive with SAP, says: “We saw a new question that didn't come to customers a year ago.
Many German authorities argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and therefore be protected at every price.
It's not a surprise that's financial spy.
It's always happened.
-It's a topic for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing changes.
The American commercial and industrial level spys on us and we do, as it is in the national interests to protect our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not willing to protect the system and this is an advantage for attackers.
For big companies, there's been a long time to record messages even if it's not easy to leave one in the home business by taking usb stick, or leaving a laptop beanah in a hotel room is not easy to say at least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Car Maker Audi, says it's a year old system to gather mobile phones before the board meetings because they can't be used as remote gold equipment
While Germany's BfV executive, smart phones are compromised by risking overseas visits, he advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles.
The prepaid mobile phones were reopened.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring it is a concern.
In Germany, it's avenging in several company global markets in particular.
1 small and medium size firms often lack experience, employees and financial resources to protect corporate secrets in an effective way against unauthorized access, and BfV warns in a report.
The United States has warned about the financial spy of its own companies by other countries.
According to the French The Washington Post, the U.S. National Cuphia in February was named after Russia and Israel behind China, which is a second tier of criminals involved in the financial notice in hacking.
According to a German blue chip company board member, when the thing comes to financial spying, 15 French are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, French Internal Cuphia Agency DCRI, reports in the preceding prime minister: “The services are well known to all the countries they support in the non-intervention war, spying on their allies.
The American commercial and industrial level spys on us and we do, as it is in the national interests to protect our business.
No one made a fool.
‘Anochi accident’ is believed to have been killed by the parents of a Georgian teenager who died in 2011.
A youth from Georgia who was found dead in his high school mat in Jim believes that his son was murdered, the family's official said this to Thursday.
Valdosta, G.A. Kendrick Johnson was found to be trapped in a mat standing straight behind the Bleachers in his high school gym on January 11, in the middle of his high school gym.
Researchers from Londons County Sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in a ‘unusual accident', but the 17-year-old boy's family refused it.
Benjamin Crump, who presented Keneth and Jacqueline Johnson, said to Fox News Dotcom that they fully believe their son was murdered.
They are not completely trusted in death in the way Sheriff told them.
Crump said that they believe this is beyond the logic of physical law and general wisdom.
They think that the conclusion is an excuse for the security of individuals or people responsible for their son's death.
He said they sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag.
The U.S. Prime Minister Michael Pirate told Thursday that he was doing a formal investigation about Johnson's death, seeing that many important questions are ignored.
What was the cause of death?
Did his murder account for any crime?
Mure said these words at a journalist conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, and they will lead us wherever we are.
My purpose is to bring the truth to the surface.
He thinks there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation.
Moore said to the reporter that the antiviral breath test indicates that Johnson's death was the result of a physical respiratory crisis.
According to Moore, a second breath test revealed a different reason for death.
He has many questions, which should be answered or confirmed.
Moore also said that if he finds enough testimony to request a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or to examine citizen rights, he will say to the FBI to do it.
Representatives were not immediately available to comment from the office of London's County Sheriff on Thursday.
On Wednesday, South Georgia's judge ordered the majority to release all surveillance videos that were reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope video footage will give some indications of how he died.
CDE issued children's allergic orientation for schools
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for controlling children's food allergies at school.
These guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government for the first time, as the number of children suffering from food allergies from school going to school is increasing.
Now one of every 20 children in the US has food allergies.
The CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, there have been 18 percent increase in food allergies in children.
In this direction, schools report how teachers and staff should be informed about children's food allergies, and how, in the case of an allergic reaction, should be managed.
Studies have also been suggested that they possibly keep a stock of epinephrine to deal with the survival intensity (anaphroxis), which is the auto-injector of the Epiphany brand, which is the most commonly used.
The state council has recently updated the rules, which allow schools to easily store a stock of epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
The children can say, it seems that something's kissing in my tongue, and it sounds like it's hair on my tongue, or my tongue's slicking.
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children's 'ling Unsorted'
Germany has become the first country of European Union, who has adopted third gender for children born with insomnia.
Now newborns will no longer be prescribed in a conservative way either a man or a woman.
According to the new law, parents do not need to pronounce genders for such children, this law allows them to be ‘default’ to the child's birth certificate of evidence.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce pressure on parents who can quickly take gender-specificization decisions related to blood-checking for newborn children, and fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to B.B.C., an intersex man said years later, or not me man, nor woman.
I'll be the junkie, made by practitioners.
According to estimates, every year one of the two thousand children is a child who is neither a child nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under test of sexual development disorders, is the common word used for abnormal characteristics, genetics (individual or growth), or exceptionally developed gender.
Maybe there's Alice Simpson Intersex.
Gender identification is still not considered properly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify gender when it cannot be gender-specific and to perform surgery, if such a novel comes, monitor the child's psychological and physical development before it can't be sexual.
The New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Dresher, who is a specialist in sex-purchasing matters, said that Germany's new law seems to be good things.
Intersex children develop moral insecurity.
He said, ‘Some people are in such a state of life-society that requires surgery, but most children do not.
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how to develop a gender in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer about why.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In 2011 the report entered by the European Commission, intersex people are described as differently from transclusive or transgender people, because their status is not related to gender but is related to its biological structure, which is neither a man nor a woman but both are united or neither is clearly defined.
These characteristics can display self-determination of secondary sexual trends, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, chest and length; reproductive organs and genitals such as primary sexual impulses; or quality structure and hormonal structure.
The report provides an example of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of employees, as well as of persecution, violence and discrimination.
Now there are special camps for non-commercial sex boys.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed older people to mark men, women, or other genders on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby, life-to-life-less - Uncertainty - The legal appeal to keep gender status became the world's first recognition-free - non-sexual people.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the German passport will also have a third specification as X for intersex persons except M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, the issues related to gender in neighboring countries in France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed the school's books to the 2ling principle to go back to.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also resisted this law of Germany, since the world is going into a state where gender itself is the choice, but not sexual activity, we are leading the two other columns of civilization in the opposite direction.
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn child also told Baby John that she would like to see the children being given sex when they were born.
He said on the website, without the extra limits, it's very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is.
Children need stability and determination.
Historically, children born with both men and women were called Hermafroidites (unsexually), who were named after the beautiful Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered gender as a slate that was removed and could be written again.
But now many people are challengeing the morals of surgery, they understand that sex-making is complex work, and sometimes even practitioners, who don't know what the children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
Dresher says that in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a manorog emergency.
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychologist, you called the surgeon-chick.
The current theory regarding the treatment of babies who are disabled was presented by Dr. John Mani at the University of John Hopkins, who considered gender to be well-organized.
He’s adhesive. He created the word and argued how social and environmental sign-parents adopt the child - interacting with the child's genes and hormonals to determine whether he should be recognized as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, known as the 1Jon/Joan, their theories became controversial.
He suggested that a child who had been involved in an accident during the gender-distression, have to be fully bound to the child and be like her red-pound girl.
Dresher said, \"Mani presented the matter as a successful case of the situation, but it didn't.
In 15 years of age, the child turned himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that still some practitioners are following the representation.
But in the years since 1990, with the advent of the Internet, these sex surgeons began to come face-to-face, not happy.
The same case was with Montana's 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with the X.Y. male factor, but his generation was unclear.
Doctors didn't understand clearly that his gender was small, or his fiancé was big, but they were sure he could never live as a man.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and egg cells were fired and he was raised as a female.
She was given a female hormonal at 12 years of age.
She said to ABCNews.com, and I knew I wasn't a girl.
I wasn't happy, but it was too hard to question.
At 18 years of age, she was about to have a virus.
But feeling confused and confused, she asked for medical archives.
This made him aware of the terrifying truth.
At the time of my birth, I was bound - and no one ever told me.
Bruce had been born with DSD, who prevented his body from producing enough testosterones, which did not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, she took testosterone's scar and removed her breast.
He was confused because of the blood-diagnosis.
Today, he explains his views on intersex individuals in an interface project.
However, the law of Germany is called the Chillipi-based legislative group Advocates for Informationed Chaisss.
They say, “Many activists think Germany's law will prompt parents to decide quickly and to specify the child.
We're afraid it'll encourage the intervention.
Instead of waiting, it's a better process to specify either a man or a woman's sex.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Matis said that his organization supports Australian law because it allows adults to be recognized in third gender.
He said that adults should be able to make their own decisions about technical gender.
Germany's law relates to specifying it at birth.
It's not the battles that are fought by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions related to their bodies.
But Pittsberg's breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Bartz, whose daughter has sexual development disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law will give both parents and children power.
Baratzi's daughter, Katy, was born with males, but she had a complete endogen incompetent disorder called DSD.
Because his endogen was in error in Grey, women in Kati developed antics.
His body has Jonah, but there is no contraceptive or dembgress.
Now Kate is married 29 years old and rezident in the Child psychology Department at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she's barren, she expects to be a mother by either taking a bull or by means of a gastal sergosi.
Baratz said, \"This law allows parents to make their own decisions quickly.
It provides them with the proper understanding and time by a few tests before writing 'man' or 'woman'.
In this way, you stay well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely kid and have fun with him.
We don't have to be quick enough to do any surgery that can't be returned.
He said, \"It brings children in the process of decision making and frees them from the hostiles that inspire parents because they don't believe they're doing well.\"
Finally, the child will determine which gender she is more easily with -- and that would be very nice.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
The legal awareness camp was held in the Middle School of Ramangar, in the president of the Committee's Cheerman and Ramminger's Cheermangar, by Hersil Legal Service Committee.
It provided students and others with the authority of education and financial knowledge of the law for the generation.
In the camp, Advocate ML secreta, Rohin loads, and Serapach kept people talking about it.
A large number of villagers were present on the program.
Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to New York Times, the closest consultants of President Barack Obama undercover thought of Hillary Clinton at the position of President Kelley Biden for 2012.
The most notable threat in the mystery is that Mark Halperin and John Hellemon have been a massive 2012 campaign tom, 1WW: Change the game 2012.
Times received a copy of the Agama book and reported that the president's top counsellors could help to find out whether Obama's fall in the hope of re-election in hopes of getting organized in the year 2011.
According to the Times National Political Communicationr Jonathan Martin, the book goes on to explain the entire information in the campaign of major authorities and put the main bill of East White House staff for the name of the former state secretary Clinton on the change poll.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the basic structures of the Chicago campaign and within the Oval Office.
Only half the president's close advice was found, including the former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and the former White House senior consultants David Axlord and David Pluoffe were asked to change.
-Double down - claims that Dalit tried to change Biden, despite their personal schedule, when they were finally informed that Clinton’s tickets would not improve Obama’s situation.
In a witness with Martin, Lakne has confirmed that the administration was actually considering Clinton's place with Biden.
-I told the whole view, and one of them was.
You remember, when the president was in danger at that time, we were in such a situation. Holy Christ, what else we would do.
While Dachni told the research to be careful, Martin had told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the election campaign was then making significant investments to find out how much the price would pay for the poll.
The campaign doesn't spend voting and focused groups like Paso until they are seriously considering something, Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, Halaki, did Obama know what their team was looking for?
Martin told CNN that his boss knew about possible adjustments?
While Dachan said that they didn't seem to know the president about the possible change.
3Double down. Sure: Can't answer the political investigation and put it on Obama's desk? Martin said more.
Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama did not know about binden dumping ticket research.
-Well, maybe, Martin said.
Like Glo-Ind-Dark Ice Cream?
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first use of the Glo-in-Dank Ice Cream - jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has benefited greatly from the sea animals to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came after reading a search letter on jellyfish, and China's incredible scientists used chemical glowing to relight the protein.
Ice cream will increase the pH of the protein by reacting with the tongue that eats that tongue, and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says that ice cream is sparked by reacting with the heat of mouth, i.e. winning, it will become more exciting.
Charlie, founder of Lyk Mei M. Delissius ice cream company, said: \"This is incredible but the production of the early days will get about 2 grams of stuff.\"
The protein that we're using in ice cream will react with neutron pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We've been experimenting for the past few months and it's been quite fair to share it on Halloween because it gives a wonderful glowing effect.
This may be the most expensive ice cream that has been made of corn because the light of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
Even though the icco taste is very good.
It is well known for the unique tastes of a practical company, beer, cheese, meat and gold, based in Charlie's Bristol.
But his next design will prove to be even more significant.
He said: ‘I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.
It's natural impossible because of ice crystals that make up ice cream above, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of a self-regulated quality of a jellyfish, which is synthesized by Chinese scientists
The Queen's garden market had a full market with customers.
It was recently that people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy the furniture.
This was recently in the Central Market of Wajirpur, Initiary Rohani, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Pacific Vihar.
Some of these were found to be at the Sarafa shops of Pemapura, Ashok Vihar, Modal Town.
And the people took gold, and silver, and gold, and silver, and silver.
Because of this, other markets, including the external ring road, were jammed.
However, people from the office had to spend hours in jams to get home.

Prakash merchants have been trapped in the fun after the Hycourt order.
Neither are they now able to do business at the temporary patcha market made in Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses for business in Transport Area.
The commission, founded by Punjab and Hariana Highcourt, declared unsafe to the temporary patcha market located in Ranjit Avenue during his visit.
Because there was no proper arrangement there, he would have caused the captain of the impregnator's ship to be punished for a million dollars.
Hycourt assembled the administrative authorities of the U.S. in his orders and said that the administration could not even solve a problem for a nine-year-old merchant.
They could not be available in the city.
Then, with proper security provision, the pateca traders were asked to issue a license for the transaction in the market where the ship is located.
After the order, good-bye merchants were happy, but on their happiness, the police turned the water back on Friday.

In a cave, 50 feet from the ground was called to save a missing puppy on the face of a troubled mountain
Cooker Spaniard Ruby had fled after arriving in a small street tract
Three days later he was caught in the pit by a Doug Walker
Fireworks brought down the front of the rock to protect the dog from death
After he had been caught up in the face of a troubled mountain by Puppy in a way that was fifty feet above the ground, he had a pleasant life.
Nine months after Cooker special Ruby arrived on Sunday afternoon, he fled to a road trick and went alone for 3 days before he was rescued from the treasure.
Their owners, Scott Elderson, 25, and their girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denhom, were at the Flappit Khan in West Yorkshire to meet again, and have blessed the West Yorkshire fires and rescue services.
After he fled after a small accident, he had searched for his lost dog like crazys, and appeal was posted on social networking sites.
On Wednesday morning, at 2.15 p.m., a bright-looking Doc Walker saw Ruby, 50 feet from the ground, on top of the mountain.
A technical rescue team from the Clekhiton Fire Station arrived at the event station and dropped down by the Russia to save Ruby and used a pet tube to bring it down from the rock.
“He was in a critical situation, ” said Specialist Protection Officer Andy Clayton.
It was in the middle of the rock, 50 feet from top and bottom.
He didn't do anything during rescue, that stone was built.
But now he's good.
Then she was eating biscuits.
It was a very unusual call for help.
In fact, it's incredible to see the dog.
The Special Technique rescue officer Peter Law said: \"Rubi has escaped in a lucky way.\"
It was likely to be seriously hurt or even worse.
Ruby was taken to a animal doctor for testing, where he found better than hard and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Helifax, Western Yorkshire, said: “It was terrible to see the work.
For before, I didn't believe how he came there.
It's amazing to get him back into your hands.
The animal doctor said that if she was too tired and fallen, she would surely fall down.
The firefighter did a great job.
What they did is really very brave work.
We are their vanity, and they were all perfect.
From Kigali, Mr. Elderson also said: \"We were afraid she could fall, but she stayed there.
The firefighter did a great job.
I don't believe how he got there.
Mike Jaeger says that when Katie was 18 years old, she didn't hit her.
During a witness with the Australian radio show this week, Pon Star said he had sung back to the 2004 song of Jaeger, \"Old Habits Day Hard\".
Perry said he had dinner with senior rocker, and ‘When I was 18, they hit me.
He said that this thing was old, and he deals well with me.
The 70-year-old Jager's representative told Thursday in a statement that he clearly refused to hit the 3KAT foot ever.
The representative also said: \"Pari, of course, is talking about someone else's misunderstanding.

George Kereven: Euro decay gave the Scots an option
Another Day, Another Story of Fear of Freedom
This time we have been warned that it would require free Scotland to be involved as a free travel area throughout Europe as a state of membership.
Passport control on Burwick and on Hadrien's walls point to stories about the boundaries of the firmed wire.
True, the Strathclide Paper described the potential economic benefits of free income with the rest of Europe, though it has not been described in the Headlines.
No one described that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their requirements.
Since Scotland is no longer the Shuggen area, the Brussels will always be cheap for non-profit Brussels instead of receiving anything he really wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Qahani.
And what's been a long time since, it's got. First of all, I mean freedom, passport control.
Yet this interesting old story lost an interesting point to repeat.
Why should you expect Europe to be bilingual from free Scotland anyway?
Why do London's Yok for Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great, war-fashioned scheme to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, Project Europe has officially died.
Throughout the U.S., groups dedicated to combating the EU or as similar currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptil Alternative for Germany - which has been founded this year - suddenly came and gained almost fifty million votes in the organizational election of September, and thus effectively drove free democracies (as equivalent to our Lib Dems).
There has always been domestic opposition to the plans to build Union Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, proved to be a real change.
Along with the strict rules imposed by the Berlin and European Central Bank, many people have had to think that the project Europe has gone too far away because of obstacles to follow similar currency.
This was only true in the case of Greece, in the case of Greece, in the extreme budget loss of national governments.
Instead, the Euro system fixed its members' currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of domestic currency indisputation, South Europe finds itself in a damaging position of productivity, compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public income - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
More than current budgets and currency problems are high European productivity patient.
In order to provide relief for French and German energy firms on the use of consumers - brazels were put out. As a result of energy policies, the European industry doubles power for the United Nations and pays four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
It's the cost to pay, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even the world's paid fees, European petroleums cannot save the industry from being affected by cheap U.S. shell gas.
As a result, there is a feeling of revolt among people, especially in France, who had once been the prime praise of the EU.
After the rise, France's top politicians saw the U.S. as a solution to controlling Germany, and giving Paris the world equal billing.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has applied its own economic policies to Europe, causing the French economy to collapse.
The result: Marin Lee Penn's southernmost, E.U. anti-National Front has recently won the ruling Socialist at the third place in the subjunctive.
At this time, France has the most popular team with 24 percent of vote - it's the time for the British Labor to warn that they can't walk by believing that dissociation for the left is going to benefit itself, to the right.
What is Lee Penn Francesie doing with his newfound fame in the middle of the working class?
The team wants to use the U.U. elections that are next year to make the most anti-universal currency groups in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, the U.U. anti-racist parties display well in these elections, this kind of Google can first affect the European Parliament.
My point of view is this: Soon in Europe, the combination of the eUU and the most anti-high currency feelings will end Euro.
The Euro will not be complete, but it will break. Europe of the nations will come back in some way to support General De Gall.
Germany and some of its acceptable economys can keep Euros, but France and Southern Europe will reopen their currency.
I expect the U.K. will keep itself away from this project in hopes of developing relationships with the U.S.
However, the growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland?
We can choose to be part of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better in the slow European system, as if we keep our own currency.
In Europe of non-national nations, it would be easy to work together with other similar thinking countries.
Otherwise we should consider keeping our economic freedom on the way to Norway.
In Scotland, the S.N.P. government - is the most successful anti-professional political campaign in Europe, which has won a wonderful privilege in 2011 by the chancellor Eliser Darling of Leber, who was a member of the Chancellor and followed by the Tori-lib Dem Assembly.
It would be rude for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that situation it would have to accept the rules of the immigration imposed by Berlin and Brussels.

Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls acquire sex at an early age compared to their age's gory girls.
Physical change does not mean that sex is compatible
There is no testimony that hormonal or other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity can be a factor in low age
Before time, sexual matters are not as effective in boys
CNN's former conversational reporters are specialists in the health and family issues of Pat Etheriz children.
Should the mother be worried if the breast development and birth of the genitals begin in her daughter at the age of 7 or 8?
This week in Orlando, Florida, U.S. Child Medicine Endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz made it clear that these initial physical changes are common among American girls, these are new trends.
Kaplowitz says, \"I spend a lot of time giving the impression that it usually doesn't show rapid progress in the direction of full-time sex.\"
The direct symptoms of development, such as breast-feeding, appear to be in the early stages of birth and hair and physical smell girls.
But in the past four decades, there has been a significant change in the age of Reverend (first magazine).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
-When the breast begins to develop, the first routine takes at least two to three years.
It's the most accurate test time for the development of sex.
It's debated about what sex starts, but when breast development develops before 8 years of age, two say it's a child-growth.
In most cases, the process will be slow or stopped - which child physicians can look closely at.
In a more rapid progress situation, tests may be needed by the endocrineologist to eliminate the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or syst.
There are treatments to delay time-to-date menstrual and other effects: the time-old age of the bones, which may cause unresolved growth and obesity.
Customs, child's age, development rates, growth rates, and emotional obesity depend on treatment for drug or hormonal therapy.
Psychiatric aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is aware of drugs but admits, pressure on Yawn can increase behavioral issues, and girls may begin to feel different from their peers.
The other big problem is: the parent doesn't just want the daughter of their younger age to have a menstrual status.
Kaplovitz said, the 10th are concerned about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene.
A woman whose daughter had started a menstrual religion at the age of 10 recalls: it was a shock.
Although there were signs of this and we also talked about psychology, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She was afraid of her school and returned to troubled that she had started the first menstrual religion in her peers.
There are many well-known principles about the causes of unwanted sex.
Still, there is no constant evidence that sexual messages can be charged with hormon, chemicals in the environment, or media.
Boys are receiving time-old sex just like girls.
Caplowittz defines the rule that its main cause is the plague of stability.
In 2001, he helped conduct studies on girls aged 6 to 9 years old, which connects body fat to sexual time.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanic girls tend to have sex before their age-old girls.
There are a lot of clearances on this.
At global levels, the representation of time-old sexuality, from economic conditions to weather and genes, appears to be affected by everything.
Other puzzles: Even though the boys are getting the children's face and the children are at a low age, they are not as clear as the girls are.
Other practitioners attending the AAP conference supported the complexity of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it is common to see the hair of the young men, and the hair of the people.
Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child physician at the Goreb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, says that we need to be careful about how we identify the actual start of the youth.
The parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to discuss how to talk to their children.
Kaplowitz advised, this means you can talk before the expected time.
If you're calm, your child will usually answer correctly.
Girls developing from time to time need to be assured that it is going to be past the time but it is part of normal life.
The barbare was dropped to 3.1 degrees Celsius at temperature.

The mighty went out to the streets and to their destination by wearing sweaters.
People have also taken the fare when the winter rains were first rain.
In the morning, the people saw the sun.
As the weather changes, there will be plenty of relief from work and disease, but after that the cloud continues to cover the camp.
The children also got to their school by wearing sweaters.
There, according to the Airfors Weather Department, the atmosphere had a maximum temperature of 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
While 7.8 millimeters were dropped.
According to the weather department, there will be clouds on the sky.
With a dispute for seat width at the largest Orders of jet creators.
It seems a hole in setting up a wave for this month's double Arsho for long distance flights between front flights for the wide range of tourists-class seats
The controversy is focused on the wide range of the Economy class in flights, not always given by Airlines but, as the Latest Jets Airbus SAS and Boeing Company have claimed to be the key.
Erbus is expected to provide an extensive seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in this week's economy cabin but it should be determined by the Airlines to be his prime-represented Boeing.
The controversy comes between the pilot and the pilot after the event of 17-21 when it became the starting point to sell a long distance of Ercraft's bounding engine.
How has the previous section of the plane been created-- that's especially what seating is 9 or 10 is making the design of mini-gembo jets in view of the greater capacity?
Boeing says it's 477 X, which will place 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 times in a row.
Airbus says walking with A350, it'll take 350 people up to a seat of 18 inches left.
The airlines often carry business on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, Airbus 77 hopes to be hit by more than 100 Orders in the double Arsho with 77 X, this further appeals to the public.
Recently it's been seen that the wake of the war has started with anything in the beginning of the war. Will you accept it at the same rate at the same time?
Airbus sales chief, John Lehi, is offering a long distance flight from the 11boing regional turbo.
As a change, people are getting big, but the way to sit on the plane is not changed.
According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Health, during the 1970 ’ s, Boeing 747 Zambone defined a modern long journey to the past, and at the age of 40 - 49, U.S.A., an average of 40 - 49 - year - old American males, me 10 percent.
According to the American Health Statistics, the average American man's waist is 39.7 inches in the 21st century.
Airbus says that its opponent is chipped by a seat estimate in 1950 when the new name was the average unit of 6jet set.
Airbus says that the U.S. Research Commission has set up to suggest improvement in the quality of sleep in the width of the seat, an additional amount of 53 feet in the width of the seat.
Boing argued on the frequency of the airbus seat measure, and it has said that it does not depend on the decision of creators how Airlines balance between renters and facilities.
It also says, research shows that more than one seat width depends on cabin experience.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Krewer said that it is actually to provide airlines with flexibility and the things they believe they need to do to succeed.
They don't want to tell us what benefit they're from.
They know better about their business in comparison to someone else.
For flyers, it's about the cooking room, but for suppliers it's a point that it can affect I.
The business of at least $700 billion behind this issue is estimated in the decades that the aircraft's competition is enough to tip the US and European exports.
Reiter's report stated for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually a battle point between new jet planes.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that each seat has been operating for 20 percent of their new link to engine design by leader of that volume, 365-site Boeing 777-300 hr.
Boeing's claim of display depends on the 10th 77 X wild root compared to the 777th design.
The unit cost is equal to 10 times the comparison is now used.
Kevin Kenisston, the head of the Airbus travel facility in Europe, says that it's his plane, along with our products, to make more competitors and more seats.
On the other hand, analysts say that the whole 10-sit-line cabin currently suggests that many passengers have the Denser layout side by side, which can go along with the cheap rent.
Kevin's inner specialist, Mary Corby, founder and editor's runway girl network, said. Eighteen-inch seat wide passengers will be very nice, but in fact this business point of Airbus is conducted by the threat of 777.
Airbus and Boying seats don't supply but provide a list of providers for Airlines.
Even world-wide jet vendors should be careful to check these layouts on competition.
With more rest, all the builders were also giving high-density layouts for low cost of jet aircraft services and regional travel.
Airbus giving this is 10 equals A350 but says it's not worth it right now.
But until recently, the Airbus emphasized some of its jet planes' wide cabin seats to need more cabin facilities.
It's not possible for a new industry to fly on standard without the support of modern jet planes but it can distract from the wave of 777 X sales.
New Anti-Nitamine Vaxin can end the enjoyment of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-cytokine vaccine that can end the fun meeting with smoking.
The same cracks of the Vyxin were capable of protecting the rats from nicotine’s rhythm for the whole life.
Before testing is started on man, there is a need for further testing, which may take several years, but in New York, Professor Ronald Crystal, professor of the Wyl Cornel Medical College, said that antisocial signals are positive.
Professor Cornell said that, we hope this kind of vaccine can eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market today, but they found that their blood of nicotine, is much more powerful than these current methods.
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, designed to bring genetic information to the purpose of creating anti-nucleotide antibiotics.
This virus, selectively infects the infected cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibiotics.
Antibodies search for any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevent the smoker from raising up nicotine in the inside of the smoker by injecting them into the brain before they reach the brain.
In testing, the vaccines given rats that were later given nicotine, they continued to perform their normal activities.
Researchers say, but the dog who was not given a vaccine felt good. It was a sign that Nicotine had reached his brain.
The use was described in a journal called Science Translational Medicine.
Vaxines of the former tobacco had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be cracked on a regular interval so that the antibiotic levels could remain, but it proved costly and unnecessary.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be great, as the hack will make the cell a factory of antibiotics.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is fully safe, it can be given to children before smoking, before they can be saved from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
He said he will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy smoking because of Nicotine's vaccine, which can help save their habit.
British scientists were interesting to the results, but warned of the need for more research.
Even after the postmartum, the real cause of Baghkin's death could not be raised.
The Forest Department gives a roundup answer to this, the first insight is giving natural meaning to Baggin's death.
On Thursday night, the wild workers of the Ramanggar Forest had found a tiger's corpse near the old Conservation Range River.
All the body of the tiger was safe, and there was no signs of injury or injury on her.
On Friday, the forest guardian conscience Pande, the CTR's deputy Sakat Budola, the DFO, was posted to post the tiger's remains in the presence of the SDO G.S. Karki, the presence of the CTR's animal physician, and Kotabag's animal physician, Hema Rattore.
As for the sources, the inner body of the garden is being told to be bad during the postmartum.
This did not know why Baghkin's real deaths were caused.
At Bagkin's death, department officials were responding to Golmal.
Yet IVIRAI's inner organs have been sent to the topsycolological investigations that are to confirm the tide.
The forest guardian's western attitude was informed by the conscience Pande that Babylon's death could be called natural.
The tiger's corpse has not given any signs of the roots.
Yet it is also being sent to the Bisara investigation for confirmation of the area around it.
We are being impressed by the tripodi obide.
Former NSW labor minister JoA tripodi will be tested by State Corporation Watchdog.
East NSW labor minister JoA tripodi refused to pay for his political teacher Eddie Obide's request of the East New South Wales guardian Eddie Obide, who was willing to hide in the government-controlled three land mines.
The independent organization against corruption (ICAC) was widely investigated on Friday, whether Mr. OBED for violations of parry's papers of policy by several state ministers? where two restaurants and cafe, owned by OBED's owner, were released without Tennder's release in August 2005.
After the testimony given to Thursday by Lin Ashpole, East Sub Chief of Staff, Mr. Tripodi knew Mr. Obide's hidden selfishness?
In 2005, during the years of discussion, the government had pressured the public Tender to start the fences.
The stripers were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the paper's Enterprise for the Boards, which OBED earned $25 million, was released from a non-capitarian container.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of the Gates from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in party to the Public Tender.
But they refused to change on Mr. Obide's request, Mr. Tripodi had requested a change of government strips policy.
In a phone call, the document was presented on ICAC May August and September 2007, Mr. OBED and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to Mr. OBED's opinion department after serving the Ministry.
Assistive Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi, what was being discussed in the telephone conversation regarding the development of commercial policy.
-No, Mr. Tripodi answered.
I discussed what I couldn't remember, but it definitely wasn't.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
The authorities said that Israeli combat planes had shouted in Syria.
The Israeli warships targeted the port city of Latakia in Syria on Thursday night, a senior administrative officer confirmed that Fox News.
The officer didn't tell what purpose was, but there was at least one purpose.
A report from the Associated Press states that Targate was a Russian missile SA-125.
Israel has already attacked missiles within Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can meet the test
The government considers a qualification for foreign workers on 457 Vija, as its purpose is to extend a harsh action.
If taken, this test will be applied through a standard designed to prevent families and friends from being used in Australia by the purpose of blocking 457.
Today, a government discussion letter was issued, condemning the government's veterinary coverage of foreign employees, former Labor MP Maxine MacQ said today that it could corrupt Australia's neighboring countries.
He told the United States Indian Institute today that the foreigners are reaching the end of the Qatar and 13 Australians have a strong opinion about the job before.
Historically, it meant that white workers should be granted protection - and if some people in the field saw that historic testimony, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion letter shows the outline of 12 measures, which was previously considered by former Ministry of Affairs Chris Bowen.
The immigration minister Brendan O'Conner who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with the authorities about the people who were paying taxes, has implemented five contract changes, while the rest are asked.
If the certificate is adopted, the visa application may be examined in the case of a case where the nomination is true in situations with the reputation of the person, the owner or the personal friend of the veja provider.
Businesses may need to calculate the number of 457 veja streams, because the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor the low number of workers took hundreds of people to work.
Meanwhile, 35-year-old Sri Lankai refugees were simple, this week after Christmas arrived in a refugee's name on Iceland, dying of a painful heart attack.
The man's nine-year-old son had come to Australia on his journey with him, and on Wednesday, after his father's death, an elderly cousin has covered the same pot.
Australian officials brought the man to Christmas Island hospital where he died.
The HS2 railway project by the British government has been announced to increase the benefits of Scotland.
Works by HS2 indicate high speed services in the north of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transport minister Barones Kremer stated that the project would become one of the British.
Keith Brown, the transit minister of Scotland, said that they are very discouraged by working with the British government on this project.
The first step will include new high speed rail lines between London and West Midlands.
Once the second step is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Lead.
In June, the government filed the cost of creating a high speed link between London and Northern England at £32.7 Billion by modifying £42.6.
The British government, who was communicating with Scotland transport, directed the HS2 Limited to consider rail capacity for North England and Scotland and the possibility of improving travel time.
It involves the possibility of three hours or less possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
According to Barrenez Kremer: Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We're moving forward with HS2, because the benefits will be much greater.
Without it, we will face problems related to our power of rail networks.
But this is also about the connectivity of 18 British cities with Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be more closely connected with HS2.
According to Scottish secretary Eliser Carmikel: The announcement is good news for Scotland today.
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmicle in Scotland’s HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: \"High speed rail is likely to have heavy economic benefits to Scotland, but this will also increase the economic burden of Scotland in the whole of Britain in terms of high speed rail.
So we are excited to work in partnership with the British government, so that we can bring higher speed rails in Scotland, create benefits for everyone, and check options for completion of the Glasgow-Edeenberg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I'm willing to review the investigation report with British government ministers the following year and make decisions together on further action.
Air electric equipment regulations will now be effective in Australia.
In the US, it must continue to shut down your teblet and smart phones while flying Australian Airplane passengers and air landings.
The US Union Air Administration has left the option open to changing its processes to American air service companies, so that travel e-book will be able to read, watch video or play game on their equipment, while the rest remain in the 3Wuan mode.
Travelers can do this right now during a lot of flights, but it seems unlikely that many people would be unable to reach their eBooks etc while flying and landing the plane.
Australian air service companies are considering the decision, as US air service companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have signaled that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
Citizen aircraft security authority also said that he was thinking about the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of electricity in important steps of flight in Australia are still effective.
- Currently, CASA has no special regulations that govern the output of electric devices in the plane, said the Authority. This issue comes under regulations, which ensure the aircraft service operations companies have always been made up of, and passengers must follow the security guidelines given by the driver team members.
Virginia, who has already talked with CASA about extending the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is willing to follow this change, but she said to proceed to Winimak's direction.
The spokesman said that we will welcome reviews by CASA to allow the use of electricity, because we really think it will give customers better experience, because now we have (Wireless In-Flight Entertainment) on our planes.
Quantas said it would now follow the current rules.
He said that, according to our current policy, electricity cannot be used during the flight and landing of the plane, and we have no immediate plan to change it.
The FAA decisions apply to U.S. Airlines.
In the same way, we are always interested in international developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider FAA's decisions and reasons behind them.
The effect of this decision will be different on every US air service company and will depend on the size of their aircraft.
Air Service companies will need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio activity with mobile devices, as well as research them to provide brief details to their rules, training materials, Carrie-on badge programs and passengers.
The FAA said that after the airlines verify their plane's endurance, he will allow passengers to use light-weight electric devices such as cables, e-readers and smartphones.
In the rare cases of low visibility, drivers will command passengers to shut down their equipment while landing the plane.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment under seat while flying and landing.
The silver of Ponbrockers due to feeling difficulty by middle class in Singapore
In the Bendemier shopping center in Singapore, Amirthlinga is taking her daughter's daughter's school fees to pay for her gold knife, ring, and shuffling.
Mrs. Amirthlinga said, \"My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is trapped in it.
They say, though they earn $3,000 Singapore ($2,400 U.S.), and their husbands work, but the monthly income of the family remains uninhabitable.
In fact, there is a similar demand in South-East Asia -- where domestic loans are growing - Valumax, where they are taking their own transactions, became the third ponshop listed on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
It's not the only way to get the cash to keep the attraction is to get the cash - in case of Sri Lanka, $1300 Singapore -- but almost as cheap as the unsecured bank loon.
Ponbrokers usually charge 17 percent per year in Singapore, which is slightly higher than 15.4 percent offered by the United Oversize Bank, which is a local debt that is branched in the same shopping center.
Ponbrokers, however, have the advantage of not needing a credit check or the amount of payment, and they can make loans more quickly than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are struggling because of the rising cost of living by families and the rise in domestic and consumer debt.
Five years after the global financial crisis, strong growth for five years, and a simple medical policy in developed economys, the lower and middle-age families are struggling to meet their needs because of slowing down their economy.
This week's rating agency, Standards Enge puers, primarily told the growing domestic profit due to growing hostages (Mortz), risking the debt of Asian banks.
It said the highest domestic debt in Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, in Asia.
Malaysia is in the highest position with 80 percent of the GDP, although it was 60 percent in 2008.
In economic Thailand, users are concerned about the high levels of debt, which is a light-as-fashioned week.
On Thursday, data has shown a decrease in export slows and consumer demand.
In Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B., economist Sang Seng Wuun said, \"The unilateral point is that with increased prices, [I passing] people will try to increase their income in every possible way.
In the last two years, historically high values in gold prices have inspired people to put personal property down, because they are taking advantage of the opportunity to miss the value of the attractions of their family.
There are 70 percent of the items dropped in 200 pon outlets of city-state in Singapore.
People say. The sense of gold seems to be nice, let's keep the gold chain of Grandmothers fall down, and take them back the next month.
The Thailand's largest ponshop manager, Ejimani, has seen 20 percent increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in church keeping business that the director of the outlet in Bendimir says 15 others, not just in his neighborhood, are planning to extend to Malaysia, where it has four shops, but even outside Asia, is planning to extend out of it.
The company will finance it using 60 percent of the $66 million received in listing this week on Singapore Stock Exchange.
While high interest rates have been criticized by some diskant Landers, Mr. Yah says that keeping a fall is not only a cheap rate compared to other loans, it does not directly increase in loans.
They say, \"The scholars keep things that they already have, and they don't increase the family debt.
The social acceptance of Ponbroking is increasing to receive short-term and secure financial assistance.
It's not that Ponbrockers use only economically weak individuals.
In Singapore, even the wealthy use the Valumax outlet, they keep the Gold Bar or Rollex Clocks falling so that their purchase price can be paid by 60 percent.
We have customers of all classes of society.
Mr. Yah says, these include rich people who need to borrow for a little time for professional activities or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow requirements.
Sometimes they only need wealth in a short time.

325 Million Protection packages for Tajik health
The Union government has stressed that the healing system in Tasmania has also been associated with harsh conditions with the rescue package of $225 million for the healing system that will ensure that the state government could not be destroyed.
The Union Health Minister Tanya Plybersek has announced that the National, the island state was old-born population, the high rate of chronic illness, and the current crisis to solve the present crisis due to the limits of the system.
During the four years, funding decision was made after the government's approval with the free parliament Andrew Wilki in Tasmania.
Mr. Plybersek said today, \"The government is to the emergency defense package, which we believe will solve the special challenges faced by the state.\"
The 325 Million dollar package also includes an alternative surgery plan for $3 million.
Orthopaedic and Motia-point surgery, including 2600 additional operations, will help solve the previous combined issues.
It also includes good care, medical specialist training, mental health services, and personal electronic health archive systems in Hobart and Lonsestation, better after leaving the hospital.
Mr. Plybersek said, these are the best ways to improve the health system of Tasmania by leading practitioners.
The minister insisted that the Tsmania government would face severe reporting and accountability rule.
The state will have to maintain the current funding level to obtain national wealth, and report each month where additional mandates are being carried out.
Three members will be set up to ensure that the system will be served effectively and effectively by the state.
Mr. Wilki said that the 325 Million dollar would not mean too much, until the actual improvements were made to bring the public health system of Tasmania to a more critical level.
Yet they praised the government to respond to their request for immediate help, which they brought before the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
Mr. Wilki said, \"I hope the organizational assistance package will prove very helpful in the direction of separating the state's public health system from the trouble-list.
According to the state government, these additional alternate processes will mostly restore the recently cutters.
But the National Disadvantages Health spokesman Peter Duton believes that today's announcement is a band-ad solution.
He said to A.B.C. TV, we are here because the Labor State government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You can't believe it as a good news day for about half billion dollars by the state government and $300 million by the National Assembly.
Mr. Dutton requested that Mr. Pleibersek guarantee that one of the save packages would not be spent on the additional jobs.

This declaration of chemical weapons banning organization has been declared a day before the end date of November 1
The Heg-sized organization set Damascuss to combine chemicals in all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and to destroy or make the machine that was used to fill the war material.
mainly to complete the initial stage of destruction, this significant event is a stone of positive mills aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid- 2014.
Destroying the device means Syria can no longer create a new chemical weapon.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapon and collection.
Syria is believed to have 1000 mitric tons of chemicals and weapons, including Mustard Gas and Norway Agent Sirine.
The British state Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that the announcement occurred when Thursday increased in conflict in the city of Saphira, which experts believe is the chemical weapons production unit and the storage center.

The observers said they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said these two centers have been abandoned according to Syria and... the chemical weapons product items placed there were brought to other declared centers.
It wasn't immediately clear whether the unit in Saphira was one of the two centers where the OPC was not able to be monitored.
Syria has presented plans for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which should be accepted by the executive committee of OPCW the following month.
Ahmed Uzumku, a prominent member of the group that is taking care of the OPCW, said, I greet the determination and encouragement you have demonstrated by the people in fulfilling the most challenging mission that this organization has ever done.
For three years, the home war is mainly the government of Assad and its security forces, including members of the rest of the Islam movement, and the struggle between the rebel Sunni Muslims.

The accused then sold the land to millions of dollars.
There, they took Lone on these web documents.
After that, the real owner of the land was threatened by police and administration.
The julian registrar accuseds were particularly concerned with NRIG's lands.

So it's easy to prepare and sell those lands' web registries.
The police commissioner Gil said that the accused reported that he had made up about 150 of the net registries.
According to the police, there are already cases of fraud and stealing against the party.
Crying at the sound of the bomb blast in the sand
In 2002, the 202 parents and partners who were killed in the bombing in 2002 were crying out on the sound given to the bomb blaster, crying that Umar Tak should face the firing team.
The screen, which ran as one of South-East Asian's most wanted people for about 10 years, was heard yesterday for his role in creating the explosive device used in the bomb explosion.
After the parole is given, she can be released in 15 years.
On the 45-year-old Umar, two nightclubs were found guilty of mass murder in Kuta's famous tourist area, including 202 people, including 88 Australians, and a lot of people were injured.
He was also found guilty of several other charges related to terrorism, including the series of bombings committed in the church in Indonesia on the east evening of Christmas in 2000.
The investors had asked for a life sentence, but they could also request that this man be condemned as the master who made the bomber.
The decision restored June Cortin's painful memories of women living in Perth who lost their 39-year-old daughter-in-laws in a destructive attack by her colleagues a decade ago.
Stop your seats, he said that Patak should be sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should have received the same punishment as other terrorists.
Mr. Courtine told the A.P. that he should be set up before the firing team.
I have to live with my grandchildren every day, without my daughters and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, just after 11 o'clock at night, the club was destroyed by Namoneshan after the explosion of a bomb loaded outside The Club.
Peter Hughes, the bagpack full of explosive material by suicide attackers was in the sidelights at the side bar, just 20 seconds before the explosion.
As a result of the explosion, they went to Koma, a month long and three times as they lived on life-guard devices.
Mr. Hughes says Patek was supposed to receive the same sentence, which was met by three other members of the army of the Prime Minister Jemmah Islami, who had been sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person must be sentenced to death before someone else.
To keep her alive, see, there's no reason to keep her alive.
After killing 202 people and countless people, 20 years of age is not enough to meet.
Tatak, the last person who's being decorated with the Bali bomb explosions is.
He survived for almost a decade, but eventually, in January 2011, he was arrested in Abtabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. army had killed the former alkayda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had provided evidence that the report had been in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to restore contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Alkayda.
Mr. Courtine says he didn't surrender.
Even to this day, so many people don't really have the pain of having mental pain.
The decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, marked by events in Bali and Australia.
Mr. Courtine said, this year will be a lot of tears.
Even yet, Prakech can appeal against his punishment.
F.A.: Air travel now can't use gadgets in the air (but can't call from cell phones)
From entering the air travel gate to get down to the gate, you will be able to use your electronic device to read, work, play games, watch TV, listen to music - but you can't talk to your cellphone - such Thursday is under the extreme-prepared new direction issued by the organizational flight administration.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
In a news conference, the FAA administrator Michael Huarta said how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
Airlines should show how the FAAA completes their aircraft, new directions, and how to update the rules to store the training manuals and devices of members of the driver crew to demonstrate directional directions.
The FAA has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Jetblue are from the airlines that have already presented plans.
The FAA said in a statement, depending on the status of the project, we can quickly acknowledge the widespread use of electronic devices.
Fly, passengers need to shut down their smartphones, teblets, and other devices when the plane door is closed.
They are expected to reach the height of 10,000 feet of the plane and continue until they are allowed by Captain.
The passengers are expected to relocate their device while the plane is landing, and don't turn on it until the plane gets completely down.
The FAA said, under new direction, airlines that are completely safe from electronic waste, they may allow their passengers to fly by plane, use the device when the plane is landing and taxiing time.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use yifai at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these standards.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Atendent, Laura Gladding has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, when policy will be successfully implemented - and we will work together with Airlines companies to do so - it would be a win for both sides.
When it comes to this point, we're tired, like Hall Moniters.
Agency said, but it will still be restricted to surfing, e-mail exchange, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting the Internet to less than 10,000 feet.
The passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, teblets, and other devices in airplane mode.
So there's still no conversation with friends, online-scrabble-like game, which is the famous event that is when Ectar Elek Baldwin was playing on his smartphones in 2011 while the plane park was on the station, and the U.S. Airlines had dropped them from the air when they stopped the device from closing.
And the heavy equipment, such as the laptops, must still be stored, because they will be concerned about hurting someone else in the cabin.
The cellphone calls will continue to be banned during the flight.
The nonprofit authority associated with phone calls is near the National Communication Program, not near the FAAA.
During the flight and landing of the plane, the FAA can remove the ban on some electronic devices.
Last month, Mark Rogenkan, a national transport security specialist in the National Transportation System of the National Transportation System, said that cell phones are still considered risky.
Rosenker said, 3cell phones are really serious issues, not only because they can possibly cause interference in navigation-related devices, but also because they can cause anxiety in cell phones towers when they are in the air.
In order to examine the issue, the industry World Perceptual Committee has held last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA is increasing in recent years to reduce restriction from using them.
Sann. Claire McCaskilk, D-mo, says there is no valid security reason for banning.
The use of the device is going to be even more difficult to promote these restrictions.
Some studies also indicate that nearly three passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn their device off.
The FAA began to ban the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996, when the passengers had received a report of neglect in navigation and communication devices due to the taking of FM radio and high-incomes of that time.
New Airlines companies are more dependent on the electrical system than on the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved to resist electronic interference by the FAAA.
Airlines have been proposed by passengers for years using Wi-Fi at cruising heights.
The airplanes modified for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interference.
Huarta said that most airline companies should meet qualified standards for more use of electronic devices under new direction.
Today's electronic device stimulates very little power radio transmission compared to the last generation's electronic device.
E-readers, for example, have a very nominal transmission during page rotation.
However, transmissions are effective when downloading or sending data via the device.
There's also Amazon.com of the party to reduce the ban on the use of the device.
In 2011, company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in Airlines and flew him to test problems but no such problem was found.
The FAA advise committee has expressed Mill-judicial feelings about the risk being used by the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aviation Transportation Association said that they believe that the waste that comes from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device being interrupted by the Aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, members of the committee agreed to allow the FA pilot to command passengers to shut down the device while air is being lowered in the low visibility.
The travel industry group has welcomed changes and has said that they have a common knowledge facility of people traveling during the latest period of technology.
The CDO. Roger Do of the U.S. Travel Association said that we are happy that the FAA has recognized that the trip with joy is not incompatible with rescue and security.
Learning from the celebratory bomb threats in the prison, UT police have taken a blanket for the Quick Revolution during the war of Maddenger Divali of security and during the emergency conditions.

For protection from the North C ridge, the bird was released back into the forest by air transport

Is Europe’s high class ready for business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and promised to bring business together and to determine what changes the UK's employment and prosperity maker would like to see in our relationship with the EU.
For him, we held the largest and most comprehensive survey of British professional leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gow for the consideration of 1,000 business leaders, who are representative of Britain's business size, areas and places.
The conclusion of this survey can be surprising to many.
We found that a large part of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing while the EU members are being dynamic.
They want the government to promote new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not in long-term and violent process of improving the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When they asked their thoughts about specific policies such as the product law from the law, most business leaders believed that the control of these determinators should come back to Westminster.
Common disparities could easily be seen with the single market, businesses say that the price of Brazil's dissolvation is far greater than the benefits of becoming part of Europe's commercial sector - even the vast businesses that were traditionally the part of European companies, 40 percent of which agreed on this.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of professional leaders found that, a large part clearly wanted that instead of politics with Britain, the EU, went on the way to trade-based relations and contract change.
The conclusion, which was seen in the standards of the major business groups, showed that businesses are moving towards a 30-dimensional change, which would restore its lost power to the UKK.
It has a high price - the issue of the contract change for Britain and the issue of getting a better deal changed 16 percent of opinion in favor of remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: it is the survey that Britain's businessman, E.U, supports their plan to discuss the terms of Britain's membership in Britain.
It also showed that businesses expect to re-assess the current power balance in favor of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is going to be extremely fast, as Eurozone is moving forward in the direction of the coordinated economy and capitalist organization.
The priority must be of jobs and growth in Britain, as the conclusion of our survey shows that it means a new focus on business and a fundamental change in the dissociation of Brussels.

The Royal Commission heard two of Wii-MCA employees accused of sex crimes before accusations against Jonathan Lord.
In 2011, before the Kiringbah child care staff was charged with Jonathan Lord's charge, two of the U.M.C.A. N.S.W. employees have been convicted of child sexual crimes.
But in his statement to the council, he said that he had not yet met the issue of child sexual harassment within his organization. It was told to the assembly.
The chief executive, Philip Hare, was asked about the case, where a U.M.C. employee was charged with child pornography crimes, and another case in which the U.S.C.C. Caringbah Jim Institute was charged with child sexual crimes against children in caring for him in 1991.
Mr. Hare said that he knew about the first case, but they didn't know about the other case.
He also admitted that the statement of the U.M.C.A. in front of the conference has been examined and that he has found the U.M.C.A. in the case of child safety, it is not correct.
It is a testimony to the organization that the YMCA was notified, and this year received the second highest rating in education and community quality audits.
Mr. Harey, who is associated with that U.M.C.A., admitted that due to appointing the Lord, the management has failed, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly informed of their duties related to child safety policy violations.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offenses with 12 children during two-year-old operations.
He was sentenced to Karavah for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that the YMCA had a cultural problem, which did not reveal child safety violations by Lord.
The workers who saw the violation gave the testimony to the Witnesses who had spent their time alone with the Lord, to make them engage in private sex, to sit them in God's house, to tell them that he loves them and let them play on their mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was in the study of the Lord, and he had said for child safety training, because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the Wii.M.C.A. Caringbah Baal Service Manager was very nervous and hard to meet for most of the time.
C.E.O. said that he did not accept the testimony of employees that they were not easy to inform from their manager.
He said, but his friend with the Lord led his decision to inform him about it.
Mr. Hare said he had given the Y.M.C.A.N.W. Mandal his view that the Jonathan Lord event was about not giving the text for the organization.
Mr. Hare said that shortly after the charges were made, the decision was to sign on confidentiality agreement by employees, by the Y.M.C.A., the child service was performed by Mr. Lim Wetley.
He said that its purpose was to avoid witnessing, but it was not properly executed.
Children's sexual exploitation at the University of Griffith, special Professor Stephen Smalbon said there was no safe organization during Jonathan Lord's work between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were major problems in the appointment, review, access, training, and experimentation of staff.

Blair says they want Britain's return.
Tony Blair said they would like to be Britain's prime minister again, but they believe that there is no chance of return.

When a crowd of experts showing horses for the greatest horse of the year in Cardiff, they knew that this would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet in school, and just a few months away from taking his first step, this young child and his Palut Sheltand's Tuttu Tafi made it easy to complete three steps and win the top -- he left 30 of his adult opponents behind.
In the annual competition held by the Suniback Equastrin Center in Cardiff's Cypdri, the unbroken pair - which is SK is long - was greatly praised for the appearance, behavior and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful baller hats, she pushed her flat hat on a elastic angle and took her two-year-old tofi with a ring.
The decisionmakers praised Fenton for his natural skills that have been too far ahead of his age.
And Tophie got the highest scores for his appearance and personality.
Fenti had been given as a gift on his third birthday in March, and has since then studied with this Totu in Shetland.
Her 30-year-old mother, Dona, said: “Fenton and Tofi are a wonderful couple.
They had to face the challenge with all hopes, but they both won the Gold Cup and Roset.
It was only the second chance, when he had participated in a competition with Tofi, and we all are very happy at his victory.
The most distinct in this landscape, he seemed so amazing to all of them that they wanted to take photos with him.
This small child of the Nantilo Village, near Eb Wells, South Wales, has been walking on the trails of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been displaying horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said: “The entire place was filled with enthusiasm, and everyone was enjoying and playing the train.
He was running on sand in the whole landscape, and he performed extraordinary tasks despite so small.
Fenton is a goddess of animals-- she loves horses, tractors and fields, and she has two chickens he cares for.
The way he started, he'll be in displaying a long time ago's greatest horse - and I'm confident he'll display very well.
The president of the annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton's age is only three years old, but he comes to control his tutu.
They're very good couples.
The decisionmakers listed the methods of Fenton and Tofi's demonstrations and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw the good team work between Totu and his rider - in this case, were the best in the Fenton and Tofi Ring.
I believe that Fenton's lovely clothes have helped him, he was actually looking very different.

But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had been guilty to write disturbing news about the partial proprietary company of the state.
Vincent said that the New Express is now fully improved.
The command was issued by Guangdong Press and publication, radio, film and television administration.

It directed the 12-yearchaining Aviation News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, an investigation of the responsible people for it in New Express and a quick revision of the leadership team of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote in New Express several articles condemning financial irregularities in a transaction-usage company called Zoomlon.
After the ban was lifted, their newspaper published two face-to-face appeal for their release and said he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came to the state television, accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
He told the state broadcaster CCCV that in this case, I've ruined Zoomlon and the entire news industry and its ability to win people's faith.
I did this mainly because I had a craving for money and fame.
I've lost my faults.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a headline apology, saying it failed to verify their report correctly.
Currently, many high-profile sensitive individuals have responded to TV- spread faults.
Experts say time-time has been strongly convicted, despite the fact that in this year a law prohibited authorities from condemning someone.

The U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel found its own railroad
One of the most complex drugs in Mexico between the U.S.A. and Mexico has been found to have its own lighting, wetlation and electric rail systems.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot three feet tunnels as one of the most complex hidden paths that have been explored so far.
The tunnel is about six football pitch's thick-sized length, which connects Tjiana, Mexico's close to Goddam and San Diego, U.S.A.

Scottland Yard said that he sent a 40-year-old Australian Assange a 15-year-old notice, for which he would have to attend the police station, and also said that he would be responsible for arresting himself when he failed to do this.
Assange is facing protests in Sweden following sexual crime charges, as well as their options under British law ended when the Supreme Court had rejected their appeal against the demonstration at the beginning of this month.
Stockholm will deliver them to the U.S., fearing that they had asked from the South American country for political asylum, asking for asylum in Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19.
One spokesman said that Scotland Yard has sent a 740-year-old Assaja a self-distance notice, which required them to attend the police station at the same time.
They're in violation of the terms of their collection.
The embassy refused to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that the United States will be issued from Sweden to deal with potential spy charges due to the release of more than 250 US US royalty cables on anti-Wikilix website.

Make foreign property on the masters, end London's artificial position
The finance department has officially calculated CGT measures, but is waiting for the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who offered stamp Duty at the 2012 budget of 2 million pounds, and those who prefer to keep a house in a company rather than a separate person, at the rate of 7 percent.
In the tax year 2012/13, the Stamp Duty, which is obtained from the residents of WestMinster and Kensington and Chelsea, has 708 million pounds, which are already more than the combined sum of the northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West A. Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook noted: \"After the rise and escoated anti-avoydance statement is presented in the stamp Duty of high-valued homes, it is very difficult to argue that there is a fairly low tax on high-valued proprie, which has no relation with the impact of the system by the old system.
He added that, however, this step could make some foreign investors silent in buying goods in London and make the current slaves unwilling to sell.

Scientists have shed light on the matter and the relationship between the dog's tail and his mood.
The previous findings have found that happy dogs move more to the right side (with the dog), while the sellers move their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that partners can recognize this tiny difference of dog tail and express their reactions to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Through the University of Trento, neuroscientist Professor Georgia Welllertigera stated: “Men all know that the left and right parts of the brain are composed of different forms of motivation that produce positive or negative emotions.
Here we have tried to see it in other republics too.
He said that the right part of the brain in dogs, like humans, was responsible for the left handwork and the opposite order, and that two spheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to one of the worst evils by other dogs, researchers looked at animals watching the movies of other dogs.
He analyzed the scars of the pet dog's heart and their behavior.
We probably don't take longer to understand why their doubles sometimes move to the other side.
Pro. Welllertigera said: \"We presented dogs with dogs' films - in shade to deal with other issues that are in the accurate version or confusion, and we could see the footing thing and present the tail more left or right.
And when the beast saw an evil dog moving toward the right side, it was full of rest.
But when they turned their tail toward the left side, their hearts swelled, and they became extinct.
According to Pro. Wellertigera, they don't think the dogs were deliberately communicating through these things.
Instead, they think the dogs have learned from their experience what they should be worried about and not on whom.
He said: - If you've met the other dogs several times, and if they constantly move their tail to one side, it's more friendly, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react to the same experience.
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better insight into the feelings of animals to employers, animal practitioners, and coaches.
John Bradshaw, a guest at the University of Bristol's School of Veternerary Sciences, explained that it is not the first study to examine whether left or right for dogs is important.
Last year, the University of Lincoln's team found that when the dogs see a paramac dog, they turn their heads on the left and their heads turn towards the right when they see the happy dog.
In other findings of the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: \"The opposite of the Italian study - when the robot's tail was moved to the left of the dog's expected right, it was more likely to reach his knight than to be sold by dogs.
He said this was the difference because dogs in various studies did not fully regard animals or robot dogs as suffocating.
He explained that it could help to study the way the dogs react to real dogs.
-Since different spines have shown much evidence that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more extensive information still remains - and no dog exceptions in this case.
However, the easier it can be to record their behavior, it seems that we probably don't have more time to understand why their differences sometimes move on the other side.

Pope Francis will first announce the cardinal's name in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis 22 will first make the Catholic Church a cardinal in his office.
The cardinals, the Catholic Church, have the highest class priests, their position is only below the pope, and these are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will assume the first group of his individuals, who will ultimately help choose their successor.
There's 201 cardinals right now.
Similarly, after reaching 80 years of age, cardinals are not allowed to participate in the pope’s election - they come to group 120-cardinal electors.
In a speech announcing the news, Vatican's spokesman, Fedriko Lombardy, said that before the new cardinals were introduced, all existing cardinals' meeting would be held, called Pope-Ga.
Lombardi said, Pop Francis has already decided to explain his decision to organize the Pope of February so that it might be easier to plan other meetings of cardinals from different parts of the world.
Jack Valero, of the Catholic Voice, said that by February, there was a chance to decrease the number of cardinal electors.
He said that the Pope usually announces the number of cardinal electors as low as 120, the cardinals, and the names of over 80-year-old cardinals as they wish.
Valero said that the next year's pope-all would be important, for this year, after Francis' election in March, it would be the first Pope-seat.
Currently there is a form of prejudice towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said. It would be interesting to see if the new pope, who also oversees cardinals from the rest of the world to establish balance.
There are forty percent Roman Catholics in South America, but the cardinals have very little number.
Francis's Council of Cardinals, which is a group of eight cardinals from around the world, will be the first cardinals selected after being formed.
Before this, the Pope had decided all things for himself.
Valero said, \"François has now chosen these eight cardinals to help him.
He'll ask for advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we haven't been in this situation before - it's totally new.
Valero said that the popes usually post cardinals to bishops of large places, but Francis. full of surprises, so we don't know whose name they will declare.

Some trucks may have a reduction in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the organization failed to follow auto security standards about seatbacks, head restaurants.

The screams of Obama’s Motives
I gave Obama twice as much vote as I expected change.
They say Obama's great efforts have been restricted because of the policy of the GOP resistance.
The policy of the barrier can not excuse the hardships of the Obamacare website, drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 convention reminds us of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Maurice Harvard Medical School has a second-year-old student.
I'm reading very sad books today.
It's a book about which I think it's going to stir me up during the second year of medical school poison and give me hope.
Its name is the courage to win, and it is a memorial of the 2008 presidential election campaign in Barak Obama's year.
When I get tired of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time in which politics inspired millions of people and talks could stop your breathing.
The elections proved uniform, and the news speakers had retired to demonstrate the historical significance of that time.
The eyes of my friends were full of joy, and my parents saved the news every man.
A group of youths were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, while Obama became president, he had 82 percent of approval ratings.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a severe truth, like the turning back from the world of dreams.
It is hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to remember a distance, a painful memory of lost opportunities.
The first time I left the vote was really changed.
It's easy to say I couldn't imagine anything of it.
I credit Obama with a lot of accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, and don't ask for it until Osama bin Laden is killed.
In addition, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has prevented many efforts to move to our country: including non-professional reform, public options for health services, blocking a hole on Guantamo Bay, and other than that.
But I'm not sure where I'm going to take a stand for the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, but I'm going to have the answer that I can give them.
I've reached the point of political disappointment.
The opposition policy of Republicans is not the answer of foreign leaders, nor the answer of drone attacks on innocent children in countries.
This can not answer data collections about the private lives of ordinary American citizens by the National Security Agency or the answer to the government's misbehaviour.
It can't describe the murder of the U.S. citizens of any train, univer L. Awalaki, nor the president during the camp, who is less than the public administration and traffic limits.
It can't answer the conclusions of the report, which says White House tries to silence the media, since the Nixon administration has been the most aggressive.
And most recently, it can't excuse the failure to design a simple website after three years of being signed into the Law of Afordable Care Act.
I don't know what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I had to assume that the government system could be able to justify the political campaign that led to it.
Obviously, the elected office is not a priori route, since anti-racist political parties and memorable events, such as the Newtown Murder, will shape our public discussion.
Still, the examples I have given above seem to have been mostly chosen by the administration.
This is most disturbing to you.
I re-voteed for Obama in 2012, but not because I was interested in her expectations.
Mitt Romani presented an illusion and an uncertain option, which did not seem to have to determine their policies or their position.
I thought another act for Obama, who will be free from pressure from future choices, will fulfill the hopes we've been hearing for a long time.
Nevertheless, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008.
Seeing him reminds me of their missing promises.
This week, a part of the book was reading, which described how Clinton was badly damaged by Obama in Pennsylvania Primery.
At a post-martum campen meeting, he told his subordinate employees that they needed to return to the stage, and to remain true to their purposes.
He said, I want to get my uncle back.
We should remember who we are.'
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I don't agree with you anymore.
The ideas expressed in this comment are Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that the interests of the P.M. Tony Abbott is struggling about the professional holiday plan.

Tony Aut's daughters Franzage and Bridget.
Should the outcome of the election come two months after we were voted?
We should have a better system.
Why can't we have a system in which we're going to fill our turn on the computer, vote immediately, and at 6:30 a.m. we have a result at 6:30 a.m.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark papers.
That's why, because if someone doesn't like him, can he remove it?
It's hard to use pencils in today's era.
The election is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint trial letter with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that their policies include building an international airport for the Sunshain Coast, and that they are very serious about their new work.
The public position is for public service.
He said that we should have no other award except that we can serve the community at this crucial time.
Which has to bother the promises.
While addressing the meeting held on this occasion, Bar Assision President Ramesh Singh Neggi expressed intense cry on the corrupt law system in the region.
They are fast growing up on officials and their families, showing that the criminals are being careless.
They have no fear of the police and the administrative system.
He mentions such incidents in different places recently, saying that the security of the common man can be easily guessed when the official community is not safe.

In fact, men of life have been given equal importance to religion, work, and moksha.
All desire riches and prosperity, and according to their persons, riches and prosperity.
He is the riches of wealth with which honor is attached.
If any man be rich, he shall not enjoy it, neither shall any man do any good to another.

He is the true riches, and he is the one who makes the way to the multitude of his wealth.
No one can have more money than the jobs created for others.
Another thing, wealth doesn't just as currency.
It would also be your health, character, love to others.

Trusted in the first president who was independently elected in Egypt
Muhammad Morsi has accepted his position, but their victory day may have ended the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamicist Mohammed Morsi, removed 16 months ago, promised the new Egypt when he sworn as the first independent president of the country to replace Hosni Mubarak.
On their official installation in front of the Supreme Constitutional Court, the first Islamic president, independent of the Morsi Arab world, and almost 60 years ago, has become the fifth president of Egypt.
They swore on their chairs by the river before the 18 judges who had been beaten by the court, who looked like the ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony displayed in live broadcasts on national television, Morsi said that we are looking for a better future, new Egypt and another republic.
The fanatical group Muslim Bradeud, who has been a 84-year-old nonkanuni declared organization since its establishment, and who has been targeting the previous governments, said that the 60-year-old engineer at the U.S., trained at the party's U.S., has laid the foundation for new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers took security of the building and, according to local times, came to Morsi in the small cafeteria of cars shortly after 11 o'clock in the morning.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to celebrate the new president's bombing, the traffic was also stopped for a while, so that their motor activity would go out of the normally busy street, which connects the city's center to its southern suburbs.
It was a great increase in Morsi's personal competition as a non-corruption tire of Bradshurd's non-corruption, and his speech on Friday presented them not only as a Islamicist but as a candidate for all those who wish to complete the 2011 revolution against the dictator Mubarak.
Morsi, wearing blue benzenes suit and red tie, swears to the judges sitting in a wooden panel's penal Chamber, saying that today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation.

On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tatarir Square, which is the origin of the revolution, which ended the dictatorship of Mubarak last year, and vowed to restore presidential powers that had been removed from their position last year.
But instead of accepting a customaryly competent oath of Parliament, they bowed before the military's will by agreeing to make an official oath before the court, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tatarier Square was filled with dramatic popular currency.

According to this report, the UPA government has spent $85 million over the past four years to celebrate the genius of the chief panel.
Rather, during the NDA rule (between 1999 and 2004,) a period in which no advertisements were issued by the government for the ongoing two years (2001-2002).
On Thursday, based on the 182-metacho of the 182 m high image of the chief panel in Kavadria in Gujarati, Moody said, \"There was no advertisement before this, on the occasion of the genius of chief Patel.
While DEVP's records say that the UPA spent $30 million in 2009, 2010-11 in $4.10 million in 2012, $27 million in 2011-12 and 1.4 million in 2012-13 on the advertising of the chief panel.
When the central information and broadcast minister was asked about Moody's claims from the Ministry of Affairs, he said that the BBP's PM Candadiet does not talk based on facts.
The UPA year was not brought up by any advertising on the panel in 2008.
About whom Tiwari said it was due to the financial crisis that year.
However, the funds spent on Patel's advertising are quite low every year on the genius and revenues of members of the clan-gad family.

Moving forward through mud, rivers, and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well, in the rural areas of Cameroon, is offering free health services
Wells and their crew watch hundreds of patients every week
There's no much more medicine in West African countries; there's only a physician for 5000 people.
Give your vote here or give it through the mobile
Dr. Georges Well year 2013 is one of the top 10 leaders of C.N. in 2013.
You can vote for them or for someone else at top 10.
The winner will get $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to his senses and faint, going to the hospital, which was not properly equipped to help them.
Jemel Well, in 1981, was caught in a car accident near the Atlantic capital of Cameroon.
In the beginning, their only hand was broken, but there was an infection that spread to their brain, and he made blood clots, which affected their remaining life.
Georges Well, there was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon.
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well continued to take his father to the extreme crowd of clinics and hospitals and to receive whatever treatment they could obtain.
Well said, it's not easy.
You leave home at 5:00 a.m. hoping you'll be the first person to get to the hospital, but that doesn't happen.
There are many sick people there.
Some people can wait and hold in the mouth of death.
The situation has not changed much since Wel's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one therapist for every 5000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, the United States has a doctor for every 413 individuals.
And even if there are physicians there, many Cameroonns can't afford it.
In the country, two out of five live below the poverty line, and about two thirds of the poverty in the country are in the private sector.
Well, they're the only problem in poverty.
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well took determination to settle it.
Last year, Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have been a free surgeon for 700 free medical purposes.
They also became physicians themselves, and worked as a doctor surgeon at the Centur Hospital of Grandior.
And he started the non-law organization Escouim, who goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his volunteers have helped some 32,000 people.
About every Friday, they sit in the van and about 30 people, bind the medical agents on the roof and go to rural areas where people need treatment.
Sometimes luck doesn't happen with them.
They have to push the vehicle more than once from rivers and dust to advance.
But when they arrive, they actually have a leader's honor: the best seats that can be offered by the feasts, singings, dances, and the community.
The free medical service in these villages is actually a reason for celebrating, and well - with their large smiles and endless energy - it includes happiness.
The next morning, their crew starts to meet hundreds of patients.
Well said, \"We're meeting 500 people every trip.\"
They come from village to village about 60 km away, and they come to foot.
All these weeks, clinics provide various medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get banking, don't get insurance, or a free birth certificate -- this document is required in school but most homeless families can't afford it.
The evening team performs simple surgery with the local termites.
Operations are usually performed at school's house, Town Hall, or home; after the process, the patient moves to a reversible place, and makes a place for the next person.
The group's generator publishes in the operating room and Sanitizing equipment, and serves as a morning-south on the whale and their volunteer Sunday.
It's commutable speed, but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
Well said, \"They keep us awake and play drums all night to keep us busy.\"
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including Cameroon's medical and foreign medical students - last year there have been 700 free blood transfusions, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One man said he would be able to go back to work because of free Hernia surgery.
The man said, \"This shall be the future for me and for my family.\"
In addition to performing weekly clinics and working as a surgeon-psychics in the hospital, the whale also works in a private medical clinic around the clock at night.
He said it's their second job that finances 60% of their non-profit work; the rest of the part is done by private donations.
Katy O'Malley said, \"I don't know when they sleep in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia.
They are always at the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization, so they keep running these campaigns.
It is a practical opportunity for students like O'Malley and nursing who come from United States and Europe to join in the Well campaign, which they can never get into their country.
O'Malley said, in the jin-style therapy, we help Dr. Well catch the tool or clean the blood dust, we are able to get practical experience.
In the United States, you will never have an opportunity to do so as a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students normally spend their time visiting Cameroon, and they often come with medical agents of donation.
But after hundreds of years have arrived, they live in Ana-jina and take up the cost of instructions.
O'Malley says, there's no doubt they're heros.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people will never end.
For Well, there's almost the same burden of work, not difficulty.
To help others to live happy, to keep the promise which your father made to you: these are the things that give them great joy.
Well says, I'm very happy to do this work.
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm gonna laugh people, to reduce their pain.

The Ministry of State has also recognized that they are also guilty of being a self-regulated pilot to Edward Snowden, as a rebel revelation to the NSA activities.
This secretion has brought the U.S. government to political ground in connection with its supportive countries.
Speaking through the video link at the free government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no question that President, me, and other people in the government were actually aware of some of the things that happened with the automatic pilots, as if they were looking back, the Second World War, and the Hard Years of Cold War, and then, certainly, it had its potential in 9/11.
They have become the first high-class members of the U.S. government, who have accepted that the U.S. spy has imposed its limits, but it has emphasized that no one's rights have been abused.
