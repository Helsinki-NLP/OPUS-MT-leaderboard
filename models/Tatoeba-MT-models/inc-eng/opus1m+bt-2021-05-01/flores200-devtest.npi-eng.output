In developed lands, you hear complaints about the quality of water, and the bridges falling down.
Why does the traffic system cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis, are traffic engineers only inappropriate, or are there some more basics running?
Traffic flow is the study of the engagement between two points of personal driver and ride device and the interaction they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the flow study is difficult when driver's behavior can't be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers seek to behave exactly the same way; thus, traffic streams have some practical stability and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main attributes: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with planning, design, and operation of road facilities.

Since students are often most important viewers, the blog author is trying to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging forces students to be more aware of the world around them. The need for a listener's attention motivates students to be persuasive and concerned (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages cooperation and encourages students to expand better education than traditional schools.
