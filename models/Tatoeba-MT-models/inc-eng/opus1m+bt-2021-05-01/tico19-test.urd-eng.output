How long have these signs been over?
And that's exactly what you're doing when you're older.
And with a fever.
And you need to check your cholesterol blood pressure.
And what you're still smoking?
And what's going to hurt you now?
And you're also having difficulty breathing.
And can you tell me what other symptoms you face with?
And you've got a lot of fever.
And whatever I have.
And a tongue, easy to see.
And today, I'm really getting a little more pain in crying.
Is it the Day of Judgment, or the Day of Judgment, of Judgment?
With it will be (given) a covering,
I think I'm a little bunny.
And I want to tell you where there's pain in the body.
And lo! they are weary.
And with your history of diabetes.
And you know, it feels like I'm gonna break my heart.
And you know that people always care about me.
And you're losing pain.
And you're saying you're under pressure to jump.
There is a heart attack at home with heart disease, high cholesterol high blood pressure
And other symptoms or problems that you feel with your stomach pain?
Are others at home sick with symptoms like you?
Do you have any other signs?
Are you having trouble breathing?
What do you still have pain in your throat?
Because it's the climate of the harvest.
But we can't ignore the pain that begins with the heart.
But now the more important problem is pain.
But I have trouble breathing.
But I know that many people criticize me.
But we need to be very careful about treating all the pain we experience
But now you're taking the breath correctly right?
I was completely forgotten because of this pain.
Does it look like someone's hitting your throat?
Are you still suffering from breathing?
Do they complain of being sick with these signs?
Do you have high high high blood pressure or any more chronic illness?
Do you have a chronic health disorder like Diabetes?
Did you feel the pain of breathing with pain in the chest?
Do you have a blood pressure?
Do you hurt breathing with this?
Do you know what this sign is?
Did you see the picture?
Drink plenty of water today.
But I've been looking for tests for the intelligence shooter.
But its signs are exactly like me.
How much is your fever?
How's your blood pressure?
If you're a chronic fever
If you have a hundred two or more fevers
If you think you don't see any improvement in your symptoms and problems.
I was confused yesterday.
I even had a little fever.
I was deaf yesterday.
I had a lot of pain to climb here.
I'm having some pain in breathing.
I'll send you a picture.
Today I'm feeling some pain.
Today I'm having some headache pain and some fever.
I think it's in charge.
I think it's a little complicated.
Is it like a man sitting on your knee?
Did it start with headache and fever at the same time?
It hurts in the middle of my chest.
It's a pain-like pressure in the skin.
It's in my ear.
It's in the middle of me.
It's in the middle of the air.
I'm getting hurt in my throat.
I'm so worried about this pain of crying.
I want you to tell me about the pain you feel.
As high as high blood pressure.
as if he were hidden pearls.
Now you can take a hostymol for the fever.
So, how long will these signs be for you, for many years?
Now you said you have pain in your throat.
Sometimes I feel some pain in my throat.
Well, you just have no symptoms with this pain.
Or is someone sitting on your knee?
The same is true with fever and the pain of headaches and stomach
Just in the middle of my neck.
Show me in this picture where you feel pain.
Because you have a fever.
So do you think some of these symptoms are about being pregnant?
So do your children have such signs?
Let me tell you about the pain of your throat.
The rising brightness of the night.
I've had a fever for two days.
The fever began to rise from last night.
It's Dr. Porter with the Treize Center in Imergency Rome.
So can you tell me a little bit more about your chest pain?
Well, in front of my body I feel pain in my chest here.
Well, I'm having severe pain in my chest.
Well, when I think this is painful.
What kind of pain do you have in your chest?
When did this pain start?
Where's the pain in touching you?
Where does this pain feel?
You feel stuck in your throat.
You know I'm Sebastian and others.
You said you're in pain.
European Union/ European economic region and the rapid expansion of coronary disease (COVID-19) from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
There are similar trends in the spread of cancers (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European economics region and in Britain, while the global epidemic of COVID-19 is increasing in different areas.
Based on Italy's experience, many countries, hospital and high-income hours should increase their preparation due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients with COVID-19 because they will need special care.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of Chinese cases were reported in the Chinese province of Hobby, Ohio, for unknown reasons.
On January 9, 2020, China's Center for America's Control and Preventing The Art of America said that the Wojtati agent is Neol Koronawairs, now known as Koronavairs-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, as a result of the lack of SARS-COV-2, the disease has been named as coronaryvirus disease (COVID-19).
So far, the evidence of history is that people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, along with pneumonia, without it, and most of them have health problems.
In ca 14% of cases, COVID-19 is more serious, which needs to be admitted to hospital, while those who face severe illness in 6 cases require extreme care.
The deaths of patients entering hospital due to COVID-19 are ca 4%.
In this study, we will analyze the attitudes of COVID-19 in every country and Britain in the European Union/Herry Economic Region (EU/EEA).
We compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA and Britain with Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and Britain.
After China, the COVID-19 spread more pagers, and the global global state of COVID-19 in the rest of the world is now the same country.
General, director of the World Health Organization (WHO) called COVID-19 a global epidemic on March 11, 2020.
In the March 5th, 1920, the supplementary et al reported the cases of first European confirmer COVID-19, according to WHO's case.
The first three confirmed cases in EU/EEA were reported on January 24, 2020 by three French men who returned from Hobby Wahwan, China's capital.
By March 15, 2020, all 30 countries of the EU/EEA and Britain (UK), under which COVID-19 cases have been reached, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported only in Italy during today's history.
Getting the total data and mass of COVID-19 cases
The prevention of disease and control of the European Center (ECDC) worldwide is the total number of COVID-19 cases in every country, only government sources, country's health, national health officials, and global health officials, and at 8:00 a.m. at 8:00 p.m.
These copies were used to examine the attitudes of COVID-19 in EU/EA and Britain and compare them to Italian.
As the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we've calculated the expansion of 14 days of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the natural course of COVID-19 in Britain during the period of March 15, 2020.
We compared Italy to the time of January 31 to March 15, 2020, and set up a series of data from each country to 8:00 p.m.
Attitudes of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and Britain.
Generally, the 14-day final expansion of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and Britain is according to the Saudi Hobby (Gen 1).
For EU/EEA and Britain, the expansion of COVID-19 began on February 21, and then began on February 28, 2020.
This is due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported by most Italians, but the spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and Britain has been similarly demonstrated.
In Figure 2, the total number of cases of COVID-19 is shown in comparison with Italy during the time of January 15, 2018, in the United States and Britain.
It was highlighted that, as March 15 was 8:00 a.m., only 3 weeks ago, compared to that of Italy, the total number of cases of EU/EEA and other 15 countries in Britain were first reported.
Our results point to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported by COVID-19 in EU/EA and Britain.
COVID-19 reflects the trends observed in the collective spread of the COVID-19 that the global epidemic is at the rate of comparison in all countries.
Still, countries are at different levels, changes in national health response to changes in public health and in countries as possible, and a different protocol for choosing cases and patients with a case test should be tested for the validity of COVID-19 with a case test.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors from the area affected by Italy spoke about the situation in which COVID-19 patients needed extreme care and the resource reported that the hospital and the overcrowding units had already reached more than their own capacity.
At the current level of EU/EEA, there are statistics regarding any hospital and/or superintegration units of COVID-19 entries (not shown).
However, to complete the number of cases and deaths reported, they must be collected in an organized way.
A 2010-11 study has shown that in Europe 292.2 and in Portugal, every 100,000 population has been raised to 4.2 beds from top to bottom and middle-aged housing.
This means that these countries will have less and less resources such as the United States (approximately 12.5 for every 100,000 population in 11-2010) and have a total of between.
The model careers associated with increased health care capacity, the amount of COVID-19 cases entered every EU/EA country and hospital in Britain, which are associated with an increase in levels of high-intensity disorder, have been provided at least 90% of the severity of the EVID-19 combined in the release of ECDC.
Since so far there are cases in countries in the EU/EEA and in certain parts of Britain, and usually the hospital and the superintendent countries explain the population of the region, the number of cases and the number of high-income housings is greater than 2 (UNTS-2).
The situation in Italy and the current attitudes of other countries show that the global epidemic of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading in EU/EEEA and Britain.
In countries, hospitals and high-intensive care hours should prepare themselves for permanent community migration of SARS-CoV-2, and increase of COVID-19 patients, as in Italy's affected areas, need to be treated as a particularly high percentage of health care.
As recent ECDC rapid analysis, I have been told a fast, active, and comprehensive point of view to delay in spreading SARS-COV-2, which can be done with a change in a reduced perspective, if the action is not implemented before time, then the number of cases will not provide the immediate increase in decision makers and schools to recognize their response, recognize and adjust accordingly.
The rapid analysis also lists health measures to reduce the effects of global epidemics.
There is a small opportunity for countries to increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the stress of health care.
With failure in this case, it is likely that those who manage health care in EU/EEA countries will face a high risk of developing patients during the weeks.
Due to the widespread spread of coronary heart disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 3,000 deaths and over 80,000 people in China and the world have been affected, resulting in the destruction of humans.
Like the Homologous virus SARS-Cov, which causes SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 can be spread by mosquitoes and are caused by similar microorganisms.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and rate deaths than SARS, but it affects older people and women more than men.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications about the emerging disease, the ARC attempts to provide timely and comprehensive review of the progressive research article.
We're going to cover the basics about antiviral, viral, biopsy, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of diseases.
Although there are still a lot of questions that need answers, we hope this examination will help us understand this dangerous disease and end up.
On January 25, 2020, the Christmas season became an unforgettable and unforgettable reminder of the need to live in homes and for all Chinese peoples to avoid widespread Null Waterl disease and to live in several weeks.
This is a highly homologous with the virus Coronavirus (COV), which has spread in 2003, so it has been called SARS (SARS) on February 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization (WOHO), and the disease associated with COV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The plague began in Vienna, China, and rapidly spread throughout the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus had led to the health of 40,000 patients and over 80,000 deaths with COVID-19 confirmed cases.
WHO warned that the number of COVID-19 is 1 enemy, and that is stronger than terrorism.
According to Pub Mead (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19 in less than two months, which includes the Virrolols, diseases, medicines, treatment and treatment of various patients after the first report of 7 January 2020, and has produced more than 200 cases.
This review seeks to summarize the creative performance in the new and rapidly developed topic.
Whenever possible, we'll try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV, a cancer syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) born in 2012.
We'll talk about what has been learned about the diagnosis and prevention of the disease and still some of the other important questions.
For humans traditionally, CoV has been considered non-motivated pawns, mainly due to approximately %15 of the common nines.
In this century, however, we have two highly multi-metaled CoVs, SARS CoV, and MERS -COV, who produced this disease in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread this terrible disease to many other countries with their deaths.
So the current COVID-19 people's record history is the third of the CoVC.
As shown in the form, form 1.1, I was the first report in the Chinese National Health Commission on December 31, 2019, about the violence of pneumonia.
Seven days later, CV was organized.
On January 15, 2020, there was the first John Levi Koss in Vienna.
The plague spread across cities, provinces, and countries.
January 20, it was reported infection among health care professionals, which means that it could be transferred from man to man.
On January 23, Wahwan was locked down by blocking all public transportation in the city.
January 24 was first told in the medical study, that only 21 of 41 patients in confirmed cases were reported to have a seafood market, which is considered to be the location of the beginning of this infection by some unidentified animals.
On January 30, WHO called the global health crisis.
By the time that the report arrived, the disease had already spread to countries around China and around the world (shell.2).
Since the situation is rapidly approaching, there must be a final assessment of the epidemic.
February 11, 2020, on patients with 8,866, was reported in a freshest explanation of this virus in the 4021 confirmed patient of the Bishmol COVID-19, a provincial study (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Ulbi-HX_rHPXA2bdA).
SARS-COV-2 people of all ages, but especially those who are 65-30 years old.
Nearly half of the victims (%47.7) are over 50 years old, less than 20 years old and only 14 are affected or less than 10 years old.
SARS -COV-2 has affected more than women (0.27/1000).
The COVID-19 Hobby was mainly in areas around it.
The analysis of COVID-19 was on average 5 (9-2) days since the beginning.
The average duration of the sample was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13).
The main toll number (R0) was 3.7 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjective was R0 2.23-4.82.
According to the time of a massive raid in China, the number of victims increased rapidly before June 23, 2020.
The rate of patients with confirmed cases of cancer is %1.44 (%95 cl:1.10-1.86%) and the adjunct rate of all patients was %3.06 (%95 cl: 2.002-4.59%).
The three major dangerous factors of COVID-19 were gender, age (60), and severe samples.
CoVs is a large and mixed virus, which is a part of the DNA function, the right family.
They are divided into four generations, beta, gamma and deltas, from which they are sent to affect the fea and B Ta-COVs.
The accompanying episode binds to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the outbreak is fiftieth.
Virusal genetics continue to develop into the cyto plasma, and after the imitation of viral genes, genetics with RNA, mixed glyco hythmologists and anti clumins, which then fuse with the plasma membrane, to release the virus.
The first genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
More than %99.98 SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new type of Beta's geneticity from the root location of the Wahan seafood market in Vienna.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 gets more than SARS-CoV.
Because of the transfer of the electric microscoa, SARS -COV-2 particles have been found on the most frequent part of the appelium of human breath.
Human ACE2 has been found not only for SARS -COV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, Slamia of SARS-COV-2 is more fragile than SARS-CoV, which is agreeing to be the fact that SARS-CoV, is a less inflection than SARS-COV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also create secret lesmia through the code orf3b.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play its role in the Orf3b portal system and express itself in IFNB, but there is no known active domain form of the orf8.
On February 18, 2020, the Zanou At Alley, reported a complex resolution in the structure of EM with E0AT1 in the full length of human ACE2 and 2.9  nothing.
He found that complexities, including open and closed changes, were collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 problem is two Slammaries, which can suppress the CV's identity and the evidence of infection.
B0AT1 can be a cure for screening drugs to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and Modern Representatives
It's well-known that SARS-CoV and MERS-COV, started with both magnets, moved to humans through hot balls and camels.
By comparing SARS-COV-2 with other CoVs, the magnet is considered the local representative of SARS-CoV-2, because the new virus is %96 chamgars like the two SARS-like CoVs Bat-SL-COVZX45 and Bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, we can't go, which middle representative has helped to block obstacles to impress humans, and can't explain the way to move again.
G, et, al, had suggested snakes from the chimpanzees to humans as a carrier of virus, including homologous recombination within the Esproton.
In Guanging, China, the Mayan has suggested that the long-term gold ningolon used in traditional Chinese medicine, the rats, the rats, the peglin and SARS-CoV-2, can represent the possible midlife of SARS-COV-2.
However, the %1 difference between the two genomes is still a big difference, similarly, waiting for the final results of the popular show.
Most of the sources of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-COVs can live in a dry environment for 48 hours and 20 °F, less than half a cent grade and 40%-50% in the cash for 5 days.
SARS-COV-2 has similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is from the top-down, and from the temperature of 56° Centigrad for 30 minutes, or from %75 Athol, Clever's D-Infectant, Political Acid, Chlorum, and other anti-terrorism, but the virus cannot be inactive effectively.
The SARS-COV-2 is generally low-power defenses in the entire human population, and that is why they are suffering from novell viruses.
In recent years, no detailed study has been reported on the security reaction of SARS-CoV-2.
In this way, we can specifically refer to future studies about SARS- CoV and MERS-CoV.
Usually when a virus attacks a representative, the representative's immune system identifies the first kind of reactors, including C types of electronic receptors, radioactive receptors (TLR), nLR, and RIG-I-Var receptors (RLR).
Through a variety of ways, Virus Sozzh's population, the integrity of the ventriculates, and the role of the I-type interferron (IFNs), which limits the spread of viruses and encourages his viral resistance genes to speed up, speeding up the microfuge phagoscitos.
However, the SARS-CoV can help prevent Nlemia virus from reacting.
Soon, the immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes play a key role in defense of cells +CD4 and +CD8.
The T cells of +CD4 encourage B cells to produce specific antibiotics related to viruses and kill directly infected cells with +CD8.
T helper to create the Prosperation Setae them to help with the defense cells.
However, the CoV can prevent the effects of T cells by promoting apoptosis.
Human force defenses require the completion of Bishmol C3a and C5a and the NB body to combat the viral infection.
For example, MRS-CoV is affected by the immune system, separated from the health health patient.
On the other hand, due to an increase in the immune system, there are a number of free radicals locally that can damage the puppys and other body members, and, bad conditions stop working and even die.
The SARS-COV-2 infection is highlighted at the beginning of the class, and it is more likely to affect elderly and pregnant women.
It is common among those who are two or four of the large numbers of viruses, who are immune to the effects of these people, are more likely to be affected than others.
The average 14-1 days, mostly 7-3 days, during the sample of SARS-COV-2 based on the study of 425 cases in Vienna.
However, according to a study on the 1099 cases, the average length of the sample is 3 days and from 0 to 24 days.
As stated above, a recent study shows that there were 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days of sample based on 8,866 cases.
For health officials, it is important that they arrange an effective study period based on the exact length of the sample so that people who are affected but have not shown signs can be saved from the transfer of virus.
Generally, people who are affected by it need to be connected for 14 days.
Should the Quanta period increase for 24 days?
Often COVID-19 has an important and early sign of fever, with no other indication that the other symptoms, such as dryness, pain in breathing, pain in the stomach, seizures, headaches, headaches, headaches in the throat, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, and vomiting.
Some patients have to stop breathing a week after the beginning of the disease.
In serious cases, it is rapidly better to be involved in patients with synaptic syndrome, hypertension, metabolization, and commencing.
The fever and/or breath symptoms and severe fevers, even with minor pharmacological amputation, should be tested for the initial analysis of patients.
A population study at the end of December 2019 revealed that in the end of December, %98 fever, %76 dryness, %55 breathing, and %8 of the patients with symptoms of the syndrome.
In two recent studies, the family shirts and non-significants have produced similar results about a shirt caused by a shirt.
Compared with this, a 2012 study suggests that there were also major symptoms of malaria - COV patients with fevers (%98), dryness (%47), and respiratory cancer (%55).
However, some of the %80s needed assistance, more than those of COVID-19 patients, and MERS compared to COVID-19.
There were also cases of MS patients with breast (%26) and throat pain(21).
It has been proven that there are (1)00-99 percent of SARS patients with fevers (75-29 percent), breath stops (42-40 percent), districts (25-20 percent) and street deaths (25-13 percent), and about 20-14 percent of patients needed assistance.
Until February 14, when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576, the COVID-19 rate was %2.
As of November 2002, SARS confirmed cancer rate at 8,096 rate was %10.
On the basis of a population study in June 2012, the rate of death in MRS was %37 in confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the number of SARS-COV-2 R0 was greater than 6.47 with the trust delay (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV's R0 was only between 2 and 4.
This conflict is compared to the SARS-COV-2's SARS-COV and MERS-CoV, the rate of deaths and the number of tolls.
The following figures tell us that SARS-COV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less than two later viruses.
So, controlling the threat of SARS-COV-2 is more difficult than the attacks of MERS-COV and SARS-CoV.
Often shirts start with a single family or a single gathering ride, such as a ship.
Often during the two weeks before the beginning of the patient, there is a history of communication with the elderly in the Vahanan or other affected areas.
However, it has been reported that people can place the virus within them for two weeks without showing signs, and those who are infected with the hospital and who are getting sick may again experience the virus, which plays a bell to increase the concentration time.
The early levels of these diseases (e.g. lymphocytes) were found to be less common.
For example, the number of white cells in the blood is < 4×109/L, which includes the number of lymphocytes < 1×109/L, and COVID -19's 1,099 patients with hypertension and malaria.
In some patients ’ liver and stomachs, meoglobins were increased in the blood, and most patients were infected with the blood of C-unactive el hemorrhemia and Atrosite clotting.
In cases with severe cases, the D-Dymer, the reduction in the blood, was increased, so the number of lymph sites gradually decreased.
COVID-19 shows a double-sized shadow or ground glass on the ground.
In many cases, the common pattern of patients, the severe pain of pedophiles, the severe cold of breathing, is the ARDS.
There is a great deal of understanding in the harvest of the Fibrous Gases.
With Type I and Type II being inactive, the circuit reduces the level of efficiency and increases the level of temperature, thus reducing the risk of spread and failure of peptides.
So, the consequences of the worst radiographer in the skin are extreme proportions of illness.
On February 18, 2020, like SARS and MERS patients, and the thirst of ARDS and viral infections showed the formation of homocytes, hylienism, and antipsychotics in the early medical analysis of COVID-19.
For the analysis of COVID-19, the quality of use of reversing the Revers Transceptive Police Chinese Response (RT-PCR) was the key factor in the use of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
On February 13, 2020, because of the greater rate of negative lies in China, which can accelerate the flow, the use of medical data for analysis (which is no longer completely related to RT-PR).
The situation was similar to the SARS investigation.
So, for an effective analysis, in the history of illness, medical tests, lab tests, and radiologic outcomes all have to be done.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a prototype of the use of a Srilack technique based on the SRISPR, which will be used at a low rate of 20x10-18 microliters/liters from 20x10-18 microliters/liters without the need for fuels of SARS-CoV-2.
It is likely that if the medical models are confirmed, new technological sensitivity and ease of communication will increase dramatically.
Because of the lack of experience with Novel CoV, mainly patients with COVID-19 may provide assistance, while there are similar efforts to do various treatments that were previously used to treat other CVs such as SARS-COV and MERS -COV and other viral diseases (Jedol2).
These methods of treatment include recent and possible antiviral drugs, ammonosparests, steroids, health care professionals, Chinese medicines and psychological aid.
Even health professionals suggested that the treatment be used.
Drug companies are running against viruses to produce antibiotics and vaccines.
In the beginning, SARS-COV-2 is primarily on the puppys, and that's a small amount of ACE2 that attacks the other organs like clean and surrounding.
In any case, the greatest risk and deaths are the cause of respiratory damage and the failure of puppys.
So, to help the end of the signs and save lives, the general oxygen, the faster oxygen oxygen, the weak-intervention solution, and the mechanical interventions.
In the breathing system, patients with severe pain are being helped by the outbreak of the Dental Carporial Oxygen (ECMO), using a modified Cardio Pulmonary Technique to treat the failure of breathing in life.
Furthermore, for the care of the lectro lights, the safety of important organs in SARS-CoV-2 patients, there is a need to prevent antidepressants and antidepressants.
It has been said that as a result of the increase in immune systems between SARS and MERS, the cytoine system comes to the stream.
Setto them is a kind of system of sozzy reaction that comes from a series of Sietos, a series of 'Siteto' of them, Bishmol TNFα, IL-1α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-6, IFNα, IFNα, IFNα, and MCP-1.
A large number of independent radicals, which are a major cause of severe pain in the system of the soul and the failure of the various organs, are involved in the development of their immune cells.
Sieto from them strum, especially for treating severe ill patients, is essential.
Sieto has been used for treating them with stroms, Coryoko Sténds and Toiszimb an EL6 Molocolonal Antibody.
Siteto was suspended in treating them other defenses of the strome; IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF were suspended; JAK was blocked; suppressing the heart attack 4; and the prevention of HADC, the prevention of aggressive response to the Til configuration.
In SARS, a large-scale study was used as an ammono supervist as a treatment for reducing the damage to SARS.
However, those patients with SARS and COVID-19 did not benefit from the heavy feeding of the strides.
Instead, it can lead to severe judicial effects, especially in the dramatization of the spherical osteonecrosis.
Still, COVID-19 patients with acute illness have been advised to be careful about the use of short - food courses in the Correcostride.
The Taim script has not yet been confirmed by any effective antiviral treatment.
However, with the rhymiosis of TK in an American patient afflicted with COVID-19, the WHO-Type Anna Log was found to be effective.
Remitesus is a new anti-viral drug, originally prepared to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg's viruses.
Later, Remitesus was later considered to be a means to prevent RNA viruses, as well as MS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilde provided a corresponding China for a couple of trials on SARS-COV-2 victims, with a lot more than expected.
Also, for patients who suffer from severe breathing pain, antiphrona, lunavi/retonauo, and Serrern has been recommended for possible treatment.
If treated with lunavi/retonau, it can show the damage and other negative reactions.
Other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Healthy patients and HIV - positive descendants
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have been infected with this disease to protect the health of other patients.
In fact, there is a relatively high amount of antidepressants in the blood of patients who are often healthy.
The NB body is an amyloglobulian (Ig) that helps to combat stomach genes and other foreign things and identify the unique resources on the digestive system and affect them directly.
On the basis of this, COVID-19 was collected from the blood of patients who were infected with HIV and were admitted to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms, such as respiratory and viral loads and lack of oxygen in the blood, improve in 24 hours.
But a particular approach is not yet ready, so it must be confirmed and explained before deciding on a large scale.
Also, in view of the effects of treatment, some of the damages associated with plasma should be considered.
For example, the NC body increases the immune response, and the cyto can cause their reward's syndrome, which is possibly life-threatening angle.
Usually the number of antibodies in the blood is low, and there is a higher demand for plasma for treating severe patients.
It is so difficult to prepare the specific edibody to fight against the global epidemic.
In order to distinguish B cells from healthy patients and encode effective antidepressants, genetic code identifies Wires, which is a delicate and difficult process.
This way we can speed up the preparation of the antibodies.
In China, traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat different diseases for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend on a large scale on a number of factors in a form that depend on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine.
Many of the most influential elements are unknown because such elements are hard to remove and confirm their best collection.
More recently, because of the impact and lack of specific treatment of COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment.
For example, the COVID-19 treatment has proved to be the ZooFin Ji Lou Caposol and Ling China Young Kaposol.
In the majority of China's cases, patients with COVID-19, including Gnasso (63.7 percent), Ninzia (50 percent), and Janan (50 percent), see the high rate of treatment in their patients using traditional Chinese medicine, while Hobbie Siva, who used only 30 percent of her COVID-19 patients with traditional Chinese therapy, had the highest rate of health care (13 percent).
However, this is a very hard comparison, such as the effects of this analysis should include the number and severity of patients like many other publics.
On February 18, 1920, speakers and colleagues published a study on comparing Western medicine with traditional medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (WM).
They found that in a group of Western medicines + traditional Chinese medicines, rather than just a group of Western medicines, was relatively rare.
Incredibly affected, the symbolicly growing sign (from the wave) was particularly low in the WM group compared to the WM+TCM group ( 46.2% compared to 7.4%) and the rate of deaths (39% compared to 8.8%) was exceptionally low.
In any case, traditional Chinese medicine is still on a large scale and is still waiting for a better and more controlled trial of its performance and safety in more cases.
It would be interesting, if possible, to highlight the method of treating traditional Chinese medicine.
In the context of COVID-19, patients who have been confirmed are most highly diagnosed and even have to face the fear of the country, the fear of the disease, and the fear of the unknown.
Further, the symptoms of infection, such as fevers, shocks, and sensibilities can lead to negative effects of treatment, such as sleeplessness, overdrinking, and mental stress.
In the early stages of SARS, there are reports of mental disorder, anxiety, depression, depression, psychosis, psychosis, depression and suicide.
As part of the health crisis of COVID-19, it can make people more concerned about the impacts of terrorism and abuse on their families and friends.
Similarly, patients with COVID-19, joint members, with those in contact with them, should provide mental health care for those in need.
There must be clear communication with professional electronic tools and applications to prevent the use of antipsychotics and appropriate freshness of mental health teams, the use of SARS-CoV-2, and its treatment plans, and the use of private electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
In order to prevent the movement from moving from animals' flocks, and the victims, it is important to have an effect, and to control the flow of the virus often requires digital treatment.
Long periods against SARS and efforts have been made to create vaccines based on Slamia to create the protein-based immune system and the protein nuclear weapons system and/or protective power defenses.
The vaccine that directly affects animals’ examples for SARs was analyzed.
However, before medical studies are started, older people can’t provide the benefit of these vaccines to protect against the development of chemical channels and animal viruses.
That's because SARS had passed away 17 years ago, and there's no new case report.
On the other hand, in the Middle East and in other areas where animal viruses are permanent sources, the MRS commission is going on.
In order to disable viruses, some of them have been tested on animal models using anti-violin products such as DNA, viral vectors, nanocoats, viruses, and pesticides.
For non-commercial individuals, the quick and important task is to control the preparation of the immune system against SARS-COV-2.
However, it is a challenge to control the difficulty due to the need for long periods of time (usually 18 months) for oxygen preparation and the ongoing changes of CoVs.
COVID-19 has started to show their medical care in thousands of patients as a newborn disease.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without any treatment.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with more disease and death in severe cases.
Therefore, health care agencies need to create health care models in order to prefer their services in areas where low resources are scarce.
On the basis of the medical studies that have been reported so far, the analysis of the following public COVID-19 patients may be linked to their being affected (Jedol33).
Age: The SARS analysis was the most important factor in age, which is now correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 is primarily about 65-30 years old. In the study above, 47.7% of those who were diagnosed were over 50 years old.
There is a high risk of high risk of high blood pressure, and there are more than those who do not have such complexities (not 51 years of age), who offer COVID-19 patients as an assessment of age.
Sex: As stated above, SARS-COV-2 affects men more than 0.27/100,000.
We're afraid and complicated: COVID-19 patients who need extreme care are at risk of heart and breathing.
SARS patients also have the most fundamental cause of death.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 can also be linked to the positive colonocate of ACE2, which could lead to a problem with liver damage in patients with COVID-19.
It is noteworthy that age and primary illness have a strong relationship and that they can interact with each other.
Libertarian results: the level of C reactivation in the blood represents the severity of the injury of tissue and has been suggested as a possible analysis for the treatment and eventual recovery of the disease.
C- Reactivation of the COVID-19s has been recommended.
Furthermore, Newly-Wouted Lectet or Heidro Genes (LDH), Superat Attoranspherus (AST), Aa Naine Aw Conference (ALT), and Cratine Cons can also help to predict the results.
These embalmings are expressed in numerous organs, especially hearts and livers, and they emerge through the damages that reach tissue.
So, they are traditional symbols of heart disease.
Important medical symptoms: the results of COVID-19 and the long term improvement of medical symptoms should be considered to be associated with other tissues.
The use of Strides: As stated above, antidepressants commonly use strides to reduce the spread of respiratory damage as an aid to the disease.
Since caricoid levels were used on a large scale in severe SARS patients, many survivors had to cope with aging and poor quality of life.
So, if necessary, patients with COVID-19 should be used for short periods of time.
Mental stress: as stated above, many patients during the outbreak of COVID-19 had to face extraordinary stress due to long-term suffering and seeing the uncooperative death of close family members and fellow patients.
In order for these patients to recover from stress and return to normal life, psychological skills and long term help must be provided.
According to the population studies so far, it seems that the negative characteristics of COVID-19 are different from SARS.
The SARS-COV-2 can also be attached to the bottom of the breath or nose, and the first phase of the infection is caused by lighting or not having any sign.
So, in the early stages, patients who are affected during the time of the sample can produce a large amount of viruses during daily activities, making it difficult to control the virus.
But SARS-CoVI compassion is the time when the patient is seriously ill, while the early stages are not too tolerant.
The current of COVID-19 is thus more severe than the SARS plague and it is hard to control.
At present, there are hopes and efforts to create the transfer of SARS -COV-2 to lock down the cities and the cities around China and the entire population by continuing to keep the lock down.
Although these measures are dramaticly harming the country's economy and other sectors, this has resulted in a reduction in the number of new patients, which is a sign of the slowness of Obama.
The most happy thing is that this plague will end in March and its dun sung will be between 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts have no hope like that.
Paul Hunter, et al., has figured that COVID-19, which causes more severe disease than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Iran Loungi et al., establishing a model for global warming forecasting the results of global warming, suggested that SARS-COV-2 can affect two thirds of the global population.
A group in Canada reported that two weeks ago, the head turbine and glyns of patients who were infected with the hospital were affected by SARS-CoV-2, which shows that the new identified virus could be encepholinza's rotation.
However, on the basis of the reduction in the number of new cases, there is hope in China, which indicates that present wisdom is working.
Actually, in Ebola, half a million cases were predicted.
However, through severe concentrations and isolation, the illness has finally been controlled.
It is also possible that as SARS-CoVC, SARS-COV-2 is weak and eventually ends up with humans like less ill viruses.
The following is a comparison of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-COV-2 sensors or skating and possibly transfer directly from the virus through contact.
It's also found in the virus, which makes it a new possibility of moving to the mouth from the lungs.
A 138 recent study on cases reported that 41 percent of cases were likely caused by abnormal infections, 17 patients who had already been diagnosed with some other disease, and 40 health care professionals.
So, people, especially those who provide health care, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even patients should be very careful.
The first defense strategy is a mask on the face to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both circuit masks and N95 breathing masks (Syres # 1860s) helps to control the spread of viruses.
The masks from a potential or affected group are blocked by a bus or a bus, where they can reach others.
However, only N95 (Cyral #1860) Moscow can avoid joining the breath of a small virus from 10 to nm 80, with 5 percent of virus currents completely entered, SARS-COV-2 sizes, both about 85 nms.
Even when five ridges or masks are joined together, they can also contain the following, so those who are directly involved in health care should be able to monitor N95 (Cyral #18060s).
In addition to masks, health care professionals should wear a cow that is separate in order to reduce communication with viruses.
Viruses can also affect a person through eyes.
On January 22, 1920, a doctor was affected by SARS-COV-2, although he had a N95 mask; suddenly the virus entered his eyes.
So, those who care for health care should look at their faces as they work with patients.
It's extremely recommended for people of affected areas that they often wash their hands more often than usual, try to connect themselves inside the home and possibly limit contact with the affected ones.
Three feet from the patient are thought to be a suitable distance.
These are the most effective ways to reduce the risk of an emergency infection and prevent the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new virus in the human world, this 7th January 2020 report is a high-coV association of SARS-COV, and should be a reason for the high-ranking high-representation of SARS in 2003.
But on January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Vohwan comforted citizens by saying that the nool virus has a relatively low and limited capacity in humans and that it is not a problem to prevent this disease and to control it.
This message brought the public's alarm, especially when they were preparing for the Winter Festival, and lost at least once to control this disease in Vienna.
In China, engineers who can control diseases said that this problem was a major improvement in the future.
For example, these agencies must be on guard during public announcements (1) as every word can be important to citizens and change their attitudes and judgments; (2) instead of insisting on the official reports of doctors or officials, there is a sense of humor and can react; (3) instead of providing relief to the public, by controlling its early stages; and (4) the public's warnings about health issues are often more important and can often be more effective in testing and improving the system of society.
The charge of COVID-19 began in December 2019 by the Novell virus SARS-COV-2.
Taim script, it's spread in less than two months, all over China and around the world in other countries.
Since the virus resembles the SARS-CoV and has the same symptoms as COVID-19 and SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of reproducing SARS.
However, there are some relevant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for keeping the disease and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects men and women over the age and more than youths.
The SARS rate is higher than COVID-19 (up to 10.91).
COVID-19 patients can also transfer viruses when there are no symptoms, while SARS patients do so when they are severe ill, which makes it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is relatively faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients can have regular RNA negative for SARS-COV-2.
In other cases, viruses can be positive once more in healthy patients.
This results in dramaticly increasing the fear of the spread of viruses.
In view of the rapid progress in the COVID-19 research, there is still a solution to several important problems, as is the following:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although the SARS-COV-2 and the two-bit SARS-specific CoV have been found with 96 percent of the genetic union, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 has come from sheep.
The original representative, from the magnet, who was the middle of the transfer of viruses to man?
Without answering #1 and 2, we can't effectively reduce the migration process and it can spread again at any time.
Although the annual modelling and biotechnology test shows that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with this ACE2, how does this virus get into the cells of the breath and how does it lead to digital changes?
Does the virus also link to the cells that reveal ACE2 in the other cells?
Without the correct answers to these questions, we can't get faster and more effective treatment.
How long will this plague continue?
How does the virus get genetically ready during moving into humans?
Will it become global epidemics around the world, like SARS or will it end up as time goes by?
It's important, but it can take some time to find answers to the above and some other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop this flow quickly and return our life to normal.
The Amazing Source of Human Corona Viruses
For thousands of years, change and harmony, including humans, have led to the Corona virus and their host species' evolution.
Prior to 2003, two human cancer viruses (HCOVs) were known for a common cold.
The SARS (SARS) and the system of breath in the Middle East could show how devastating and dangerous HCOV infection can be for life.
At the end of 2019, the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 in Central China once again highlighted CoVs and her sister moved faster than SARS-CoV and reduced us to the Petion Assembly.
The HCOV infection is a transfer to humans from animals and it serves us to understand the source of the HCOV.
Most HCOVs originated from chimpanzees where they are illegal.
Some of the HCOVs are also known as host animals.
Interestingly, in the United States, the number of species that are directly affected by human diseases is estimated to be about one third of the population.
An examination of the CoV-Messing Animals in animals provides an important warning about the Pto Denis CoV.
In this review, we review the knowledge about seven HCOVs, in which we focus on the source and interconnection of their animals along with the history of their research.
The important thing is, we compare different HCOVs with different views of the evolution of different viruses and the restoration of their genes and differentiate between them.
The current CoV disease in the same investigation came under trial of 2019 (COVID-19).
In addition, the needs of successful hosting animals have been highlighted in the prevention of viruses at the rate of change and disease.
Coronavirus is related to the families of Coronardi, including mixed, positive senses, a group of only trapped RNA viruses.
These viruses, such as 26 to 32 c.m. and 32 kilo-bases, between RNA viruses, were said to have been caused by alectran microscope to look like copper.
Naturally, there are non-commercial genetics that are part of a similar organization in the COVs.
In about two thirds of genetics, there are open frames to read the ride on each other (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translates into the map of the polypathies of pp1a and pp1ab.
This cop is also applied to 16 non-commercial terms, nominative or nsp1~16.
In the remaining parts of genetics, the ORFs, the cosmophophe(S), the observatory (M) and the Klulamia (N) are also known as the ORFs.
A large number of non-profits are also encoded through a variety of coded coVs.
On the basis of the difference in the order of Lehmia, the four categories of CoVs are grouped into the four categories of CoVs, Beta-CoV, Gamma-COV and Delta-CoV, with the majority of HCOVs and the rest of the sections (A,B,C and D).
From the fascination of the filogens, it appears that most of the crocodiles and the four are al-CoV and B T-COV's genetics, while gamma-CoV and delta-COV are the largest mammals.
For thousands of years, the CoVs continued to place the barriers of different species, and some of them grew as important human pests.
To this day, seven human CoVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them are HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL6 Al-CoVs.
The other five other five sons -CoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, Koronavarus of pain syndrome (SARS-CoV), Eastern Middle-Emotion syndrome Coronavaires (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
Usually HCOV-229, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 are caused by simple colds such as cold and/or steel.
On the other hand, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and newly identified SARS-COV-2 are highly thinner and more likely to have severe respiratory pain in more patients, along with the greater risk of exposure to cerebral-Corpulmonary infections.
In the mid-1960s, the HCOV-229E's stress, B814 separated those who had a nose exit from those who were less cold.
Since then, more information has been collected through extensive studies conducted on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both due to the signs that limit themselves.
In fact, before the SARS spread, the idea was widely accepted that there is usually no infection with HCOVs.
The SARS epidemic, present in 2003, is the most devastating of the present history, affecting more than 8,000 people with nearly 10% deaths.
Ten years later, as a result of the spread of self-determination (MERS) in the Middle East, the spread of disease in the natural Arab, which spread around the world.
2019 Nov (HCOV (2019-nCOV, which was later named ARS-COV-2, is the nuclear agent of the ongoing Corona virus disease (COVID-19), who took up more than 3,120 lives by March 3, 2020, and more than 91,000 people were affected by it.
And the world has to be ready for the coming world of SARS-COV-2.
All seven HCOVs' source of animals, fourth or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolution of all HCOVs from the original magnets, where viruses express well-represented and non-metal genetics.
COVID-19 has presented numerous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the world.
The source of HCOVs provides a forum for understanding the public of natural history, the power of spread, and the restrictions of migration in different ways.
It can also be helpful to find hostes of SARA-COV-2 with important factors in the future.
In this review, we will review the main animals, intermediary migrations, and copies of HCOVs.
In particular, we promote this shared idea and think that the central viruses of the HCOVs are usually uninhabitable in the host animals of their natural resources and then they become pawns jinx after moving to their new host animal.
We also examine the attitude of the evolution of the HCOVs, which often increase the transfer with a lack in Petto Genk.
The results of the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 have also been considered to be a fraud.
At the end of the 1930s, animals are known to CoVs.
HCOV-229E was separated before B814, before those separated from the locus of small cold patients, the various animals affected by different CoVs were disorganized, the fat, the pork, the bile, and the dog.
In the past decades, seven HCOVs were identified.
The history of the discovery of HCOVs in historical order will be short-lived and educated.
In 1966, HCOV-229E was separated before the breath of the breath of the breath in the breath of the breath of the breath, and later was developed to increase the WI-38 footing bells in lines.
10 to 20 percent of patients affected by HCOV-229E have been exposed to symptoms of cold headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, fevers, and coughs.
Later, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was separated from the culture of the body and then put into the short-lived brain cycle.
The physical characteristics of the HCOV-OC43 infection are seen as people who are HCOV-229E, which are not symbolically different from other respiratory kinases, like influenza A's viruses and desertw viruses.
Both HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 were divided worldwide, and they spread more in the corresponding climate climate during winter.
Usually, these two viruses have less time than a week, after which there are about 2 weeks of sickness.
According to the volunteer study of humans, the impact of healthy people's HCOV-229E produces little cold.
In patients with only a few strength defenses, there is a severe infection in the lower part of the breath tube.
SARS, also known as a general example, was the first best documented as the world's public health due to HCOV in human history and is the SARS-CoV Attololical Agent, the third detected HCOV.
The first SARS case can be put in the Chinese province of Zhanging Dong by the end of 2002.
SARS ’ disease, spread in many countries and continents, resulted in 774 deaths with 8096 deaths.
In addition to rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, in which the sample is between 4 and 7 days of 4 and 10 days of the disease, is at the rate of the viral load and that it can increase about two thirds of cancers.
In patients with SARS-CoV, there are early signs of pain, headaches, fever, fever, depression, and headaches, followed by the symptoms of nervous self, sensitism, sensitism, and respiratory pain.
It's not uncommon to have Jig's unstructured composition and some high-strained screeners in Lemfopania, SARS.
In SARS patients are also exposed to the loss of alcohol, the spread of EChelol cells, and the increase in microorganisms.
Then about 20 to 30 percent of patients require extreme care and mechanical development.
In these severe cases, other than the nasal of a small number of organs, including liver, liver, and kidney, usually accompanied by the cyto them strome, may be affected, especially by less powerful immune patients.
For the first time, this virus was separated from the open-ended biopsy of Indians who traveled to Hong Kong from the Xiwang video.
Since then, great effort has been devoted to the research of HCOV.
HCov-NL63 was separated from a 7 month-old child in the Netherlands during the end of 2004.
Initially, it is found in small children, elders, and low-powered patients with respiratory disease.
In the disease with HCOV-BL63, it is common to have a nose poison, aggravating light, a fever, and a fever.
In another free study, a 8-month sample of the boy’s nose in the Netherlands was described as separating the virus from the nose.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually a global division.
It has been estimated that HCOV-NL63 in normal respiratory disease is approximately 4.7%, and early summer, the weather and the weather are severe.
HCOV-NL63 is linked to the banning union, also known as Karp.
That year, in Hong Kong, a 71-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital due to the excitement of the blues of the blues and veins, HCOV-HKU1 was separated by HCOV-HKU1.
HCOV-HKU1 was reported to have been associated with the severe pain in the community's community and with suffocation.
Similarly HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, which has a mild breath disease, found around the world.
The HCOVs received from these four committees are very good than humans, and generally they are less likely to change the chances of producing extreme yellow disease, although the accidents have been caused by unknown factors, such as HCOV-NL63's more severe anti-accompaniment caused by severe lack of breath, recently reported in China.
Usually when they move HCOV and have the ability to maintain themselves in humans, they become less aggressive pawns genek.
MERS-CoV was first separated from the puppys of a 60-year-old victim in Saudi Arabia, who was a severe pattern and around the world.
Where most of the truth is confirmed in the East of Libertarian, and sometimes in nearby contacts, the export case is found in European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, 186 confirmed cases in South Korea were spread by a continental plague.
MERS' medical skills are similar to SARS, with the characteristics of the developed severe pneumonia.
In contrast to SARS, many MERS suffer a severe lack of neighborhoods, which is very different from MERS in cases caused by HCOV.
More than 30 percent of patients have antidepressants and antidepressants.
By February 14, 2020, there were more than 34.4% of deaths in cases confirmed by Liberty, resulting in one of the most devastating viruses found in MRS-COV humans.
During the end of December 2019, last time China's province Hobby, Vawan, became a large number of people from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has called the COVID-19 as a global public health crisis, pointing out the latest wave of infection in SARS-CoV-2, and the disease is called COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed around the world, with 3.4% of those treated.
Especially, Hobbie, in China, there are 4.2% of these cases, while outside it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-COV and MERS-COV, SARS-COV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections and is presented as fever, cancer, and toxicity.
Some patients have also seen hospitals.
One of the most extreme symptoms is a pattern, and it can increase the salaries of the severe breath.
Although 82% of the high-solv-solv-COV and SARS-COV-2 are constantly combined with each other, this is a band of different branches of the yellow-green tree.
Apparently, SARS-COV-2 is going to move less than SARS-COV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 reported signs of non-signal topics that could be shared around the world rapidly.
In comparison with six other HCOVs of SARS-COV-2, there are many interesting differences and differences.
First of all, HCOVs has a very common occurrence in the period and duration of the disease.
In this case, SARS-COV-2 follows the general attitude of six other HCOVs.
Second, the symptoms of COVID-19 are derived from SARS-COV and the community of other four (HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, it's generally seen that during the encryption of the HCOVs received from the SARS-COV-2 community, Bishmol demonstrates the characteristics of his inflection, with no special, light, or no signs.
On the other hand, a small low-level seat of COVID-19 can also be seen as a SARS-CoV infection, although it's very low.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting features like HCOVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the SARS-COV-2 is so much as the community got HCOVs.
On the other hand, it remains to confirm that like SARS-COV and MERS-COV's cases, the transfer of SARS-COV-2 is slow.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-COV-2 can be found in countless examples.
Although in at least some circumstances whose future studies continue to be explained is that like the case of SARS-CoV, SARS-COV-2 has a significant role in the transmission of the language.
It's also of great interest to see if like the HCOVs received from the community, SARS-CoV-2 will show up in the climate.
In any case, after entering humans, the characteristics of SARS-COV-2 will affect the end of the current wave of COVID-19.
The four HCOVs received from the community well-regulatedly in humans are caused by simple signs.
From the other point of view, it can also be true that humans are well matched by these four HCOVs.
In other words, both types of ancient HCOVs can be saved from the global epidemic.
HCOVs that lead to severe diseases in humans and humans who are victims of severe HCOV diseases have been eliminated.
In order to do this, to a large extent, to fight the host's survival restrictions and to make the most of the purchase change, HCOVs have to be copied among humans.
In this sense, the long term of the SARS-COV-2 and the more people will be affected, the more likely that humans will take it completely.
If it's taken in a good manner, then it's difficult to stop the transfer in humans through other ways that control the counter-infection.
For many years, four CoVs from the community have been moving to the population, resulting in a common cold among those under the control of conflict.
These viruses don't need animal resources.
On the other hand, humans are not well matched by the extreme Petho Genc SARS-COV and MERS-CoV and cannot maintain their transfer to humans.
They need to grow in their animal resources and grow in them, and possibly find an opportunity to spread their senses through one or more middle and wide hosting animals.
SARS-COV-2 has such characteristics as four HCVs derived from both SARS-COV/MERS-COV and the Committee.
At least at this time, it is more capable of moving like HCOVs from the community.
However, this is more complicated than HCOVs received from the community and less than the SARS-CoV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen that humans will take it completely, and it will turn into humans without an animal or a host of animals.
Before talking about the origins of the HCOVs, it will be better to talk about the evolution of the host animals of HCOVs, nature, wastes, middle and wide ranges and their characteristics.
An animal, if she is a close-related ethnic share, she works as a host of HCOVs, sharing high-ranking support on the surface of the nuclear nuclear power plant.
The genetic virus is usually well-explained in this hosting creature, and the unicycle is dangerous.
Similarly, the hoster protects HCOVs constantly and for a long time.
In both cases, hosting animals are naturally affected and HCOV is the natural host of its ex-viruses.
On the other hand, if HCOV communicates with humans before or after it is introduced from the middle hosting animal, this new host can't be better suited and often won.
This intermediate host can act as the source of human infection and then contributes to a large-scale rapid hosting of human infection in humans.
If HCOVs don't keep moving inside the host animal, it's going to be in the closed path of infection.
On the other hand, HCOVs can also communicate between hosting animals and even establish long-term food.
In this case, the middle hosting creature becomes a host of natural resources.
Statistics of epidemics have unsatisfied that SARS has a history of contact with game animals in the Indians Cases.
The post-interpretation investigation said that animal merchants are more likely to differ from the general population to the SARS-CoV lgG.
In the market for living animals, the first of these is the mask pymhotite cats (egooma laroata) and in a ricoon dog known to be SARS-CoV, which is similar to SARS-CoV.
It serves as a guideline to the fact that there is no SARS reported after killing all of the hotels in the market.
However, it has been reported that the mask pymethites from forest fields were very negative for SARS-CoV without a view to living animals' market, which may seem to indicate that the mass of mass-duty pacific water bottles are only served as a medium host living, but these are not the natural reserves of SARS-COVs.
In particular, because 80% of the population of the Viganging Vio have the ED body of SARS-CoV in different animals, the vast majority of small animals that breast-feed the SARS-CoV can't be attributed to the release potential for working as host animals.
These are all seen as hosting animals off the SARS.
SARS-COV's natural hosting animal leaking has led to a closer related CoV, which is called the Rinolofus Chimgader CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), which is located in a Chinese horse-powered spider.
These chimpanzees are anti-SARS-COV anti-dibody positive and the SARS-Rh-BatCOV HKU3 genetic damage.
This and the other bats share 92-88% of the 100-year-old content with the CoV SARS-COV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new idea that the chimpanzees are the hosting animals of human heritage.
The majority of SARS type is also identified as CoV (SL-COVs), but none other than a noun or WIV1 can be separated as a living virus.
Human Human Human Weapons Change Engine 2 (ACE2) is called the adoption of SARS-CoV.
From the example of the chimpanzees, WIV1 was shown to be used as a study of the cell of magnets, hot cats, and human ACE2.
Interestingly, Sierra’s healthy SARS patients were under attack by WIV1.
Up to now, WIV1 represents the most closely related SARS-CoV, which shares 95 percent of the 100-Tided Balance.
In spite of the extreme similarities between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not directly a carrier of SARS-CoV and that the spiders are not hosting the host of the FARS-COV devices.
This group's MERS-COV's shirt was based on CoV-HKU4 and the Bat CoV-HKU5, the full genetic analysis.
Batt uses CoV-HKU4 and MERS-COV, a representative receptor for entering the virus, dipel peptides 4 (DP4).
From Europe and Africa, we're closer to my goals in Batbe Ta-CoV, the RNA polymers susceptible police genetically.
Until now, no living MERS-CoV can be found in wild leopards.
MERS-COV and its closely related byte coV-HKU25 share only 87 percent of the total data content.
In this way, the host can't be a living creature of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East learned that in several African countries, like the camels of the Middle East, there is a well-known camels of the MERS-COV-elected Antibody.
The MERS-COV, which is linked to humans, was separated by a cobbler's nose, and it further indicates that the camels serve as the real host of MERS-COV.
It is noteworthy that, as an experimented with MERS-COV, the camels were generally seen with mild symptoms but large-scale virus tubes.
Especially from the affected camels, it's not only the way of the breath but also the rich-language path, which is the main way to the virus's tube from the chamgars.
But there are still questions because before the beginning of the signs, there is no history of being associated with the average number of cases confirmed by MERS, which includes moving from human beings to unknown animals, which protect MERS-COV.
In contrast to the SARS-COV-2 RAT13 Bat, 96.2 percent share the nuclear prototype.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-COV's cases, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are good at assigning middle-age relationships.
I mean, the byte SARS-COV-2 directly cannot be the host of the resource until there are almost a few given bat CoVs in the future.
Probably, the salt-eating egg, which has many early casses of COVID-19 and which are possibly pointing to transfer from animal to human, I'll be the host animals between sales and killing wild animals, including SARS-COV-2.
A number of recent studies based on the meta-CoV-2 have suggested that a group of endangered small animals that are known as pengolon (Mans Yenica) can also be protected by the ABBB data CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These nine pengoulin CoV genetics share in the addition of a %85-92 nuclear tube tidal with SARS-COV-2.
However, these units are so close to RaTG13 with approximately %90 identification at the level of the tablets.
These files are such as SARS-COV-2 viruses in the genetic tree, one of which is consistently identified by the fact that one of the %97.4 AUSDs, thus sharing with SARS-COV-2's Dropper Banding Domain (RBD).
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 are more consistent, despite the high degrees of regular genetics.
In the past studies about the sick Pygolin were reported to meet with the presence of a wheelchair, such as the related SARS-CoV-2.
This study has adopted a variety of Assembly methods and subsidies, which are approximately 86.3% of the total length of viral genetics.
We can't extract the possibility that Pongolon is one of the host animals between SARS-CoV-2.
However, the differences between the Ba Taa CoVs of current SARS-CoV-2 and Pingolon SARS-CoV-2 have not directly met the support of SARS-COV-2.
Also, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is smaller than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and Pingolon SARS-COV-2.
SARS-COV-2 continues to be the evolution route in animals that are chewing gums, pengolons, and other dairy products.
Despite the best support of SARS-CoV-2 and pengolon, the difference between SARA-CoV-2 is found in Beta CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are the best widely distributed genetic support.
It's a very rare figure that, with SARS-COV-2 and Pagolin SARS-CoV-2, is active through the highly-resplicating properties of high-quality technology in the BAT COVs domain.
The type of wild animals has been suggested in response to Beta CoVs and RATG13 between pengallon SARA-COV-2.
The Beta CoVs spread the balconies on the surface, as an explanatory force in evolution.
The SARS-CoV-2 is still to be decided on the direct evidence source.
In addition to the extreme fallout HCOVs, HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 have been studied to be the key source.
The genetic evidence shows that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E's original sources can be bat CoVs, while HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1's primary viruses have been found in rats.
It has been reported that a byte coV in the northern United States banking byte has shown a close relationship with the HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E genetically, another byte coV, was called the day-to-day headquarters/19/2008, which went to the gate, is suspected of being a host of the media.
For explanation, existing knowledge about the source of the known HCOVs has been concluded in form1 and angle2.
The genetic analysis of files has provided evidence of the events of transferring HCOVs into history.
When the home HCOV-OC43 crossed the virus to impress humans around 1890, the World Wide Web of Sans' Infection was recorded.
The history of HCOV-229E is less clear.
Bat Ala-CoVs has been closely related to HCOV-229E.
There's an alpkafia CoV between them.
The vast majority of evidence supports the direct transfer of viruses to humans.
First, in the joint ecosystem, there can be no contact with the crocodiles or the alps.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the Bat Infoa CoVs, related to HCOV-229E, is traditional and non-regulated in the CoVs boat, while alpkafa CoV is due to spreading respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, Alpka Happya has not been found in the CoV pet.
This is how the possibility that the alpaks receive HCOV-229E from humans.
In fact, human beings are directly chimpled by the photonic virus, the basmol ribbees virus, the abola virus, the Nipha virus, and the Honduras virus.
So it's not too surprising that the magnet can direct HCOV-229E into human beings.
As alternative, where Batefa CoVs serve as an HCOV-229E genetic pool, there are alps and camels like MERS-CoV cases that transfer viruses to humans as intermediate representatives.
MERS-COV works as a good example of a cobblering camel and camels moving in humans through the interlocked alanua.
The Evolution Source of MERS-CoV in the Chambers is known as its initial identity and is strengthened by the subsequent results.
Apparently, the genetics provide a full-scale pool of leather wires for the migration of the locusts and aliens and international markets.
The long-term age, the guinea population callons, the stronger social cooperation and the strong ability to join, an example for the chamgars to become the carriers.
On the other hand, MRS-CoV is being introduced to the camels of the Golden Age.
It has been well-organized in the camels which have changed directly from hosting animals into a safe and natural habitat.
MERS-COV maintains a relatively mild disease and relatively low rate change in animals.
Its human beings have sometimes been an accident and humans are hosters because they can't maintain their migration.
Unlike the role of the camels in exchange for MERS-COV, the role of the pengolon, if there is one, is different.
Especially, Pongvalon B. Ta-CoVs is extremely thin in pengolon.
Maybe they're a host of people who live on the road to SARS-COV-2B T-CoV, which corresponds to hot balls in the SARS-COV case.
In future studies, animals can include the many possibilities of the SARS-COV-2 interconnected migration.
First of all, the crocodile SARS - CoV-2, which is nearly the same as the normal virus SARS-CoV-2, can be the host squared.
Humans share the environmental gap with the chimpanzees through the canoes.
Second, Pinglon can be one of the fast middle hosting creatures, with SARS-COV-2 related viruses new introductions.
Humans draw closer to viruses by means of gossip and hunting.
It is possible that animals that have multiple milked animals, including domestic animals, are victims of SARS-COV-2.
The EC body is guaranteed in the report of domestic and wild animals.
Third, as stated above, the left of SARS-CoV-2 can be born in the third environment that connects to both the chicken and the penganese.
The search for the source of the SARS-COV-2 continues.
Besides different kinds of hosting animals, CoVs is important in providing three major public services by the viral to accommodate several types of obstacles.
First of all, the DNA is the more variable of them.
Compared to the second single stranded RNA viruses, the ratio of coVs can be viewed as environmentally acceptable, while each site has the average replacement rate of each year, depending on the level of the male hosting animal's CoV.
CoVs have pro-reading outdoors, which, in turn, lead to better exchanges, attention loss, or invasive delays.
It's interesting that Kleu TiedEttag Remedicio is known to suppress the copying of CoVs by blocking the foreign bonocles and RNA-related RNA polarases.
There is the highest amount of agent tested as the SARA-COV-2 in rededuced medical practice.
In any case, the rate of the CoVs exchange is one million times greater than its hosting animals.
Also, often when CoVs cannot adapt well to the hosting animal, it has a higher rate of replacement.
Compare the highest rate of SARS-CoV, so that the SARA-COV-2 is a low rate of change in people who adapt well.
Probably, it's already merged into another hosting animal near humans.
In addition to the SARS-COV-2, the MRS-CoV that fits well into the camels of a Koban.
Practically, it is not likely that the proposed genetics made vaccines and anti-SARS-COV-2 have an immediate negative effect.
Second, genetics in CoVs show the use of extra-representation in the genetic configuration for large RNAs and bubbies, thus increasing the efficiency of the interrelation, which is useful for the appearance of virtual coVs when circumstances are appropriate.
It is supported by the help of the 3-year-olds who read a number of different numbers to the end of the genetics and the role of lehamia.
Third, KoV through the unique meminism of the country's election, often switches into RNA suffocating.
In imitation of the CoV RNA, the hosteer working as an aquarium, has a lot of change in the dor.
The maximum length of homologous to create new CoVs can be the resilience of intelligent genetic RNAs.
In both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, the same as the CoVs of Animals found in SL-COV and Bat CoV-HKU9.
WIRELESS FROM THE PAST
In addition to the three publicities of the above viral, there is an important element in the viral cooperation and inter-intervention transport with the host's livelihood.
With this, the SARS-CoV's bubi is taken as a common example, who provided positive selection during inter-intermediate migration.
In addition to the previous analysis of the SARS-CoVs of Man and Diet, SARS-CoV's different hosting animals, especially with the change of Slamia's reception binding domain, the idea of moving rapidly.
In general, the CoV's Slamia's reception is supported by the Banding Dou Clinic Response and is widely selected by the host's Antibody Response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain on the S1 piece is 510 from 338v to 510 peace-posed, which belongs to human ACE2 and the viral Internet.
The SARS-CoV is capable of identifying the ACE2 receptor for the receptor binding domain that allows various animals, bascule leather, brick biles, cholas, and raccoon dogs, who allow the transfer of viruses to the elvas.
In fact, only 6 o'clocks remains in the receptor binding domain were found isolated in the portals of man and woman Belle, with 4 of them being in the form of a receptor binding to cooperate with the receptor of ACE2.
There are K479N and S487T modifications in the Diet SARS-CoV's receptor binding domain, which can enhance the cooperation of the NCOE2 receptor with the human ACE2.
In other words, these two self-subsid humans can prove to be an essential reasonable alternative to the similarity of the viral.
It's worth mentioning that SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 shares a single cell receptor.
The difference between S1TS-COV-2 and SARS-Cov in the S1 cent indicates that human ACE2's needs change.
Of course, the study of a turbidity electronic care is pointing to the relationship between the human ACE 2 and the SARS-CoV's Slamia from 10 to 20 times.
It would also be interesting to determine if any other advanced receptor would need to be moved to SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is also connected to ACE2 but different parts of S.
There are many other HCOV receptionors, such as Au Puppeptides N for HCOV-229E, and 9-O-O-vietated nuclear acid for HCOV-OC43.
They can monitor the success of these CoVs after moving through their host animals to humans.
Besides cell receptors, HCOV is maintained by the result of the inter-international migration, by relying on another host animal, and by means of the restricted public.
The natural habitats of humans and HCOVs, such as crocodiles, camels and cattle, and the spread of these hostels can be a barrier to foreign transport.
In HCOVs, a successful intermediary migration is a publicized host of creatures who are being forced into the streets of the angry host living creatures.
In this case, this vital part of the hosting community of the virus remains to be identified and maintained.
The host animal dependence and the non-profit of public for SARS-CoV-2 can benefit from the use of modern technology by CRISPR.
Number of HCOVs: Go back to zero ground.
But KoV's downturn provides plenty of opportunities for HCOVs.
In this sense, Butt CoVs serves as an HCOVs gene barrier.
In addition, rapid and genetically modified Turkey also contributed to the evolution of HCOVs and served as two important steps in this process.
For example, the adoption of the Nool Lamamiti Koding Gene, for example, has the ability to rapidly transform the viral's phenotype.
In the aid of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered important in the harmony of humans, such as separating the viruses of the BAT related to SARS-COV, but there are different types of ORF8 in it.
At the beginning of the human plague, the Strategic Strategic Strategic Centers reported that there were 29 nuclear satellites in the 29th century.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is a corresponding transformation that promotes migration to host animals.
In addition, the history of re-insurgent Turkey with SARS-CoV and gamma-CoVs, where RNA polarizes in large numbers of re-renewable smaller areas.
The location of the market was identified by nsp9, most of the nsp10, and in some parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been seen that MRS-COVW, who was in a corner of the camels in Saudi Arabia, had to experience the events of re-tweets between various generations.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, repeated Turkish events have also been observed in other CoVs, with HCOVs rebound with other animal CoVs.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unexplained changes in viral genes, possibly avoiding selection, such as rescue from host animals' strength defense systems.
An example of its effects is the loss of the entire length of ORF4 in HCOV-229 E.
Although HCOV-229E can be observed to maintain ORF4 in the variables of the camel, alpka show the entry of a single CF-CoV, which results in a frame shift.
The last but not least, the New HCOVs evolution is also employed by the selected mouse in the hosting animals of their resources.
When chimpanzees are affected by CoVs, there is a lack of signs or light signs, which marks the harmony between the CoVs and the Chambers.
This shows that the magnets have good balance with the anatomies and physically coVs.
For example, advocates of sweating in the chamgars effectively reduce the pressure by using the CoVs to activate the response.
Also, the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the large Westcombilian Komplix class I are overwhelmed by the low levels of expression.
Further, reactivate the high level of oxygen produced by the upper meta speech activity (ROS) by suppressing the copying of both coVs, and as affected by the pro-reducing of provocative bonals, to create a high-level gene virus station, when a new host is introduced.
More anti-racist CoV stations can be re-combined through Turkey, making it possible for the host to be able to say the characteristics of the nool tolerances or eligibility of the hosting animal.
So, it's not agreed that there are three types of HCOVs on the two lines.
CoVs are caused by non-fatal gene or simple signs in their storage hosting animals, such as chamgars and camels.
They are hardly able to copy without the protective response of the powerful hosting creature.
In this, the secrets of why non-signal diseases are shown and the cause of severe cases in human infection are hidden.
The acute symptoms are primarily due to hyperactivity of the immune response and the cyto from them strome, with a stronger resistance, more frequent damage to the hips.
On the other hand, in a non-signal disease strike, the immune response has become more than a copy of the CoV.
The same wise practice is beneficial in treating conflicting SARA-CoV-2.
In particular, the reactions of the Internet in the chamgars are particularly powerful.
So, the organization of type I-infraffron should benefit from at least the first aspect of SARS-COV-2 in humans.
In addition, the NLRP3 concentration in the champagne is defective.
That's why it can be useful to prevent NLRP3 from treating COVID-19 with MCC950.
The loss of SARS-COV-2 follows the general idea that emerges by SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Where there is a share of the SARS-CoV of a Chemand Beta CoV with the SARS-CoV, there's a byte -CoV which shares the same amount of SARS-CoV-2 with the SARS-COV-2.
While Indians and other animals have been sheltered with viruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is not directly identified by the middle host.
Pingolon Beta CoVs has been amazingly known to be the homologous of SARS-CoV-2, which means that the pongolons are working with one of the most vulnerable animals or that the pengan Bay T-CoVs can share in the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately created by man.
The SARS-CoV-2 has returned to light.
The CoVs study in chimpanzees and other animals has changed our thoughts about animal origins in human migration and the presence of HCOVs.
Widely known as martyring is the source of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and it has moved into humans through a middle host of animals.
Seeing that SARS-CoV's infestation is caused by the interaction between humans and hot springs, so that the meat's eggs are closed and the potos can be effectively eliminated by killing the SARS.
That's why, in view of the discovery of a wide range of pengolons from SARS-CoV-2, the pengolons should be removed from the flesh to prevent the movement from moving from animals.
However, the future investigation continues to explain when and where humans move through SARS-COV-2 pengools and other milk-solving animals.
On the other hand, MRS-CoV has been in the camels of a long time.
For local people, these camels serve as the main means of transport, including meat, milk, skin and anion.
They are largely in the Middle East and Africa.
So, like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to stop the spread of China, there is no need to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS.
In order to prevent the recent spread of MERS, with other measures that control the infection, the camels need to look for a qualification to create an effective vaccine against MERS.
Since we are not capable of eliminating these viruses, it can cause new genetic types.
In the woods, species are orbiting the CoVs of animals.
In particular, crocodile CoVs are very different with race in animals.
As a result of the demand for new CoVs that are more moving and/or channels to humans in the future, Jawar CoVs has many opportunities to be ready and reinvigorated.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact with humans and animals, wild animals must abandon the culture of eating wild animals in some places in China.
With the trials of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, the best preparation and reaction plans should be at their place.
In fact, there has been a long time on the virus planet.
They live in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to grow.
Although there are many characteristics that cause the spread of viruses, if taught people can reduce the opportunities for communication with humans and other wildlife species.
CoV and its natural hostess require constant care of the milking animals, which move from the animal to humans, and can be imported into its later spread control.
As a result, the virus can be prevented more effectively from being infected by animals by avoiding the environmental barrier of the viruses that transmit humans to humans.
There's still a number of holes in the ground that lead to SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the chamgar moves a species of SARS-COV-2 into Pangolon, it would be interesting to see that the chamgars and pongolons can share the same environmental power under conditions.
Second, if the magnet is more direct in transferring to man, it should be determined how humans come in contact with birds.
Third, if a third milking animal serves as a real middle representative, it must explain how they cooperate with other species, including humans, leopards, and penguins.
In the end, because many other milking animals, including domestic animals, can be sensitive to SARS-COV-2, so both their supervision and experience should be held.
If there is a peanut, penglon, or a milk feeding animal, it is expected that in the future, the SARS-COV-2 and its primary viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural representations.
The ongoing research in this field will explain the evolution of SARS-Cov-2 in animals with the block of COVID-19 in humans and have a significant impact on control.
COVID-19 is necessary to improve the quality of the analysis of cascades and images.
On February 6, 2020, our team published a fast-paced guide for analysis and treatment of the 2019 Nov Coronavirus (2019-nCOV), which provides our experience and is a good point to fight the global epidemic.
However, Coronavirus disease is a new disease in 2019 (COVID-19), on the basis of the results of ongoing research and medical experience in our awareness and knowledge; so, research and treatment strategies are constantly refreshing.
In this letter, we call our guidance, which has been issued by the National Health Committee of the Republic of Georgia, but a comment answered by saying that COVID-19 (seventh Version) has provided the current level of analysis and treatment.
In December 2019, the 2019 Nov Coronavirus (2019-nCOV), now officially known as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been named as the \"SARS-COV-2\" and has had severe side effects in breathing the virus.
On 11 March 2020, WHO called COVID-19 the World Wide Fund.
To fight the SARS-COV-2 infection, our team has developed a fast-paced guide and has published online on February 2020 in the Military Medical Research.
He's got more attention after the publication.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, on the basis of the results of our awareness and knowledge, and the experience of medical care is increasing rapidly; so, research and treatment strategies are also constantly refreshing.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued a program of analysis and treatment for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with seven of its total figures from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, with some major changes in the context.
Now our instruction has received a comment from the Visual At All, and they have suggested that it be easier to post their medical experience based on it.
Their work included new moons for our guidance, and it is a valuable asset for the world around the world.
We're going to support their obvious work and thank them.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the COVID-19's (the latest exam version) and the latest analysis and treatment guidelines of current studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis of medical history with two sources of medical history is needed, without the obvious history of the plague:
History of Anti-Terrorism Diseases: (1) Wohan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where the COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days before the beginning of the symptoms have been reported; (2) the history of the history of travel residence; (2) the history of communication with various cases of SARS-COV-2; (3) the city and other communities around the state of Worohan, where the first 14 days have been reported by COV-19 people in the first 14 days since the beginning of the period, including the history of the history of those in the city of Bausan people in the area of the past 14th century, including those in the small areas of the town of the school and 2th century.
Medications: (1) fever and /ia breath symptoms; (2) with the conceptual features of COVID-19; (3) the number of red blood cells in the early stages of the study shows little, less lymphocytes.
One of the following drugs should be evaluated with one of the following products: (1) the fact that a PCR test for the SARS-COV-2 is relevant; (2) the basis for the general general genetics showing the upper hand of the Koronauliers; (3) the trial of SARS-CoV-2 for the specific GM body and the GG body; the SARC-V-GGO-GGP for SARV-GGGGGGE is a severed-down.
We can see that the real-time PCRE test for the encyclopedic acid was included in the second 18th January 2020 and the third (January 22, 2020).
In blood samples, the pattojoan was incorporated into the fourths (27 January 2020) and the fifths (8 February 2020); and the circumnavigable honey was included in the seventh census.
The research-based modification continues to be carried out by searching for more than one leaf of the nuclear acid to analyze the evidence standard, as well as a sample of the nasal basmol blood that increases the availability of different models, and contributes to the positive results of the specific antibiotics.
And there are also many martyrs who remind us of the care of traditional signs and non-signal patients.
So, the video chart of the Zoo et al-Ale should be updated, because they have set up individuals in serious risk without medical symptoms.
The school system also needs to be confirmed in further medical exercises and studies.
As a result, we ask for more direct evidence to present our impressions to readers.
For an analysis of the news case and photographs, we suggest them to cover and follow the current guidelines names in their native countries.
To offer help, our team refreshes our direction.
In Bangladesh, COVID-19 has reported five new deaths, which are the most common daily deaths.
Last day, Bangladesh Dish confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
It's one of the most fatalities in one day because of virus.
By the same time, Bangladesh's disease economy, control of diseases, and research (IEDCR) said that the number of recorded affected cases included 114 active cases and 33 health health health health cases that were being at home.
As a result, 17 deaths have been recorded.
Commenting on the details in an online line, Dr. McDCR's director Dr. Sabrina Flora said that four men in deaths include a woman.
According to Dr. M.J., two cases were over 60 years old, between two 51 and 60, and one was 41 to 50 years old.
He also said that the people of the cave were two in the midst of destruction.
On March 11, World Health (WHO) announced the global epidemic of COVID-19.
A member of the Hospital reported to the Inado Agency, a local news agency, that was one of the most glorious Allhaman of the deaths, the director of the Bangalilian Insided Bad title, who was in a hospital in Haiti.
On the weekend, in an online video announcement, the Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridge's Vice President said that public transportation has been blocked for a long time since the initial planned week.
Initially, this block of public transportation began on March 26, and on April 4, it was planned to end the week of the week.
Important sources-- medical equipment, fuels and food-- still allowed for transportation.
On March 8, the first incident of the COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was two people who came back from Italy and recorded one of them's wife.
By 19 March, these three were already healthy.
SARS-COV-2 has crossed the global level of 10 million inflections.
On Fridays, John Hopkins University's figure pointed out that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 Corona virus infection has been over a million.
Nearly 52 thousand deaths have been associated with COVID-19, it's the disease that comes from the Corona virus.
The sad day came when Malawi confirmed its former corona virus infection, and the first death in Zambia was the case with Corona virus.
Up to the same collection, North Korea claimed that it is one of the few countries that are still free from the infection of the Corona virus.
By tomorrow, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,32 after 10 p.m. 20 hours in Central Europe, according to 4 April.
In the United States, more than 24,000 cases of Corona virus were recorded.
CBS News reported that over 1,000 American deaths were due to the identification of the Corona virus to the population of the John Hopkins University.
Throughout the world, countries have announced strong measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

Australia’s Stutterers reduced the rate of Tshoe Papers per lane
In the days of Sunday and week, Australia’s Stutterers' Prisons Wally and Colliss have reduced the trade restrictions of Albatross Paper on every lane and to one pack on the Internet.
On the day of Nisan, ALDI also introduced a pack.
These limits were posted as messages on check oots, and Facebook pages of chains.
Because of the fear of COVID-19, people were reported to store it by buyers if they needed self-regulated isolation.
For the poor, Wolverine also restricted the sale of al-Qaeda's Tshu Paper to a pack on every order.
These changes will follow the four pack restrictions on each Lane religion, which was introduced last March 4 and 5th March.
Coyles, on March 8, said that with the ban of four packs on the same site, there are still sales within one hour of relief in many stores, and that demand was considered an example, while the ALDI saw the Tuesday on a Facebook post, changing it.
According to the Wolvern translation, last week's sales had a powerful increase.
In Canberra, the Costa Rican store also limits the allowed number of times last week to two packs.
To reduce famine, Coils ordered large packets from those who provided backups and increased the relief relief, Voltery ordered additional storage, while ADLI stored for special starters on the day of the project.
Russell Zimmerman, an assistant director of the Australian Food Eaters Association, tried to increase food supply, but the restrictions on the local council's time-consuming trucks made it difficult.
They try to meet and do something special, except for the growing generation losses.
In Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the storage rate, some stores can't run a specific body.
Gary Martymer, an expert at the Coinland University of Technology, wrote a report in News.com.au that stores the night.
He said that the tshopper is a big thing, which makes its number less stored, and, when sold, leaves the scope of the shelf empty, which makes it hard to see.
Russell Zimmeri examines the ABC News, including coal and vulver [that] if there are a lot of things on the shelf, such as al-Qaedra and Centiser [can] go to the product and if it's in the amount, you can reduce the pressure rate.
The person who created a scraper's recycled elastic elbow said they'd be without storage.
According to News.com.au, the Chemical Clarke, who makes a glass of glass, and solars who create a sunburn, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
A site of sale and sale said that some of those selling goods in Hobart offer the first free-to-do-distanced tushaw paper, while the buyers had time for the long week of the labor day when they were at the end of the long week.
The number of nTs hidden in daily Darron, included eight pages of analysis, which means they would be cut and used as an al-Qaedr's tissue paper.
According to a report from ABC Australia on March 3, Stores actually avoided the restrictions, about which they said there is no plan to promote banning their buyers.
Russell Zimmeri also said that there is a greater demand for other products including Moscow, satellites, dry appliances, hand washing, and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, out of Australia, the British Super Market purchases were observed to be limited to 12 rollers' packs.
Global Health declared COVID-19 to accept global epidemics.
On Wednesday, World Society Health (WO) announced the ongoing spread of COVID-19 that the disease caused by Coronavirus SARS-COV-2 is the global epidemic.
Although the immune system refers to a rapid recovery of a disease, not to how dangerous certain matters are, global health emphasized the need for action by governments.
Even all countries can change the face of this world.
If countries find their people in response, check, treat, clear, monitor them and connect them.
We are more concerned with the formation of both joints of the disease due to its high levels of air and its high levels of intensity and anxiety against it.
According to Dr. Tom Friedin, a former director for the prevention and prevention of mental disorders, it is a global epidemic.
They found no such restraint since the beginning of the World War II, in their discussions published in NA, in February.
Gaberris showed the same idea, saying that we didn't even have a global coverage that was accessible from the Couroravirus.
He continued: and we haven't seen the world before that which could be controlled at the same time.
In January, the World Health Organization’s New Year’s New Year’s announcement of international concern to the health of the world’s public was issued.
Dr. Anthony Fossey, director of the National Allgeon and several anti-ethylotics, said about this old wave, this is what it is going to lead to further destruction.
The Associated Press reported that the number of people with COVID-19 in the world up to the same collection was 1260,000, resulting in 4600 deaths.
The current current global global epidemic of 2019-20 Coronavirus is a form of coronaryvirus disease (COVID-19), which is characterized by severe self-esteem psychovirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
On December 2019, this plague was symbolized in the city of China, Wahwan, and on January 30, 2020, international concern was announced as a public health emergency, and 11 March 2020 was identified as a global plague.
By April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million patients of COVID-19 reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 34,000 people have been treated.
The rate of deaths in China has been estimated to be 4%, while it starts at %13.04 at the world site and jumps up to %08 in New Zealand.
His common symptoms include fever, coughs, and breathing.
There are signs of severe pain in developing patterns and breathing.
From the appearance of the disease to the beginning of the symptoms, it is usually about five days, but it can be in the range of two to four days.
There's no known vaccine or specific nuclear therapy.
Early treatment is an antidepressant and antidepressant treatment. The recommended care measures include the presence of other patients, facial expression, distance from other people, and care for those who suspect that they are affected.
The world’s officials have supported travel restrictions, trade restrictions, carfuca work, business ventures, business ventures, and the use of services.
The global epidemic in many global social institutions called for a celebration of revolution, hunger, politics, and culture, and became a large part of the economy's economy.
Schools and universities in the country in 1933 were closed at the regional level, with approximately 99.4 percent of the world's population affected.
There were misunderstandings about viruses and misconceptions about Chinese people, East and South East Asia and other peoples and peoples and peoples of different backgrounds and backgrounds.
With low-speed and massive industry closures, there is a shortage of culture and carbon waste in the country.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities in the city of Wahwan (represented in the state of Southern Province) reported a conference of monotonia cases caused by an unknown cause, and a study was started in early January 2020.
Most of these events are related to the airborne water pool, which is why it is thought that it is part of the virus's tropical disease.
The virus from which it is known as SARS-COV-2 is a new discovered virus, known as the Chemgad River, which had a close relationship with the Chemgad Corrunaviers, Pingol and Corrunaviers, and SARS-CoV, the first person who came to face the symptoms of the disease should be able to say 1 December 2019, if he was sick, and the person's disorder should not be associated with the disease.
Two thirds of the initial events reported in December 2019 relate to markets.
On 13 March 2020, the Morning Post of South China recommended that a 55-year-old man in Hobby Province on November 17, 2019 was the first to be one of the first to receive a 55th-year-old person in Hobby Province. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Report reported that although the events in China were slow, but with a sudden rise in events in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new events from China became more than the first time to new events in China.
It may also be that the number of events is reduced, especially among those who refrain from the common symptoms of illness.
On February 26, 19th and less young people reported relatively few incidents around the world, with 2.4% of global events being reported by the French scientist Petek Vince estimated that 60% of Britain’s population would be affected by the result of an effective campaign.
According to government protocol, events are the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have been confirmed to have a positive outcome.
By March 23, no country has tested 3% of its population, and in many countries this official policy is that only those with minor symptoms will not be tested, such as in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 was published in China that approximately 86% of patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 until January 23, and that this unregistered patient was able to provide 79% of the information available to patients.
A statistical analysis published on March 30, estimated that the number of people affected in Italy was much higher than the case.
For COVID-19, see the initial citation number (R0) 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the management and prevention team has been concluded that it can be 5.7.
COVID-19.
For those who don't hold back, the period between 6 and 41 days from the appearance of illness to death, the most common day is 14 days.
Also, by 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, about 80% of the deaths aged over 60 years old and 75% of people already have diseases in the population are the cases of mass loss and the official number of deaths from the World Wide Fund, which is generally the case of the COVID test.
The real number of deaths from COVID-19 is much greater than that, because they do not include those who die without tests -- such as at the home, in the Narcissing Air, or in the Air.
In part from Italy, the number of additional deaths in the world is higher than x4-5 in the official number of deaths from COVID.
A translation of the CDC's control and prevention of the diseases of Rheumatism, admitted that it is known that [the number of people] is reduced to reports of reduced numbers of people in the United States. Such brief reports are often reported throughout the world, such as the first 9th January 20th of the 20th century during the 2009 H.C.E.
The first death out of Sir Land China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia ended on February 14, France.
By February 28, outside of central China, more than a dozen deaths occurred in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13th, more than 40 countries and letters, give news of deaths, from every continent, from the Pacific South.
With the passing of the region and time, the number of deaths is different, and the number of deaths has been divided over events that are considered to be the standard of testing, treatment, treatment options, the early outbreak of the epidemic, the age of the population and the quality of the population.
On the basis of the June Hopcan University figure, also on April 10, 2020, there are 6.0% of world disasters and events (97,039/1,617,204).
The number in the line is different.
In China, the incidence of deaths and deaths from the beginning of the epidemic is 17.3% reduced to 1.7% since the beginning of the disease (from February 2020) and increased by 0.7% (for people who have died of disease) (CFR) in other cases, showing the percentage of victims who die of this disease, and the increase in the number of people who are infected with HIV (FR) who die from one of them.
These numbers are not for a period of time, and from the infection to the final solution of the matter to a specific population.
Many experts have tried to count this number for a specific population.
The Center of Medicine, based on evidence from Oxford University, has estimated that the world's population rate of deaths from infection is between 0.1% and 0.139%.
This analysis corresponds to a statistical study that analyzes the effects of testing on COVID-19 in Germany before COVID-19.
WHO claims that this global epidemic can be controlled.
The outbreak of this disease and the final period of the palace are different and uncertain.
Bonnie, a pen-steat University's flyer, said, is not to be confused, so the vast spread usually boils like the surface, and begins to fall down first when the disease doesn't get more host.
But that's not exactly what it's about when it's going to be, now there's a fair plan.
The Chinese government's top medical minister Zong Nashhan stressed that by June, if all countries are motivated to follow his advice about the measures of global health care prevention.
On March 17, fourski told the Adam of the London School of High and Traditional Medicine that SARS-CoV-2 would continue to rotate for just one or two years.
According to the study of Imperial College in the head of New Ferguson, distance from each other and other measures will be needed until no vaccine is available (at least 18 months or more).
Well, I don't think it's going to be completely overcorruption because it's an easy transition, and it's going to turn into a climate illness, and it's going to come back every year.
The destruction of the return would depend on the reduction of the U.S. movement and its replacement.
COVID-19 causes the symptoms of the disease to be somewhat unsure, and the victims may be without signs.
Two common signs include fevers (88%) and dry cornea (68%).
Less common signs include tecaut, the birth of blagam in the street, the end of the breath, the pain of strokes and joints, the smell of the throat, the smell, the smell, the smell of blood, and the presence of blood in the body, the global health report says that nearly one of the four people suffers from severe sickness and suffering with it.
The prevention and prevention of the disease (CDC) include the list of emergency symptoms: pain in breathing, chronic stress in breathing, sudden seizure, seizures, and face-to-face seizures; if these symptoms are present, it is suggested to take immediate relief - it may lead to severe salts, severe respiratory disease, heart disease, bleeding, and death.
Some of these victims may be without signs, they are surrounded by confirmed patients without medical symptoms, so researchers have issued the recommendation that they want to take close care of the patients who are infected with confirmed patients and to avoid infection.
Without China, the population of diseases is estimated to be from a few numbers to %44.
Usually, the period of dexteration (between the beginning and the beginning of symptoms) is about 14 days; it is usually five days; for example of uncertainty, the end of the gold spill between COVID-19+ and 30% of people affected by COVID-19+ was initially lost in the first 30% of the population which later dropped to 15%.
It is also being made clear how the disease affects, its most positive image.
It is thought that this disease is initially caused by close relationships, and that there was a time when it was born from the chimpanzees, chimpanzees, chimpanzees, and close contact between 1 or 6 meters (3 to 6 feet) between the next two feet.
The study has shown that non-profits can be ranging from 15 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that viruses can also feed on these poisonous beans that live in the air for longer periods of time that occur in the air during the speech, and that when breathing is removed, they may also produce a self-regulated waste of time, even when it is not usually in the air.
These walls can enter the faces of the people, or they may enter the paupers when they breathe.
As with medical practices such as oral nilli and artificial means of conveying mouth-to-face breathing (CPR) to the heart of the nervous system, it can take place in this way.
It can even be seen when a affected surface is touched and first touches its nose, nose, or mouth.
Even though there are fears that they can smell even from the face, the danger is less considered.
The government has rejected the possibility of transferring SARS-COV-2 from the body to the first three days before the outbreak of virus, although it is also possible in the last phase of disease and disease.
Since people’s symptoms have a positive effect three days before the beginning of the disease, it is believed that it is possible before the spread of disease.
There have been only a few confirmed incidents in the library where there have been no symptoms of illness, but without the lack of signs on the subject in many countries.
Europe’s Centre of Control and Prevention reports that although it is not entirely clear how easily this disease can be detected, one usually affects two or three people - it can live on different surfaces for hours.
In particular, on Plast (poli propulin) and 304 Spain Las Sty, the virus was discovered for three days, for a day and four hours on a tub.
However, this is a different period in lower and higher temperatures. The tests of COVID-19 in the pool and other animals have been positive.
There is no doubt that this virus can be transferred to humans as well as to any British official animal, such as when it comes to contacting other surfaces.
The Great Depression Symptoms 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a novel virus, which is first isolated from the three men who were in a pattern that would be associated with a group of severe mental illness in the city of Vooran.
Nool SARS-COV-2 is found in all the characteristics of the viruses related to the physical core. Out of the human body, the virus is removed from the home cell soap, which carries its protective shell. SARS-COV-2 is the real connection to SARS-COV-2.
Its descendants are thought to be from hypnotic diseases.
The genetic analysis has been found to be relative to the family of the Ben Tacoronavares, the two of the Chemgader's roots in the French N.C.A., as well as B. Tacoronauers.
At the combined genome level, it corresponds to 96% similar to the other chimpanzees koronavaeravirus pattern (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that only one species of genome is found in some parts of the human and pygolian viruses.
To date, comparison to the complete genome has shown that most of 92% of the genetic material is associated with the Pygolian Coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is sufficient to prove that there is a wide host of penguol or viruses.
It can be found on the basis of the immediate symptoms of infection from viruses, although the affected halves are confirmed by IDT alone last night through the reverse transcranscorpption portals Chinese response (rRT-PR).
A study that compares the PRCT to the U.S. in Vienna reported that while TT is less specific but significantly more sensitive, its characteristics are similar to other patterns and diseases.
Also on March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiality suggests that T should not be used for screening as a test for analysis of COVID-19.
WHO has published a series of ARS-COV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
Test at the same time used the reverse translation portals Chinese response (rRT-PR).
This is done on a sample of the blood sample of the test breath.
The results are generally available from a few hours to days.
Usually this test is done by the anti-violet rice, although it can be used in the street as well. Many labs and companies are also in the original testing system, which reports NBD.
Even until April 6, 2020, none of them could have proved quite correct so that they could be used on a large scale.
In the United States, a surgical test by the U.S.A. has been approved to be used exclusively for the use of analytic laboratory.
In contrast with the radiograph and composted tomatoes (CT), which contain signs of this disease, as well as antimicrobial granaries and non-represented more nuances.
An international online database has been created by a photo of the Italian Radialo - Society authoritarian events.
Because of being overlapped with other infections such as Andrew Virus, the identification of COVID-19 without PCR's authentication is limited.
The CT results in a major study in China were compared to PCR, which showed that even though there is a low quality of brightness for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, it will be considered as a screening device.
Based on artificial intelligence networks were developed so that both of the viruses could be identified through radiography and tT.
The prevention of this disease involves a rapid self-regulated self-regulated maintenance, so that others are able to maintain their health, even if they are untreated, touch their nose, and chewing and chewing the tissue directly in a garbage dump.
Those who are already infected with this infection are advised that they go to public places to get public access.
There are also steps to prevent the disease from moving away from one another. Many countries have limited travel by restricted the safety of other countries to those areas that are affected by these diseases.
However, the virus has reached the edge of the community in a large part of the world.
It means that the virus is growing within the society and that people in the community don't know how and where they have been affected.
For this purpose, the threat of confidentiality has been launched by governments using the mobile phone to limit the type of surveillance.
Also, up to 7, 2020, various mobile app has applied it to volunteer use, more than one third are working on a secret friendly solution, such as using Bluetooth to get the place of the kitchen from another mobile phone.
Then comes a message used if he's been close to someone whose COVID-19 result has been positive, or the misconception about prevention; for example, putting water on a nose and throwing it into the mouth, it doesn't have the power to clean the rest.
There's no vaccine for COVID-19, but many agencies are working on one's preparation.
It is recommended to prevent the spread of illness.
It often tells people to look at the soap, especially after it's turned out to be; before it's washed; and when you clean a nose, bite, or bite.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is killed by the U.S.A. soap when its defense system is destroyed.
The device suggests the use of hand sensors based on more alcohol, with at least %60 alcohol in the amount of volume, when soap and water are not available.
The world’s health offers people to hear, to avoid touching the naked face without touching it.
Levels should also be purged in several ways (the level of stylish sta is retained for a minute in front of a germ), including %62-71 ambulance, %50-100 superparticles, %0.1 sodium encypolyticate, %0.5 hydrogen peroxide from 0.5 to %7.5.5
Other methods, such as the Benazalconium Clloride and the Khorex Gloconott are less effective.
The New Testament suggests that if there is a mediatic author or COVID case in a place, such as office or nursery, all the area, including the office, the hall, the media, the media, the media, the media, the electronic material such as the ticket, the Tch screen, the board, the Remote Control, the AT machine, those who use it, should be cleansed from the body.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their faces in tears and scrubbing their teeth and immediately tear them down.
The circuit map suggests that people who are affected, so that they both limit the distance between the bonfire and the distance to the expense of the person who is affected by the mask, when he does things, takes care and eats away.
The World Health Organization has launched programs such as when and how to prepare a vaccine.
According to the University of Leeds, Stephen Graffon, people may be less likely to bite their faces by masking, which is a major means of infection if they are to be treated without proper health care or the use of massages has been suggested for those who have been affected.
The World Health Organization has only recommended a smile for healthy people if their health is severely vulnerable, as they call people to a COVID-19 patient, even though they believe that people avoid touching their faces by masking them.
Many countries have started to urge the public to mask their faces.
According to custom, Chinese specifically suggested that healthy people from the public should use a cutting - especially when it comes to moving to others (1 meters (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong suggests that public transportation is used by means of transportation, or the circuit ministry while living in sheep - sit-in areas.

On March 16th, Jonathan asks everyone to have a face mask when he goes to public places so that he can protect himself and others.
The Australian government has ruled that everyone wants to be masked when entering a business facility.
Israel said to all the inhabitants of the land: “You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth. ”
Taiwan, which is producing ten million masks every day from Central March, I also need to mask passengers from April 1 to Sunday between railways and cities.
In Panama, face masks have been decreed to go out of the house, while in the home, there is also a way to prepare a mask for those who do not insist on buying them.
In Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore, there are also widely used face-to-face masks.
Social isolation (also called physical distance distance) includes the actions of disease control that aim to limit close contact between individuals and reduce the spread of infection.
These methods include trade restrictions, schools, workplaces, stadiums, urban shopping centers.
Individuals can point out ways of social isolation at home, avoid going to the gatherings, not receiving happy news, and physically away from each other.
Many of the governments that are affected by infectious diseases in areas, are promoting social isolation.
More than 250 people were quickly reduced to more than 250 people (which are not aware of the map COVID-19), which was later committed to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned more than two people's public gatherings, including older men and people who are ill, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and weak immune systems, and have suggested that they stay at home for more than a period of time because of the breakdown of social life in the community or on March 2020, the global health and other health institutions have begun to transform society into a state of isolation so that it has been maintained.
From the term social period, people began to feel that they should be completely separated from the world, rather than be motivated to interact with other people in alternative ways.
And among them are those who have no right to marry, except those who have an intimate relationship with their Lord, and have no signs of the kissing of a wheelchair.
The home creation itself is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are in doubt that they are affected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-regulated isolation, and many governments have suggested that the entire population live in an affected area be admitted to self-regulated Quanta.
The most severe measures of self-organism have been issued for those who are in serious danger groups.
Those who have recently traveled to a country or region where there is a wide variety of options, have been recommended for a 14 day self-efficacy with the recent COVID-19 patient.
In the process of controlling an arm, control, stress and shortness.
The wisdom of control is formed in the early stages of anti-terrorism, and the goal is to find the victims and separate them, to introduce other methods of infection control and vaccines to prevent disease from reaching other people.
When it is not possible to prevent the disease from growing further, efforts are made to reduce its risk: steps are taken to reduce its risk and reduce its effects on health care systems and society.
Preventive measures to reduce the effects, both jointly end at the same time.
To suppress the global epidemic, there must be more strict measures to bring back to less than 1 or less than the basic pollutants of the plague or a part of the treatment of a number of diseases is to try to reduce the flow of the virus, which calls for the removal of the virus.
It reduces the risk for health services, which are being defeated, and provides more time for oxygen preparation and treatment.
Unusual measures that regulate the spread of disease include measures such as health care, facial expression, and self-efficacy; social strategies that involve physical isolation, such as schools and social isolation; communities that encourage people to accept such movements and share them; such as these, to keep the environment clear and open-ended, to prevent them from being more strict, and to maintain strict travel, such as in a city, such as in a hard city.
Other countries concluded a number of different measures, which would be aimed at restricting the side of the virus.
South Korea built a large - scale screening and local anesthetics and continued on the move of the affected.
The silversmith made financial contributions to the affected people who sacrificed themselves and committed a heavy crime against those who did not.
The production of face masks and physical materials in Taiwan is increasing in wealth. The similarity of Britain and the United States to the United States shows that there is a decrease in the spread of disease (but not the end of it) and the stress (the lack of it) is a major challenge.
The more low-intensity policies allow the health demand rate to rise to 2/3 and half the death rate, but the first result is that hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems are being defeated.
Pressure may be preferred as a transfer, but it must continue until the virus moves to the human population (or, as long as a vaccine is available), others quickly return to health care when the steps are soft.
The long-term intervention to suppress global epidemics, social and economic expenditures.
The COVID-19 approved is not a special anti-viral therapy, but its efforts are ongoing, including experiences on current medicines.
The use of antiseptic colds, more water drinking and rest helps to end disease symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, oxygen, TV and breathing in the rug need to be helped.
The use of slid can make the results worse.
Many of the sites that have been approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also said that traditional and domestic breaks can bring relief to SARS-CoV-19's diseases.
COVID-19 has been described as a key step in answering the global health crisis in the ability and harmony of individuals to provide health care for the needs of patients.
The International and World Health Organization's National European Union Office has issued guidelines for changing problems on various stages for hospitals and primary health issues, focusing on the ability to test for Bashmol COVID-19, whenever possible, to prevent the right behaviour, to separate patients with COVID-19, to separate and remain single and receive third-time care through the training of staff.
There are many theories about where the first person (the patient) will begin.
The first case of the Körionavaires appeared on December 1, 2019, in the province of Hobby, China.
Inside one of the mice, the number of cascades in hobby began to grow slowly.
More of these events come from the Hal Hal Hale of the City, where live animals are sold, and one of the views is that this virus has come from such animals; in other words, it is the descendants of the virus animal cancers that were unknown.
On December 30, a group of doctors from the Central Vohoran Hospital wrote to their relatives about the course of Koronauvirus.
One of these doctors, Bassamol Leyenliag, was inspired by the police to fill out the life-in-laws, and the other, Yephan, his superiors, tried to secure themselves.
Later, the vice president of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights issued a public report on December 31, and reported global health.

After washing hands with a wash and hot driver, an average of 194% increase in bacteria on the neck of the Anglia and 254% on the helium.
As a result of drying out of the jetn fear, the bactia rate increased by 42% on the fingertips and 15% on the Haitians.
After washing their hands from the wash and tosshop, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips was reduced to the average %76 and %77 on the thheses.

To control the staphylococcal infection in hospitals, research showed that the best benefits of hand cleaning were first received from %20 million, and that when this rate was increased by %35, there was little additional benefit.
The use of simple soaps in the diet's immune system was three times more effective than anti-bitrical soap. The alcohol-based Mahalal and the anti-Bactivist apples learned to compare each of the 30 seconds of the arm's arm's blood pressure to be compared to that of the egg.
But to remove H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium dificial spores are more effective than a bottle of alcohol-based toilets.
Further studies in this conscience need to be made about how steps are more effective in various forms of health.
In developing countries, soap is considered to be a means of low cost, good health, and even better nutrition.
However, due to the lack of constant supply of water, soap, and wash facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces, the global wash habits of all people are a major challenge.
For example, in most parts of Africa, it is very difficult to have a hand to pull near a private or public toilet, even though there are very few expensive forms of washing places that are possible.
However, lack of soap and water can also lead to a strong habit.
Hand washing and thirsting decision makers can influence hands, warn about the benefits of washing, and create remote changes in the way the population operates.
It's important to be monitored and tested to make it effective.

Control the risk of working places for COVID-19
Controlling the risk of working places for COVID-19 is a practical form for professional safety and health measures to protect against the risk of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Depending on the location of the workplace where risks are at work and on the nature of work, the risk of performance resource analysis, the prevalence of disease in the community, and the workforce that can be unprotected for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. professional safety and health management (OHA), low-income jobs are those that have less professional communication with the public and other pioneers, for which basic steps are recommended to protect against infection, wash hands, if workers are sick, to support their home, to take breath, and to keep the environment clean and clean from germs.
There are jobs that are in contact with those who are unaware of being affected by COVID-19, but can be affected by social migration and international travel.
It includes workers who are contacted by the public, such as in schools, in the environment of the population, and in the majority of bird areas.
In addition to the basic safety measures to protect against infection for this grit, the high-intensity airfilter, guard against pockets, and if a COVID-19 victim encounters, there are personal safety resources, including personal safety measures.
In the case of OSHA COVID-19, the management of health care and the appearance of male house workers is considered to be a threat, much more displayable risk if the action of producing functional aerosol is known as the COVID-19 who collects examples from the terrorist.
These workers will have to make appropriate measures to control the risk, such as the lower pressure room of air travel and speed, and personal safety equipment that is in accordance with the nature of the task.
There are many effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 at the workplace.
In view of the risk of being sick, workers may be uneasiness due to fear of being protected, or injured.
Business methods can change, in terms of the interest of the materials and in terms of the acquisition of these items (at least in high periods of time, or delivery or fear of heroism)
In the end, Georgianly, COVID-19 can interfere with providing material from areas that are seriously affected, and can be used to prepare for a wide range of diseases and to eliminate them.
Plans highlight the level of risk related to the location of work and job activities, the risk factors that result from a well-being resource, home and community design, and the risk of individual workers, such as old age or chronic health conditions.
They also provide the root of emergency projects that are necessary to eliminate the risks, as the result of the outbreak of these control methods and epidemics.
The plans for a wide range of diseases and responses can be the subject of national or regional suggestions.
Reduced shifts between staff and staff in the purposes of reacting with a disease, protecting those who are at risk for poor health, and reducing the bad effects of business activities and supplies.
The community in which business is involved affects the response to the disease.
The framework of the level of control over the risks is professional safety and well-being, so that group risks can be effectively controlled.
Where the risks of COVID-19 are not eliminated, there are the most effective control control controls, followed by management controls, and finally personal safety equipment.
Plans include employees in control, without relying on their attitude, apart from the risk of working, and it can be the least expensive solution to the application.
The policy and procedures of the management control, which require the staff to act by the owner, is the change.
Personal protective equipment (PE) is considered less effective than engineering and management control, but some can help prevent exposure.
All types of PPE choices should be done on the basis of the risks, properly founded, if it applies (such as the taking of a Salens, the continuous and accurate method of living, the pain and change that is needed, if properly removed, clean and stored, or crushed to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. professional security and health management (OSHA), low-income risk jobs are in less professional contact with the public and other cars.
The basic steps to protect against infection for all places of work include frequent and thorough wash hands, encourage workers to stay at home if they are sick. If they are sick, stay at home, cover your breath, cover your face, cover your face and your throat, talk about the phone.
There is a caution to protect other people in places of recognition and separation, hours, visits, and work space.
The U.S. Department of Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have severe health problems stay at home until they stop using fever, fever, or other symptoms at least 24 hours of fever, or other symptoms, and that the patient's rehabilitation policies, which allow the patient to take care of the patient in the family, and this is known to the police.
According to OSHA, the risk of mid-Fasha is the jobs in which people who don't know how to be infected with COVID-19 require close contact from the distance between six feet [8 m] and six feet [1.8 m], but the current community near the business is affected by the SARS-COV-2, which is why the recent international trip has been marked by COVID-19.
It also includes workers who are in public, such as in schools, in rural areas, and in areas of employment or in many other areas. It includes setting up high-performance wire filters or speed speeds, building plastic gears for protection from six to six hours, and setting up windows, and setting up windows for high-sacred areas of security. It also serves as a way to support the needs of the home, to improve the quality of the home, to serve as well as a safe home, safe and safe destinations, and safe places for the HV, to help the people in the area.
In this group of risk workers, the device is useful.
If a man gets sick on a plane, the proper control for protecting staff and other passengers is to keep the sick man from getting away from others to 6 feet [6 to 6 feet], delay a patient for the patient, and present the sick person with a facial expression or say to the patient to cover his face with his face and face.
When a sick traveler comes back to the body’s routines or possibly the surfaces of the body, the ship’s function should be prescribed to despose cables and possibly extra personal safety equipment, if the sick traveler has difficulty taking a fever, persistence, or breathing.
Coaching and other discose apples would like to crack in the thaws for this purpose, and the oil levels should be cleaned and cleaned up later by cleanering the surfaces from the surfaces of the vessel for commercial or seamless ships, as well as the rest of the ship and other passenger ships, to control the danger that they may be transported, and to inform themselves immediately if there is any sign visible on the ship.
The above is that CDC recommends a delay for the death of high school and child care in cabins in the medical care system or if the affected person has come to the school building, even if he has not spread the virus, he will be cleansed from a clean germ.
As a little transfer of wireless to the middle degree, social-range intelligence practices can be applied, such as external activities, assemblies, and other major gatherings such as physical education or music classes, or the addition of food in the cafe tria, increase the distance between sessions, travel, and restrictions, to avoid unnecessary visits, and the use of health office for those who have the same conditions.
When there is enough movement in the local community, social distance intelligence can be observed as well as long as schools can be considered. The law enforcement practices that are performing their daily activities, according to CDC, are less likely to have immediate health risks.
The officers who file the law, who are convinced that they must communicate with those of COVID-19, are recommended that they follow the same leadership principles that are for emergency technicians, as well as proper personal safety equipment.
If there is close contact during the crisis, the workers should clean their thick belts and gear with clean, clean, and clean, before using house cleaning, before using house cleaning or before using them, and use a standard procedure for washing and washing.
According to OSHA, some health officials and women's workers are at the risk of more or more money.
Employees of high-income jobs, health care, support, Liberty, and medical transport workers who face COVID-19 are known to be affected by infectious patients.
They become very vulnerable when activists take on the role of the Esol making operations, that COVID-19 know that the sample models of the mercenaries are organized.
In the event of the Essol making, entering the Nile, examining the streets, some of the actions of dentists, and some of the unsatisfactory models.
Among the more expensive jobs in the palace, there are workers who prepare the male and female communities for the deaths that were known to be COVID-19; these risk groups include extra-reproportionated carols, such as Bishmol COVID-19, known as those who were separated for moderate patients, bashmovols, when they were used to make amules.
Some health officials and special low-speed delivery tools in the menarche areas can be appropriate.
Examples should be under the safety measures of left-handed level 3.
The World Health Organization recommends that those with incoming patients be separated for certain waiting hours, depending on whether they are in contact with COVID-19 cases other than PPE, OSHA recommends a device for those who have known patients or SARS-COV-2 at a distance of 6 feet from a patient or a member of SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform the service of the community.
In the United States, NIOSH's approval of a comprehensive and written safety program would be better used by NIOSH than that, including proper testing, training, and medical testing.
Other types of equipment can provide better protection and improve the resting of the staff. WHO does not recommend covering fully, since COVID-19 is a self-impression, not a body condition.
The WHO recommends only the circuit unit in the area of the screen for the implementation.
Those who are trying to collect self-regulated models, the COVID-19 patients are taking care of non-Esolutive methods or moving them, WHO recommends for them the service masks, units, or faces.
If the service maker's method is paid, it's the location of the service machine that takes you to the N95 or FFP2 device.
Knowing that PPE's global relief is non-existent, such as WHO Telemedian, medical stops, only allow them to enter the room directly, using PPE for specific work, without taking care of one or more patients who suffer from one disease, including PPE's health care, maintenance and maintenance, and the use of non-smokers.

We're under extraordinary circumstances this month.
The global epidemic of COVID-19 is the one that has made it clear that man is internationally connected and that we have the responsibility of each other.
We don't have a first example of this kind of challenge, but we know well that our best answer is that the world is feeling, cooperation, and community building that the spirit of the organization is going on.
The feelings of friendship and attention that we all have seen in all of our cars emails, phone calls and chats, all of this is evidence of how lucky we are to work with amazing people.
I can't be more grateful and proud that you're all my workers.
Last week, someone praised me for our work.
They reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world that they are now turning to the Wikipadia, and how strong a sign is for all of them.
Your work has made it possible, even if you're with the sites, that our cars are the agencies that protect our community.
The world needs information and Wikipadia provides it, now more than ever.
It's the moment in which not only do what we do, but how we do it, it'll reflect positive effects on the world.
In view of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we'll make some significant changes from this week to how we work together.
Changes in Our Work and Schedule
As Robin first expressed, our point of view for the coming days and months was met by the night of C-Team to talk on the schedule.
In this conversation, we considered what would be the most appropriate response to what we had to face and how to keep Argnasion on our feet at this time.
For a long time, we wanted to end the stress and increase our mission.
If you want to do so, you need to do the right thing.
All staff members and staff members:
The expectations for our daily work will be about 4 hours of fee, or 20 hours per week, to order, and then to do so.
We're not declaring the sixth -- if you can do things according to normal hours, the mission can use you.
However, nothing can be said about the world at this time, and even if you need to take care of your loved ones, you have to buy a deal, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It doesn't have to say, but we're saying that.
Not only requires PTO of the disease - just tell your killer and help your team's calendar and schedule to make a new head-up, it's all the aspects of making sure that this is done.
(If you get positive reviews for COVID-19, inform Brian inside T&C Ops, then T&C can help with support and make sure your situation is well cared).
Friends who work on hours of hours will be paid out.
We were told this before, and We were going to send things to our people and the people of the city to whoever wills, and the exact number of hours.
Each member will be paid for his or her hours in normal circumstances.
It includes if you're sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll help you.
Many people work around the world to change their mind.
What we can do is undeniably dangerous, in such days.
Again, it's all for your personal safety.
We're just so much so that you're talking to your major, so that we'll figure out what you're expecting and then fix things according to that.
Any work is considered necessary.
There are things that we need to keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (except for others) work hard, which may require additional support.
Let's examine the current goals with all fields and let's change our attention to what is necessary for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we'll all focus on the most important projects.
At that time, we are not suffering from the effects of slowness.
We are not planning to do this once the world has passed away.
You're not expected to work extra time to meet the Head Lines, which is real right now.
We admit that the circumstances have changed, and where appropriate, we'll work for the new half and the team line.
What did PP build up?
To arrange our new reality and day-to-day expectations, we plan our 2020-2021 year plan.
We want to expand our 2019-2020 projects that take more time to create a budget where workers will be allowed to change the priorities of their work, and those of their loved ones will be able to do in such a situation that they will be able to implement those needs that are less likely to work for a while.
In this vastly expanded organization of time, current planning and pressures are at a high price.
We'll introduce the board to our plan the next week, and we'll get the confirmation of what you're doing and warn the team about the next step.
Thank you for leading the AP team in it.
Office status, appearance and cleaning.
Twenty-five weeks, we have heard that our best friend in an SF could be affected by COVID-19.
Despite much caution, however, we applied for an e - virus operation at the San Francisco office so that we could clean up all the surfaces.
They used a hospital degree of antiseptic slums to clean up every level of soil and lakes, which allows us to reach the reach.
This building is using its own prototypes, which maintain the safety of its crews.
We feel comfortable that the office will be in perfect condition that we decide to return.
Our office is in the office, which has shared our COVID-19 protocol with members of the whole office.
For the past five weeks, our Bethel office went to a remote location, according to San Francisco's mutual guidelines.
As we know what's going on in our country, we're also doing a lane in Brooklyn.
This conversation continues, but it will be delayed.
Our best friends are working from far for the first time.
We know our old time is that it can be a very good editor and you want some advice.
Meeting attendance is over one or two hours long.
If there is a need for long elections, consider how they will be divided on a number of days.
Let's explain the meeting as each of the agendas, and send the moving material first.
Create a video tablet, including Google Docs and Zom for direct cooperation and communication.
Let's get a high level of support for each meeting, one who wants to take care of the discussion for the questions and arranges the schedules and helps someone get a note (or close a note with each other).
If you have a comfortable headset, send technical support.
Use the money for the kanks.
To talk about the dividends from your colleagues, I'm involved in the #Remates Channel in Cyrillic.
An ironomics, based on the HIV - positive team, is taking into consideration the guidelines provided by the International Federation for the Worldwide Organization.
Twenty-five weeks we have said to all the citizens of society that they will reject the favourable public festivals of Wikimedia, such as Eddehadhantins, until global health of global health announces the end of this global epidemic.
They should realize that it is possible for us to meet the demands and restrictions that have been accepted and that there will be no crime in this regard to reforming or slowing down.
In the coming week, we will take further guidance on the Kenyan and other regional and cultural conferences.
The general feelings of the global community are common in this area, but the ability to focus on their own brothers and sisters, the media.
Moving forward, Or TT is working on creating a web page on Metaki so that the community can provide support for their content and monitor their effects.
Stay in touch with issues related to COVID-19.
We'll also invite your classer to join us for a special meeting at Next Chapter 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We'll use this time to share the latest information, answer your questions, and spend time connecting one another.
We're just the same and we're going to help each other as much as possible.
In this case, you can continue to get information about COVID-19 on this machine and other vital information related to office.
This page will close all the latest and all the other information on a single site.
We're working on maintaining a regular relationship by these members of the staff who are currently living in countries that are quite affected.
If you have a trip, a festival, an important task, or a course challenge or something that you need to help, please don't hesitate to work and get information as RT does.
We are here to provide cooperation and communication at the right time.
If you have a secret case, please use Brern Jordan, Director.
None of these changes need to be made as we carry out our tasks and responsibilities.
But they're an acquaintance on this occasion, our work and responsibilities will need to be covered in a way that we've never seen in the past.
These are the steps that we promise to help each other to continue working, to support our motivation that is needed and to serve the world on which they rely.
When the time comes, we will be waiting for things to happen.
Now, helping each other requires time and take care of important work that will come in a few weeks but will probably come in a few months.
To do this, we all need you, and that's why you all need to take care of yourself and your family so that you're ready when needed.
Now, please, open your hands and don't touch your face!
Kevin, J. R.T. (American, A.M., Brian J.D., Gregory, J.J.M., J.M., Lentman, R.M., & Tony S.), and the rest of the team's leadership (Gent I, Homeer WW), J.M., J.J., L. S., L. S., R., R.A., R., R.M., & Toube.).
B. Antitonin - enzyme 2 is an enzyme that corresponds to the outer surface of the cells in the puppys, veins, hearts, surroundings and intestines.
The ACE2-related antigens that alter the enzyme's concentration by reducing the amount of insulin intension II and combating the amount of ang (1-7), make it a reliable factor in treating the disease. The ACE2 also serves as an entry point for the cells of coronary disease.
The human version of the enzyme is often called HACE2.
There is a form of anesthesis that transforms the enzyme 2 which includes the metalanism that is found at the end of the Earth's atmosphere and the rest of the cells.
The ACE2 protein includes the E-Trill Epipeptidas M2 DD and a CT-Ctrel Collateral Reel Ew Advanced Transparator Domain.
ACE2 has a single single membrane protein of Type I, with a thin layer of cells in the lungs and other fibers.
Outside of the cells of ACE2, the DORE is transferred to the trans-Merbern Dome Cellwood, which is called the Schhadsis, and the result is that the solution proteins are left in the bloodstream which eventually emerges through the front.
ACE2 is most found in the body: ACE2 is primarily linked to the digestive tractic cells of the digestive tract II, small organ interactions, arterial and heroinase and arterial membrane cells.
The ACE2 M.A. is affected by the external body of the brain, the body, the lower limb, and the lower limb, and the brain chain.
The main task of ACE2 is to work as a contrast balance of ACE.
The AK enzyme I ammone is responsible for injection II's blood clotting veins.
In exchange, the ACE2 carbonyl trised phenaella is separated from the intestine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe), and is able to distinguish the hydrogens from the vesodilator antigen (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-H).
ACE2 also separates several other peptides, including [Dice-Arg 9] -Bredicine, Alan, Erotin, Hanorfan A, and the home.
ACE2 also controls the movement of SLC6A19 that leads to natural self-acid and is associated with mental illness.
As protein transfer, ACE2 serves as a central organ in the cells of a few coronary arteries, Bishmol HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (which is caused by SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, on the level of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the inhibitor of the enzyme domain of the ACE2 is to be able to penetrate the cell's content and move between both viruses and enzymes.
In this process, the serine proteins represented by TMPRSS2 also need the priority of aspirin, which is passed on as an antidepressant treatment under existing studies. Some have concluded that it might be easier to cope with the lack of ACE2 in cells, such as the disease.
However, a number of professional communities and organizations have suggested that non-commercial NGOs and ARB nationals not continue.
A management review and meta analysis published on July 11, 2012, revealed that the use of DNA in the 334 reductions in sample risk compared with the single single - parent population.
Further, the risk of pneumonia among those infected with ANOP sufferers, especially those who are infected with pneumonia, is low.
EL al-Badras also avoids a shortage in the deaths related to pneumonia, although the consequences were less than the total risk of pneumonia.
Human pendery ACE2 (rhACE2) is surrounded as a modern cure for the severe injury of snakes, and it is likely that it will improve the supply of homodynamics and oxygen with the symptoms of a lipolysaccharide.
Half of the rhACE2 life in humans is about 10 hours and 24 hours of activity begins in 30 minutes.
Many of the results show that RhACE2 is a better cure for people suffering from asthma in the Kilisian Reyn-Antokines System (RAS), which has increased the risk of an intensities of anesthesien II. The rise of rhACE2 ammish during severe breathing experiences is known.
B'COVID-19 Apps are mobile applications that help communicate during the World Wide Web of Coronaries, 2019-20, for example, the process of identifying people who have been in contact with an affected person.
With the cooperation of the government, there were numerous applications in several areas and circuits that were suggested.
A number of applications have been developed to find contact.
The secrets of confidentiality have been revealed, especially about the system that uses the app to find the geographic location.
An alternative to low blood pressure involves the use of Bluetooth signals so that the user can transport them to another mobile phone.
Google and Apple announced on April 10, 2020, that they would assist these kind of Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has created an app that allows citizens to know if they were in contact with a COVID-19 affected person.
This is used in more than 200 cities of China, using the Tris Togidder app in Singapore.
This app was created by a local IT community saying that, which was issued as a free source and will be referred to as the government. The NorthM has launched a Bluetooth-based app called the University of Corona, which provides information about the proximity of potential victims and provides a quick response to health-development officials.
It has been developed by app-powering reports and technology and energy health.
Also until April 14th, 2020, the app is waiting for Google Yellow Star and Apple Apple Store's approval.
The government told 12 April that the search for the Internet was in the next stage and that within a week, the award will be available.
Australia and New Zealand both look to prepare applications based on the Tres Togider app and the Bolturis protocol, which is designed to introduce the Joftysing app for patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 in Russia, to make sure that people don't leave their homes.
Professor Ross Anderson of the University of Cambridge University, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, based on the app, has found that there is a wide range of potential risk factors in hospitals based on antisocial consequences and low percentages, if the use of the app was limited to a small percentage of the population.
Misconceptions about the spread of anti-corranialism or the spread of the app, Apple has determined the limits of what kind of organizations are able to include applications related to coronaviers in their app store, restricting them only to well-being organizations in other forms.
Google and Amazon have similarly banned.
Scholars of the Secrets have expressed their fears about the numerous restrictions of surveillance on the Koronauliers app, especially on how surveillance arrangements will be removed even after the end of the threat.
Human rights international and more than 100 other organizations have launched a statement that has been called to restrict the management of this type of surveillance.
These agencies have announced the status on government projects:
Watching should be important and inappropriate;
Let's have an extended period of time in surveillance and practice:
The use of data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
The protection of data will be protected from revealing the name and showing security on the basis of the evidence.
Digital surveillance must avoid being over-stressed and unnecessary;
Some third parties have to make the data clear under the Public Law;
There will be security measures against the violations, and citizens will have rights to respond to the violations;
All major contributors will need meaningful participation, experts from the Bushol Public Hall and non-profit group, German House Computer Club (CCC) and without Borders (PRSF) also issued a list of surveillance lists.
Google/Apple's project is from its operating system's device, when it doesn't need it, monitors the car and aims to solve the permanent surveillance problem.
Instead of an app, many countries used network-based network-based site surveillance system, which would eliminate both the need to download the application and the ability to monitor it.
In Israel, the network-based surveillance system was approved.
The network-based solution, which provides access to the site's location, is the key issue of privacy.
In any case, all of the major servers do not need access to the data of the private site; a number of secret security systems are made that use only key servers for newscasting one another.
In South Korea, a non-application system was used to address the issue.
Instead of using one of the best applications, the system collected surveillance information from different sources to show data from data and cards on the baseball mobile device, and collects them all and prepares notes through text messages for potential victims.
In addition to using this information, the government has publicly provided information on the site, which has been given since recent changes in the privacy laws of information have been made in this country.
This information is available to the public through numerous applications and websites.
By April 6, 2020, its details were not issued.
There is a better idea of communication that protects privacy, which has a lot of history of research content up to at least 2013. By April 7, 2020, over a dozen experts were using confidentiality as a friend or Hal, such as Bluetooth's ability to monitor the user's occasion to access another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a major effort that consists of both central and non-mercial methods, and it is not a single protocol. In the U.S. protocol: surveillance of non-universal secretion security facility (DP-PPT / DP-3T), the temporary number of communication numbers (TCN,fka event contact number, CEN), the sense privacy protocol and the way to communicate with mobile devices (PAT) and others.
The identity of these protocols does not go away from the personal data device and all the reconciliations are on the device.
The MIT Media Libertarian Group is creating a safe route, which is a platform designed to collect and use the security technology of spying while using the COVID-19 spreading data.
It's based on the study of the personal private state in the Orthodox People's Gon Rogue, which was released in March 2020. Another similar attempt was by Engma AmP, a HF-T-Tres plate firm, a company designed for confidentiality, which was originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
Frays use protective hardware technologies to allow users to share their location and health with other users and participants without any consideration of the information.
On April 5th, 2020, the world-wide unity was founded by a group that gathered for the same purpose as the point of view and which were large-scale fundamentals, or reduced to specialization so that surveillance and anti-terrorisms could be activated worldwide, which is an important aspect of the principle of self-efficacy on a large scale.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that the application used by their government, the Bulgarians application, was free.
On April 10, 2020, companies that control the Android and IOS mobile platforms, Google and Apple, announced a plan to issue the contact, which they claim will protect, according to the combination of weak bottle or technology and security secrets.
They also published information about the actual technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be executed in three months:
The results of these protocols will be able to provide a secure reward for the official security of the search for coronaviers.
Google and Apple are determined to solve the problems of this permanent monitoring problem by directly in the iOS and indedicative of this activity, that the first system is divided by the latest activities of operating systems, and then it will be removed in the same way when the danger passes.

B'Koronavavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a chronic disease caused by severe heart disease Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Common signs include fever, cough, and breathing.
Other symptoms include te cutot, pain in joints, hypertension in the throat, breathing in the throat, dehydration, and pain in the stomach.
It usually takes five days from the beginning of the symptoms but can last from two to four days.
Although the symptoms of illness are common in many cases, the very viral patterns and the failure of the body.
Also up to 17 April 2020, there have been reports of more than 2.24 million events from 210 continents and territories, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 5680,000 people have become depressed.
Even when the breaths get out of the air, they often fall on the ground, and they can get sick from a long distance.
People may also suffer from this condition by chewing their skin, chewing the nose, or chewing the nose after chewing the affected surface.
This virus can survive for 72 hours on the surface.
Within three days before the beginning of the symptoms, it is the most common disease, although it is possible to spread in the area before and after symptoms have been diagnosed and after illness. It is the standard method of testing in creation.
The use of masks is addressed to those who are suspected of being infected with viruses and who are well-informed.
For the common people, there is a disagreement with the idea of masking, the parties are against the use of it, the ones suggesting the use of it, and the people are making it necessary.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19 at the time.
The local delivery of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the world’s major health.
People affected by viruses may not have symptoms that come up with signs such as fevers, coughs, caustics, and pain in breathing.
The pain in breathing in the sign, the constant stress in the skin, the stress of mind, the pain in wake, and the loss of facial lips; if these symptoms exist, it is recommended to take immediate medical assistance.
The symptoms of disease on the body of the person, the nose's sister, or the throat, can be seen as well.
Symptoms, cassias, and swasals were discussed in a number of percent.
Early in China, some of the events were hard to deal with, and some were even more difficult to deal with.
In many cases, the disease is diagnosed, more body failure and suffering on the way to death.
It's called an incubation cycle.
Incubation for COVID-19 is generally between five and six days, but it can be between two and 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms of disease will do this within 11.5 days.
Without the symptoms, these victims are not fully aware; but the earliest evidence shows that these diseases can be prevented.
Those affected by this disease are now unaware of the symptoms and are being studied, where the control and prevention of Korea's diseases and the cancers of the Arthritis (KCDC) have reported that there are %20 of all cases confirmed during hospital stays.
China’s National Health Commission began to count the incidents of AIDS in its daily affairs on April 1, with about 130 (%78) of 166 victims that day.

Some medical techniques such as the Implication and Cardio Pulmonary Reduction (CPR) can espionage the individual's desires and lead to the spread of it.
Now, when there are concerns that it spreads from water, it is considered less dangerous. When signs appear in people, the virus is the highest number; and if it is possible to spread viruses before the signs are seen, the risk is less.
The European Center of Prevention and Control says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually affects two or three people from the virus Hour to day.
In particular, one day on the virus knee, plastic (poli propulin) and unsangued steel for three days, and 99% were found to be useful for four hours on the tube.
However, it continues to change the quality of normal and temperature.
If soap and hydrogen are used properly, they are effective; soap’s products make the virus's delicate protective system ineffective, along with cleaning the virus quickly and from other surfaces.

The symptoms of severe breathing pain are coronary heart disease Cournavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), first found among three people in Vienna, with severe respiratory diseases.
Nool SARS-COV-2 all the features of the virus are located in the coronaures related to nature.
Out of the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which gives it protection. SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to the original SARS-CoV-COV.
The first are the organs that are most affected by COVID-19 because the virus inhibits the change of the intestine 2 (ACE2) to the host cells, which are most commonly found in the various II types of cells.
A special level of gratitude for the virus to bind to ACE2 is called the helicopter, uses, and enters the host cell.
12% of the victims who entered the hospital in Vienna, China, found a heart attack and found a lot of severe illness.
The risk of heart attack is higher during the death and disease that occurs in the whole body, but the risk of severe heart disease is also associated with ACE2 immune cells.
2ACE is more visible in the heart and they are involved in the action of the heart.
In patients with COVID-19, there were more than 31% of blood clotting in steroids (25%) and tarombulbolism (25%) and they could be associated with bad assessment. COVID-19 showed the loss of the post martage in the stomach and the mass of the susssi diocation.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a side effect for the appearance of the serum cells of the ACE2 breath, COVID-19 has more respiratory symptoms than the regulars that affect the body.
In particular, T-cell T-celling T-cells, which are sick, were seen in cases of COVID-19, have been diagnosed with HIV-6, and have been diagnosed with acute hypertension.
There are also reports of the intervention of lymphic cells during post-martum.
WHO published several ways of testing the disease.
The standard way of experimenting is at the time of reversing crime crime.
The test is usually performed on examples of the nervous nervous system that is derived from the creative infinity of the rhyme; however, the nose can also be used as a sample of the oil.
The results are usually available in two days from just a few hours.
Blood tests can be used, but it needs to take two samples in two weeks and the immediate significance of the results is reduced.
Chinese scientists succeeded in separating one type of coronava virus and published the genetic order so that the whole world’s libatories were able to produce a response to the police in order to find out the number of diseases that would occur freely from the virus.

As the disease spreads, the entire power can be displayed, the Krisi Pong (the mother-in-law of the Goshka obsolescence) and the stability.
There are some statistics about COVID-19 famines and biophysiology.
The most important desired results on post-Martam are:
McRescoh: The puppy tree’s sousveillance, the smoothness of the heart, the stability of the stairs, and the structure of the puppys.
Waterl can see four types of salts:
Light samples: puppys are made with a wide range of eye suffocation, a high-smosite, a large unsatisfactory hygienic membranes, the formation of hygienic susceptibility and agility of hygienic cervical fluids.
TEENAGERS: A low intake of chewing gum (DAD) low in fat.
\"O fear of a severe respiratory disorder\" and a severe lack of oxygen in the body.
To be a monopolia: Absorbing the Absorbation in El Salvador and the Pommonary Bivala
