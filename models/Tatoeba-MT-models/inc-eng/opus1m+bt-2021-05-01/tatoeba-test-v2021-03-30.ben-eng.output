Stop shouting.
He doesn't end up doing anything.

Why are you shouting?
I love to write a song in French.

Nice to see you again.

I know we still love each other.
Forgive me, I've been waiting for you.
What have you got?
Sit here.
It's too sick in the hospital.
He's asking what it can do.
I asked them to send another ticket.
I can't believe it!
Tom will talk.
He explained the literal meaning of the sentence.
This is yours.
Read it first.

Wait outside.
Can you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I don't deny it.
The puzzle is funny.

How can they forget us?
I understand your condition.
I'm not Tom.
What a joke!
My book is here.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not too busy right now.
Monday, where are you going?
They screamed.
Tom Jackson wrote three books.
Tom told me that today.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm just kidding.
I'm not proud of that.
Let's run.
The train came as it was in time, so we didn't have to wait.
I'm not your friend.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Come with me.
Is that your new friend?
You can write in any language. All languages in Tatoeba are alike.

Take Tom to the hospital.
Hold my hand.
How can they forget us?
Because you don't want to be alone.
Will you go shopping with me?
How old are you?
Don't go to the kitchen.
Call me tomorrow.
Sit wherever you want.

We're Arab.
Tom's hurt.
Where are you?
Smile.
I lost your phone number.
Everyone is here.
Would you like to eat something?

Time's up.
Try more.
Have you ever eaten a curd fish?
He was giving a speech.
I like him.
You're so long!
I did my job.
I want my moon.
I was a cash.
I don't like my body.
Wherever he went, his dog followed him.
You're not a doctor?
I saw him running.
Tom is a boy's name and Mary's name is a girl.
Tom's in trouble, right?
What's your name?
Let's get out of here.
What's that price?
Do as he says.
I think the train is late.

Is this seat empty?
We've won.
My brother is two years older than me.
Stop!
The hotel was created last year.
Eat everything.
I want my gear.
Stop that woman.
What will you do this time tomorrow?
Don't talk.
You can write in any language that is the same as all languages in Tatoeba.
They're there.
It's his home.
Forty million people say English as their first language.
This house is my squirrel.
Where can I buy the envelope?

Are you cold or cold?
Eat what you want.
Don't call me.
Is that far from here?
Where's the boy?

Do you want to learn French?
Do you understand what I mean?
No one understands me.
Go away.
Newe is a country.
He's sleeping like kids.
Can you show me your boarding pass?
Can you please help me?

I'll do it.
Do you have time?
I thought you would come.
Tom is very cute.
I'm busy.
You can go home this time.
He's younger than me.
I think Tom's fine.
I'll go back to Australia two days.
Tom told Mary that she was going to kill herself, but she didn't have the courage to do it.
Can you catch fish with us?
Although it's not bad by itself, in many cases, many see too much television.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm cold.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I still can't believe I trusted Tom.
Careful.
My son can't count yet.
Look at the car.
I'll eat.
I don't want to go shopping alone.
How far is the station from here?
She was sick at the end of the week.
Tom hit the door repeatedly, but no one came out.
He's a doctor.
Stop dragging.
I'm hurt.
Go to the hospital.
The ambassador is back.
Please go ahead with the nine.
The pan is broken.
Tom always keeps his word.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I refuse.
Wait outside.
I need a taxi now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
This happened at least three times.
Tom wants me to go with him.
We try once!
Tom is tired.
Don't forget our word.
Tom kept talking.
I'm in the north.
It's so tired of seeing you.
Tom kept me waiting all afternoon.
He's eating.
He was sick at the end of the week.
I'll see you next month.
We need to contact Tom's parents.
Where can I buy that paper?
I'll be back in seven.
Is the heart too deep?
I was late.
Call Tom.
What's the price?
Tom saw him.
When's your plane?
Tom is long, but not as long as I am.
He's my wife.
I'm not very good at swimming.
Where's the tourist office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
He didn't tell me his name.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Are you here?
What happened?
$250 with home rental tax.
I'm not very good at French.
My father is going to China.
Can he speak French?
I want it.
I'm your friend, right?
Help me!
I'll help you.
I don't agree with him.
Call the police!
I was worried.
There's a cup on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get out of this ship.
It's Tom.
He hasn't come yet.
Kim laughed sweetly.
I don't live in town.
Women change the world.
Let's get a little faster.
I don't want Tom to see me this way.
Tom started screaming.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
It's worth $40.
Start here.
We're waiting for them.
My yellow choice.
Tom decides to keep a diary.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you shouting?
Can I get a little check?
Do you have anything bigger than that?
Tom gets twice from me.
I need it.
I think you don't need my help.
Tom waited outside the gate.
Don't wait.
Is the museum open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Shall we eat out today?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom's hit.
He's Kashan.
Are my laundry cups ready?
Where can I buy it?
I need to send a fax.
He's eating too much.
He taught me to write.
Call my welcome.
I could play that song.
I was surprised.
Where's Boston?
We're Dorics.
The rules are simple.
Can you keep an eye on the Tom?
You're better than me.
He's not here yet.
I can't pull my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom took the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Do you understand me?
Tom was surprised when he heard that Mary Aray John was married.
In most cases, it depends on effort.
Tom was laughing.
Tom broke his head.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows it now.
I got my shoes.
I was surprised.
Do you live in a world where there is a lot of suffering and injustice?
What's the scar on the blade?
The contact's disconnected.
Can I get a spoon?
Have you ever broken your bone?
I'd like to put on the next stop.
How are you?
I'll go to the dentist tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
Right?
He's not here yet.
They're doctors.
Do you understand what I mean?
You ever ride a horse?
He was talking.
I have two brothers.
What about you?
I had nothing to say to Tom.
Try more.
Tom walked.
Why are you sitting there?
What language is spoken in the United States?
I'm tired.
He has two daughters.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I'm your friend.
Follow Tom.
Tom always keeps his word.
He's an expert teacher.
I think you both know Tom.
Tom's here.
Everyone wants happiness.
I forgot your phone number.
Tom lost.
You're tired, aren't you?
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
Go on.
Everyone saw it.
How much time does the bus leave?
Since Tom spoke French, I didn't understand anything about him.
I want this guitar.
This is a doctor.
What's your father's name?
I want to know who started.
Don't go to the kitchen.
Don't move!

Language is a means of communication.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard of Tom anyway.
The next train leaves for Tokyo?
Tom's risking a big deal.
Are these yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Will you go to America next month?
I don't want to go swimming.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you so much.
He hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
I want to tell you so much.
The snow reflects the hump.
Come out.
They screamed.
I ran home.
We made pancakes for the raft.
Don't you have a bicycle?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're screaming.
He's Kashlen.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everyone saw it.
I'll feed my cat in the morning and in the morning.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be present.
Do you have your passport?
Please excuse my speech.
Do as he says.
It's so tired of seeing you.
Tom started screaming.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
Muriel's birthday today is June 15 and today.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We have to ask Tom to do this for us, right?
Can these cups be taken for granted?
I'm going to Oska Station.
I don't think Tom's responsible for this.
Someone's a kashlo.
I went to the bakery.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Take a look.
Tom was busy with work.
I'm not proud of the way I used.
I screamed.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm screaming.
My arm is not working properly.
Forget Tom.
How dare you!
Is it Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
We have to go.
He ignores education.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's just making his head warm.
Wherever he goes, his dog follows him.
Who's this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
It's my business to collect old bottles.
I like the paint.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Do you have a bicycle?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play nice golf.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here right now.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come on!
Stop dragging.
Was Tom there?
I've been bleeding this afternoon.
My back is still hurting.
Where's Tom gone?
They look like Americans.
You were the only friend of Tom.
I was in the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive a good car.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his position was Jackson.
You know Tom for too long than me.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My wallet hasn't reached yet.
Tom's not here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom is very much talking to him.
Eat something.
Is there anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's fine.
Where will I get the stamp?
I'm going to scream.
Can he speak French?
Tom could have done that.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
Will you take some more?
And one day.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that Church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where will I demand my wallet?
We do what we want.
Tom's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for students whose native language is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be the minister.
Whom would you trust?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserve.
No one is indispensable.
Are you here?
The rest of them are laughing.
How many nights will you be?
Have you seen the man in this picture?
I've lost my wallet.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want Tom to wake up.
My son is studying the economy.
The sky looks like it's going to start ice tonight.
How much does it cost?
You know exactly what Tom wants.
We dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I just want Tom to be happy.
Those who are in the mud should not have stone scraped.
Why are you screaming?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his umbrella back.
Is Tom at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'll kill you.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided by a river east and west.
Let's see if you can.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tom's playing the guitar.
Do you have a plan to do something now?
He's already lunching.
Can you keep an eye on the Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth hurts.
How much do these potatoes do?
How much do you have to pay for extra?
Everyone loved Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you Japanese?
Let's get a little faster.
Eat what you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken your bone?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't swim my right leg.
I'm dry.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What is that?
Here's your key.
We've seen something worse.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What is that?
He's eating.
The rabbits like the gorillas.
You didn't understand.
I'm hurt by Mary.
Sit at the table.
He's younger than me.
What's your name?
We're waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use credit cards?
It's too big, isn't it?
This book can only be found in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I pay for credit cards?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson.
He wore a black hat.
Anything else?
Everyone screamed.
Is there any left for students?
I'll eat noodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask what they think, ask what they do.
Will you come in?
I'll tell you.
We like football.
What are you gonna eat?
Good evening.
He's just eating fruit.
I want new shoes for these shoes.
Everyone loved Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Enjoy it.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'm going to swim, but I'm raining tomorrow.
My right shoulder is hurting me.
My father was busy.
Everyone's ready to go.
I couldn't hold the train at 2:00.
He had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
Do you have a pen?
Class doesn't start before eight hundred.
You're gonna spend a couple of hours in the way?
What does that word mean?
How much can I get?
Can you say English?
What they did is wrong.
My son is taller than me.
Tom's parents were singer too.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
He's looking at Fakas.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let go.
I have a little fever.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Fill in.
How old are you?
Grab Tom.
They're squirreling.
You're screaming.
I don't think tomorrow will rain.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I love astrology.
He's grown in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Ten hundred people were killed.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Tom's a pigker.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
Now is a time.
I never make a mistake.
Where's the opening door at UA11?
I fucked up.
Why are you screaming?
Tom wants his umbrella back.
How many times do you usually go to bed?
The country signed a deal between them.
I speak French with Tom in empty.
Tom got eyes.
Can you give me a gift?
Tom's in the garage now.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's laughing.
He hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who came?
He's bearing fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
Terrorists left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my wallet.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has broken down the income.
Leave the city!
Gunnun till Tirish.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
That's Japanese.
Did you see him leaving?
How much does the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
Don't argue.
It's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got my test.
We were walking on foot.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom screamed.
Tom laughs very little.
Eat what you want.
Tom cries.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
The plane's reached the right time.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the audience were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I'm so hungry.
Tom won a lot of race.
He knows where we are.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom's dust.
Everyone was shouting.
I'll stay out.
My mother can cook well.
They're crying.
The research was successful.
I think Tom's got the gold he's got will be left with that little chance.
Boston is a big city.
Me too.
Here's your key.
Stop Tom.
Eat your milk.
We both have Tom's name.
They were all happy.
Is that your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the vase?
Tom's hit.
Go back to the back of the tom.
Is Tom still mad at me?
Tom's gone.
We're waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen to me.
We made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look there.
If you want to do something for me, you'll tell me.
We tried.
Tom resigned in October.
The market is next to the doctor.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this mark mean?
Tom broke his head.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blue Annas.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen to me.
Would you go shopping with me?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'll bite.
Everyone's perfect.
Don't hurt me.
Who was it?
I'm shy.
When I said that Mary left the city and was really surprised to see Tom.
I heard the scream.
When's your plane?
You don't want to talk about this.
My book seemed attractive.
Tell me what happened.
I've been in the middle of today.
Please light it up.
Tom's hurt.
I'm still your friend.
Some pages took me more than two hours to translate English.
Are those yours?
Who is he?
Is that the shortest way to get to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Did you know him?
It's impossible!
How much time does the train reach Yokohama?
What time is it?
The words that don't correct the correct ones can be replaced by more natural translations.
Your shoes are here.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Listen, is this train going to Washington Square?
We have failed.
There's AC in this house.
Did you wear it?
Tom Boston was on.
Clean it up.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
The evening may snow.
I'm not proud of him.
Is there anyone there?
It's all wrong.
I'm no longer young.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Would you go fishing with us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
Just a minute.
Tom was hurt.
Mary explained.
I don't deny it.
Don't see!
Complete it as soon as possible.
Use it.
How much time does the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand that either.
I've been seven o'clock this morning.
I'm at home.
Take it easy.
Happy Christmas!
I went in.
Me, too.
I'm not too busy.
It's wonderful.
Do it again!
Tom started at Kashah.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
I don't want to go because I don't want to go.
I know it.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My leg is hurting.
Ask Tom.
I wonder what I'm gonna give you a birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you screaming?
Stay right there.
Eat the food you like.
We used to play the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets?
I've finished my job.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy about it.
Don't get in.
We're lost.
Tom is screaming.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm just looking, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We're waiting for them.
How old do I seem to be?
Tom's not happy here.
He was angry.
I don't like coffee.
Be quick to talk.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here's your brain.
We don't care what he does.
I called my good friend Tom.
We can't play better than this.
We're shy.
The bill will be deleted today.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Eat what you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
