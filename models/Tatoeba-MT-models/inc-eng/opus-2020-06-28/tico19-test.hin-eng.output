The rapid growth of Korean disease (COVID–19), rising from January 1 to 15, 2020, in the European Union / the United States and in the United Kingdom.
The former widespread spread of the cases (COVID -19) of the European Union/UUPD is showing similar trend in countries and United Kingdoms in the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 is rising on various levels based on the country's basis.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals, and deep care units should prepare themselves for rapid growth in the COVID-19 diseases that need health care, especially deep care.
On December 31, 1919, a group of non-communia-municators in Wuhan, Hubei province, China was indicated.
On 9 January 2020, China referred to Neville Coronnaires as a serious shock shock syndrome 2 (SARS-COV2) as leprosy.
Since then, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Correspondence disease (COVID-19).
The evidence is that 80% of people with COVID-19 are affected by the light disease, which is with Nimonia, or with the power road in Nimonia, and most of them are cured.
In 14%, the more serious disease required to be admitted to a COVID-19 hospital, the more serious disease is seen in the next 6% of other cases.
The death rate of victims in the hospital due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we point out the tendency of the COVID-19 pre-19 predom in every country or country of the European Union /EA (EUA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it with its Hubei province, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK in EU.
The case of COVID-19 in EU/EAA and UK.
After China, the COVID-19 expanded and currently active activity in the rest of the world of the COVID-19 to the rest of the plague moved from this country.
On March 11, 2020, the president of the World Society (WO) declared the plague on COVID-19.
Euroversance version of March 5, 2020, was reported first by the European COVID-19 cases, according to the WHO article.
In EU/EA, France was reported on 24 January 20th, Hubei province, China's first three-expectant cases were reported.
By March 20, 2020, all 30 EU/ESA and United Kingdom (UK) were found cases of COVID-19 in Italy alone, with only 17,750 cases between 16 December 20 and 1,4441 deaths between December 20 and that date were indicated.
COVID-19 to obtain a saved number and a prefecture of matters
In the European Disease Stop and Control Center (ECDC), only the official health facilities of the countries, such as the National and Regional Health Authority and WHO, are classified from every country to the COVID-19 cases of the world every morning.
These data were used in EU/EA and UK to analyze the tendency of COVID-19 and compare them to HIV in Italy.
As a representative of the active COVID-19 cases, we were estimated to count the 14 days of the COVID in each E-EA country and the natural process in the UK during the period of January 1 - 15, 20th.
We also displayed the last number of cases mentioned in each country by March 31, 2020, compared to Italy's period on January 31, 2020.
EU/EAYA's inspiration to COVID-19 in UK and UK.
EU/EAA countries and UK have a brief post of 14 days of 14 days of events in the 14 days of the COVID-19 cases, usually followed by the HH (picture 1).
In EU/EA and the whole U.E., the overall growth of the COVID-19 began around 21 February and grew faster around 28 February 20th.
It was primarily due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but the same trend in all EU/EA countries and in the UK was seen (unprecedented material).
Image showing the last number of cases of COVID-19 cases compared to 2 EU/EA and UK in the period of January 31 - 2020.
It especially indicates that by 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EAA countries and UK had already indicated the total number of negative cases in Italy only three weeks ago or less.
Our results suggest that the number of cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in EU/EA and UK.
The tendency seen in the past of COVID-19 suggests that the epidemic is increasing with relative speeds in all countries.
This should be done in various ways in different countries, in the national public health responses and in countries, there is probably evidence that there is a different protocol to select different issues and diseases, including the COVID-19 testing of the COVID-19.
At the beginning of March 2020, medical doctors in the affected areas of Italy spoke of a situation that needs to be cared for by 10% of the COVID-19, and media sources indicate that hospital and deep care in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
The statistics of the COVID-19 cases and/or deep care unit are currently available on EU/EA level for more than 6% and 1% of cases (not shown).
Though they should be organized in a position to manage current surveillance statistics, the number of cases and deaths that focus on the number of cases and the number of deaths.
In 2010-11, a large difference was seen in Europe's deep care and the availability of the central care rooms in Europe from 29.2 to 4.2 rooms in Portugal.
This means that the countries can expect Italy to have more or less resources (over $100,000 per 100,000 population per 200 in 2010-11).
The coverage of health care issues in the COVID-E-EA-EEA has been updated in the early decades of the EU and the EUCC on CODC's high-relative coverage of health concerns related to low care capacity in the hospital & 90% risk risking the health care capacity of the COVDC has been updated in the early hours of the CVDC on the CVID-19.
Since the case still exists in EU/EA/EAA, and some areas of the U.K, hospital and deep care services are usually served by individuals defined by means of information about cases and deep care rooms, information about matters and deep care must be available primarily by the Nominary U.S.A.A.
The experiences from Italy and other countries show the current trend in the COVID-19 epidemic EU/EAA and UKK.
In this way, hospitals, hospitals and deep care for SARS-COV-2 daily public transportation and health care, especially deep care, is being being taken in areas affected by Italy’s affected areas of COVID-19.
As recently promoted by the ECCDC, with the view to limiting the situation to sit down, the SARS-COVV2 needs rapid, fast, fast, and broad view of the spread of the spread of the media, since if time has not been activated, it may be possible that time has not been activated, that the forecasts in the number of cases may not be implemented, and may not yield sufficient time to grasp favorable decisions and respond to their response.
The intense risk is also listed by public health measures in reducing the effects of the epidemic.
In order to slow down the SARS-COV-2, the nations have few opportunities to increase their control efforts to increase their health care and reduce stress.
In this failed, it is very likely that there have to be a rapid rise in patients who need deep care in the days of EU/EA's health care system or weeks of deep care.
More than 3,000 people in China and China have been infected since the death of more than 8,000 people in China and others in China and the world, resulting in the result of the death of people.
Like his native Aires SARS-COV, which led to hundreds of thousands of people in 2003, the SARS-CV-2 can be transmitted with chimps and produces similar symptoms by the action.
However, the SARS of COVID-19 expects the following seriousness and death rate, but is much more sensitive and impacting young people and women's expectations for men and women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on the rising disease, this article tries to provide social and extensive reviews on the search topic.
We will include basic things on the main things on the epidemic of disease, for-consistencies, radiation, therapy, treatment, presumption and restricted.
However, many questions are still finding out, we hope that this review will help us understand and help improve it.
Because of the anger of the Novewell virus, on January 25, 2020, all Chinese people who were asked to stay in their homes for several weeks and then have been asked to stay home.
Virus is much similar to Coornavas (COV) which led to the most intense power syndrome in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CO by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was named by the CVS-CO2 (WO).
The plague began from China, China, and rapidly spread throughout the country and around 50 other countries.
By 20 March 2020, the virus caused more than 40,000 patients to leave the hospital and more than 3,000 patients with the death of COVID-19.
WHO warned that COVID-19 "the enemy number is "%1" and possibly more powerful than terrorism."
According to PubMed (https://www.nnnf.lm.lh.v/pubd/pube//) on January 20, 20th, in less than two months after the first report on January 20, the first two months of January 20th, the virus-encomputed, for-fed, for-med, for-m, and more articles on COVVID-200, including the COVID-200, which has been published on many of the patients.
This review attempts to present a summary of the search progress on the subject being new and faster developed.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare other diseases caused by COVID-19 with other diseases, Middle SARS and CoV, Middle Sven Sandrome (MARS, 2012).
We will also discuss what we have already learned about the preventing of disease and some of what we have yet to learn.
CoVs mainly produced approximately 15% of normal winters, which are commonly viewed as non-registerable for men.
However, in this century we have suffered twice the extremely sick human CoVs, including SARS-COV and MERS-COV, caused mainly in China and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread abroad with fear and death rate.
Thus, the currently COVID-19 recorded history of humans.
As picture shows in the picture 1, the flock of Nimonia, which was originally unknown, was one of the first points to Chinese national health issues since January 31, 2009.
Seven days later the CV sequence was issued.
On January 15, 2020, the first deadly case was indicated.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly in nearby cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, an announcement was received in health care providers, which indicated that human migration was possible from humans.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public windows.
On January 24, the first medical study indicated that only 21 of 41 cases of confirmed cases were directly related to the ocean food market, which was thought to be the start of an unknown biodiversity.
WHO declared the global health crisis on January 30.
By the time of this report, disease has already spread to nearly 50 other countries of China and the world (picture 2).
Since the situation is rapidly rising, the end of the propaganda has to be determined and intense.
On 11 February 2020, 40021 confirmed COVID-19 of the multi-century study of malaria in a multi-scale study of malaria patients (https://mp.wax.q.q/Ux.q/UXXXHXXHA) was presented in the following way.
SARS-COV-2 have been infected, but mainly from 30-65 years of age.
About half of the infected people (47.7%) were over 50 years of age, less than 20 years and only 14 infected people were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV2 expects women (0.27/100,000) from women.
COVID-19 mainly spread in Hawaii and around it.
COVID-19 was at least 5 (2-9) a day.
The average info duration was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day.
The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13).
Original supply number (0R0) was 3.7 (95% CI:3.51-05), and the correct R 2.0-3-3-4.82.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly since January 23, 2020, which corresponds to the growing interest in the media in China before they were engaged.
The death rate of confirmed cases was 1.4% (95% C.1.10-1.8%) and the rate of death rate of all diseases was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.0% C.4%).
The three major risked gender (human), age (60), and serious Nimonia.
CoVs is the top-power of large and underwear of RNA.A.
They can be divided into four generations — Alpha, Beta, Gama, and Delta, which are known as Alpha-CoVs.
(S) Glycopetein, SARS-COV and MERS-COS-Co-COV, are associated with ecliptic technology 2 (AC2) and the DPPD have a yellow yellow - and the yellow.
Weal RNA become natural in the genetics of the biochemical material; after the product of the wireless Gnonome, the iron gycophropotototos and the nucleroscopic proteins, which later become the genome of the virus.
The SARS-COV-2 first Gnominic sequence was indicated on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV-2 found a new form of beta-CoV, which was found in 10-century samples gathered from the original location of the Pope's VP.99.98%.9% of genetic equations.
SARS-COV-2 genetically expects merS-CoV more than SARS-COV.
The SARS-CoV-2 of human planes were found in high-milled blocks of air traffic.
Human ACE2 was found for SARS-COV with SARS-CV with SARS-2.
However, SARS-COV of SARV-2 is connected to human ACS-COV with more weakness than the possibility that the fact that SARS-CV-COV produces a lower risk of having SARS-CV in diseases.
SARS-CoV2, orf3b can also make the coded editions of the coded form and the coded form.
SARS-CoV2 can play role in wireless disease and prevent the expression of IFN, although there is no known effective domain or motorf inor8.
On February 18, 2020, Zou, Kate al. In mixing with the Aminal Association B0T1, the perfect human ACE2-E2-e-e-EEM construction of the full length at the resolution.
They found that the mix, with free and closed structures, was organized as a designer and a AC2-BAT1 mixing two ST1 that gives testimony to the identity and operation of CV.
B0AT1, could become a medical target for medical testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 operation.
Basic & Center feeder
It is known that the SARS-COV and MERS-COV were born in both chimps and in order to communicate with humans in order to communicate with the city cat and camel.
By comparing SARS-COVV-2 of SARVV2's racial comparison, the chimp was considered the basic health of SARS-CVVVV-2 because the new SARVS-J-J-JJJ-CL4 and b-COL-CL-COL-CV1, which is called the equivalent of 9.6%.
However, which middle cooks have not been able to help prevent the virus’s race through and continue to be clear.
Jei, the snake, proposed the snake as a carrier of virus in the human body, including the same restoration with S proton.
According to one study, researchers in Guangxhou, China, indicated that pangolin - often used in traditional Chinese medicine, the Chinese-CO-CoV2 and the CARC-2, is likely to be located on the basis of apocalyptic equality based in CARV-2-2-2.
However, there is still a lot of distance between 1% of both Gnonom is still large; therefore, waiting for decisive results for solid evidence (picture 33).
SARS-COV-2's material property is not primarily known yet.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV in the atmosphere can live at 48 hours and less than 20 °C and 40% of the material on the air for 5 days.
The SARS-CoV-2 can be equal.
It has been suggested that SARS-C-CV-2, 56 °C is sensitive for 30 minutes and that Perbannisian rays are sensitive to the rays; international, 75% of Eheranic acid, parloric acid, Perusteric acid, chlorine, and other biosolids are used effectively, but notably by the SARC.
The entire human population is generally lacking resistance to SARS-COV-2, and therefore it is extremely critical to the Nowell virus.
There is currently no extensive study in connection with SARS-COV-2 anti-CoV2 defense response.
Thus, we can only take the context of the past studies on the SARS-CV, especially on SARS-COV and MERS-COV (picture 4).
Normally, after entering the virus into the virus, it is identified by the system of C-Type-type re-spectors, Tol-Sustrators (TR), NOD-SL-S-Sid-S-Sidentre (RRR), and RG-RRR (RRRR) (RRRRRRR).
Through various ways, the voracious expression of virus providers, development of the development and type of IFNs, which limits the spread of virus and also keeps the microfuzzy in the microfuzzy fridges.
However, SARS-COV's N-COV can help the virus avoid anti-proton reactions.
Soon, favorable resistance is involved in fighting virus.
TLC here plays an important role in protecting the C4+ and the CD8+T cells.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the B8+ cells to produce viruses-related agents, and CD8+ cells are apparently killed by the virus.
T-Commerces produce the sitehocin to help the cells protect cells.
However, CV, killing T cells can interfere with T cells.
C3a and C5a, including the Tridens and the ideologies, must also fight with the power surge.
For example, the terrorists who were separated from the healthy disease have disabled the MERC-CV.
On the other hand, the extreme response of the immune system provides a large number of freedoms that can lead to serious damage of fiftiethes and other bodies, and also in the worst of bad conditions.
More likely to affect older and pregnant women and pregnant women with SARS-COV-2 feature in the group.
It is common that people who come into contact with more viruses or those whose work are related to conflict activities are more likely to be infected.
Based on a study of 425 cases in the first 425 cases in Wuhan, an average study of SARS-COV-2 is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days.
However, the study of 1,999 cases revealed that the interval period was 3 days long, and its limit was between 0 and 24 days.
As stated above, a recent study based on 8,86 cases reported that the execution period was 4.8 (3.7.2).
It is very important to keep the effective schedule on the most accurate expression period and thus prevent the virus from transmiting the virus to other people.
As a common practice, the virus may be contacted or infected by the infected people usually need to pay for 14 days.
Should the contracting period be extended for 24 days?
The bucks are often the major and the initial symptoms of the COVID-19 with no symptoms or other symptoms such as headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, pain, headaches, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, and fever.
A week after the beginning of the disease, some patients experienced the breathing pain and/hypoxia.
In serious cases, fast shock shock shocks in the diseases increased rapidly in the production of Stindhom, syndicated synthesis, and the rapid growth of the Kogulotia.
Without the fever and/or the fluffying symptoms and the fluctuations should be tested for the time before the virus is gone.
At the end of December 2019, the public study found that 98% of the symptoms were 98%, 76% for dry food, 55% had 3% and 8% to breathe for breath pain; 8% of the disease needed support.
Similar conclusions were indicated in two recent studys of the flock produced by family groups and with unsatisfyed people.
According to the 2012 public study, there was also a major fever (98%) in the MERS-COV diseases, dry food (47%), and breath pain (5%).
However, more than COVID-19, 80% of the disease needed treatment support in the 80% of these diseases and it corresponds to the MURS expected more than the MURS.
The tooth (26%) and the integrity of the neck (21%) were also seen in the MERS's disease.
SARS reported on fever (99%%), dry food (29%%), breathing pain (29%%), breath pain (40% -45%), teeth (201-25%), teeth (13-25%) and the accuracy of the ball (13-25%), and nearly 14% of the disease.
By February 14, the death of COVID-19 was 2% of the world's events reached 66,576.
According to estimates, by November 2002, the SARS death rate of 8,96 confirmed cases were 10%.
For MERCS, death rate was 37% of confirmed cases based on the public study of June 2012.
The first study indicated that SARS-COV-2 with R 007-7-1-1-7.23 believed interval (CI) was more than 647, while SARS-COV was only between 2 and 4.
SARS-COV-2 of the SARS-COV and SAR-COV is compared to table 1.0 of symptoms, death rate and R0.
Upside figures indicate that the ability to spread SARS-CoV-2 is more than MERCV and SARS-COV, but it is less deadly than both.
Thus, the expectations of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more challenging to control MERCVV and SARS-COV.
The start of the flock usually comes from the same family or one community, such as Kruzhe.
The disease has often been the history of travel or other affected areas within the last two weeks or other affected areas of the past two weeks.
However, it has been suggested that people can manage without symptoms for more than two weeks and then rebuild the correct virus from the hospital, which gives warning of increasing the duration of the fear of the bureaucratic time.
In the initial stage, the number of white blood cells is normal or less common.
For example, the white blood cell count & 1×9/L with the white cell count & 1×1/L; with 4 x109/L; 4 x109/L, was found in the Eppototox Ephronsofers level and a rise in the Estimate acids, 9909 CVID-19.
The blood of certain diseases increased to the level of physiological anesthesia and genomicins, and the blood of most diseases, including C-Protetrates, proteins, and erythrostrosis.
In serious cases, a product of fibrous frequencies, the degree of de-deformation in blood, and the LCCC's Compulsion went viral.
Most COVID-19 diseases have been found in Cine’s radios, and in FF, a double-blocking photographed photography or Grads of nature is shown.
The disease is often developed by unusual Nimonia, the intense pain of fifiers and intense shock syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS is, there is an unconstitutional provision, mass storage, and progressive Fibros are seriously compromised by Gas Exchange.
Type-I and type-I-Newsite reduces negative page levels and increases stress and thus reduces the capacity of fluffyness and increases risk of work.
Thus, the most devastating conclusion of Cine’s radiopress is often compatible with the most serious condition of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first disease in the disease was diagnosed with a disease that died from a disease that died from a disease in a patient’s lungs and became a vulnerability of the lymolin cells, and the lymphocytes of Lic cells, and the majority of the lymphocytes of the lymic cells, which were similar to the virus and the virus and SARS.S.
SARS-COV-2 RNA was used to identify the consequences of ROV-2-NA by RVID-19.
However, because of high-sensitivity rate, which can bring faster to the epidemic, 13 February 2020 was used for the lack of nanotechnology in China (now not only on RT-PR).
The same state was also associated with the SARS.
Thus, the history of disease, nanotechnology tests, and the combination of radioological conclusions is essential and essential.
On 14 February 2020, the FARS-COV-2 found a protocol using the CREPR-based SHROCK technology, without using a digital technology, found that 20 × 10-18 × 10-18 wines from 10 to 10-18 wines (in perennially 10-7 fn-2 fin per urn-r.7-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-R-R.
If there are been confirmed in the National samples, hope that new technology can improve sensitiveness and communication.
Because of the lack of experience with the Novel CoVs, the physician such as SARS-COVV and MERCVV and other viral diseases may be used to treat or provide special assistance to COV-19 patients with various alternative treatments (page 2).
These physicians include existing and possible treatment with antiviral drugs, anti-retroviral drugs, stylishides, correct diseases, well-being from the Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma was proposed to use plasma from correct diseases.
The drug companies have been involved in producing resistance and resistance to viruss.
SARS-COV-2 begins in the beginning and probably on other parts, such as ACE2, such as the complex system and neck.
Still, Sveshason has become a major threat to the disease and is the main cause of death.
Hence, the healing aid to free and save life from symptoms is important and includes normal oxygen, high - high - pressure oxygen, non-perception and access policy.
A heart-of-ffuficiative system that is used to help the immune system with serious skin loss of skin loss, life-suffocation, or stroke.
Also, electronics need to maintain balance, preventing and preventing treatment and synaptic scackling, and protecting the work of special organs.
It is known that the extreme response of the immune system in SARS and MERCS is the result of the immune system.
Sietocan Storm TNF, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFN, IFN, IFN, IFN, and MCP-1 are a form of a republished reaction to the site's unique reaction to the design of the site.
These sites promote a large number of free cells that are the main causes of ARDS and many body failure.
The treatment of fireman Sietoin Storm is needed in the treatment of serious diseases, especially in the treatment of serious diseases.
Corticistroid and Tossilioma, IL6-Ruconomb, used for treatment of the Seytoconn Storm.
Changes in other anti-retroviral treatment treatment for the site, IFN-1, IL-1, and TNF; JAKOOOOF; ; Bluenutmomomobi; and HADC.
Strawdy's treatment of SARS was widely used to reduce the seriousness of the threat.
However, SARS and COVID-19 diseases were not useful with the high-stead's high-steoporosis.
Instead, they can cause serious offenses, especially non-profits.
Yet, at the top of the middle of the mediumrs are advised to be careful to use a very seriously ill health processes in the COVID-19 diseases.
By the time of writing, no effective anti-Virtural therapy has been confirmed.
However, a remedicivator has been found to be effective in a COVID-19 of the U.S.A.
Remedicavier started with the Gilead School of Gilead for treatment by the Iboola and Malberg virus.
Later, Ramdisivier also showed the potential hazards of the MRS and SARS RNA virus.
On its basis, the Gilead Gilead has provided China for two experiments and expects its results to be very effective in both SARS-COV-CV-2-2 infected people.
Also, Barsinib, interferon-saninternare/tretonar, and Ribbinine have been developed as a potential medical cure for severe strokes.
In addition to antibiotics/trainor/trainor, there may be conflicting reactions to dentistry, votes, and other anti-depressive reactions.
Other medications used in these treatments should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and anti - resistance production from correct diseases
Blood has long been a long history of treating other patients who suffered from the same disease or of being infected with a infectious disease.
In fact, the high level of predators in the blood of correct patients is relatively relatively high.
In order to fight disease and other diseases, the evidence produced by the B LCCCC (IG) is img), and they recognize the unique particles in the immune system and disable them directly.
On its basis, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had been cured from COVID-19 and had been seriously cured of 10 diseases.
Their symptoms were improved within 24 hours with a better oxygen content and a better amount of energy weight and blood weight.
However, until certain medications are developed, there is a need for authentication and explanation for applying methods to use the system on a large level.
Also, despite medical influences, certain benefits should be taken seriously.
For example, antibates can exert a high-reference response and create the site's creation of synonym, which is perhaps a deadly risk of life.
The syringes in blood are generally low, and the demands of placards are more important to treat seriously ill patients.
It's hard to develop and produce very fast enough to fight global epidemics.
Therefore, it is more practical to analyze and evaluate impacts of B cells from well-beingd diseases and identifying the genetic code that coded effective advocates, or the need for the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of the terrorists.
TCM has been used to treat many kinds of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend primarily on the combination of different components of different components based on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most effective elements are still unknown or worthless because it is hard to extract and verify such objects or their actual settings.
Currently, one of the main alternative alternative treatments for COVID-19 has become one of the most effective and effective ways of the TCM, or those who have been cured with serious side effects.
For example, Shu Fang G. Caspians and Lying Laws were effective for treatment of COVID-19.
In several areas of China, including Gnu (6.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), TCM (50%) were seen the highest level in the Chinese treatment of COVID-19, while the Hubei region was only 30% of the CVID-19 cases.
However, this is a very strict comparison because many other effects, such as the number of diseases and seriousness of disease, should be included in appreciation.
On February 18, 2020, Lying Zang and its colleagues published a study of only Western medicine and WM and TCM's joint treatment.
He found that the WM+TCM group in a temperature of normal, symptoms and requirements needed to go and perform at the hospital were just as significant as the WM group expected.
The most influential, only the WM+CM group expected the fatal worst rate (7.4%) of the WM+CM group (7.4%), and the death rate (7.4%) of death was only expected in WMM+M+M+MCM (8%).
Yet, TCM's effective and security are still waiting for more efficient investigations in more central centres.
It would also be interesting to mark the system of operations and if possible, to make sure the effective components of TCM treatments or their connections are available.
The COVID-19 victims experience a lot of fear from extreme injuries and deadly diseases, and even people who are forced to experience sleep, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, there are symptoms of infection such as fever, lack of oxygen, and abnormal effects of treatment such as heart disease, heart disease, and strokes, such as heart disease, heart disease, and strokes.
At the beginning of the SARS protocol, constant stress, depression, anxiety, depression, mental enthusiasm, strokes, and even a number of mental disorders, including suicide.
The COVID-19 of the public health reactions of the Pope can make more sense of the impact of the impact on people as part of the public health reactions; touch people, touch people and their families and their families and friends.
Therefore, the common people should provide mental health care with the diseases of the COVID-19 patients, sensitive individuals and those who come in contact with them.
Mentalological support must include the use of cellular electronic devices and applications to avoid regular and sustainable connections with SARS-COV and treatment schemes and treatment schemes to avoid close contact with one another.
However, effective teams are required to interfere in the link to sensitive interactions with people with individuals and infected humans, and usually due to antiviral treatment under the control of the epidemic.
The efforts have been made to develop Stetan-based Tectan-based teams to generate long-term and powerful inactivity against SARS-COV.
SARS of live-s are appreciated in images of the SARS.
However, their safety is still determined before any navi effect on these prospective teams and their protection against the increase of the nuclear virus.
This is probably because the SARS ended slowly 17 years ago and no new case has been indicated since.
On the other hand, the presence of nuclear sources in the areas of the epidemic is due to the presence of the MERS and the flock are born in the middle of the Middle East and spread abroad.
Distortions for MERS have been developed for the lack of viruses, DNA platinums, viruses, viruses, viruses, and re-integrating proteins.
Developing SARS-CoV-2 is the most necessary and important work to control the epidemic.
However, the Tik's development requires a long period of time (in 18 months) and is challenging to overcome the rapid differences of CoVs.
As new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal his entire genetic process in thousands of diseases.
In most cases, the disease can gradually heal without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERCS, COVID-19 is also related to high blood pressure and death rate in serious cases.
Thus, health-vegetarian representations must be developed to determine the priority of their services, especially in limited resources.
On the basis of medical studies, the following COVID-19 patients may be affected or related (page 33:)
Age: Life was the most important factor for SARS's disease, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 cases, the COVID-19 was mainly in the age of 30-65, including 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, as described above.
There was more likely to be interdependence and genetics in the patients who needed deep care and expected them to be more outstanding age (51, 66 years of age), which suggests that the age of the COVID-19 sufferer age is expected.
Ling: More men have been attacked by women from SARS-COV-2 (0.311/100,000), as stated above.
Associations and criticisms: COVID-19 patients who need deep care are more likely to suffer from heart damage and disability.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in the SARS diseases.
It has been suggested that SARS-COV-2, AC2, aCC2-positive Collegiate Kolegisis can cause disease in COVID-19.
It is worthy of note that life and the existence of the immune system are deeply involved in disease and can interfere with each other.
A common experimental conclusion: The level of the CP (CRP) in the blood represents the seriousness or rise of the level of the process and is presented as potential precipitation to, disease, medical response, and finally correct.
The COVID-19 has also been proposed to cooperate with CPRP level from the CPR level.
In addition, increasing LDH can help to evaluate the results of the increase.
These sensors appear widely in multiple parts, especially in hearts and limbs, and during the severe loss.
Thus, they are traditional symbols of heart disease or heart disease.
Maindantic symptoms: COVID-19 of COVID-19 of other problems with other problems should be considered to be thought of for the consequences and prescipitation of the COVID-19.
The use of stridd: As mentioned above is generally anti-retroviral for reducing the seriousness of the Strawford Provider's damage to infected diseases.
Since the high price of the Quartode's high cost was widely used in the SARS diseases, many living survivors were suffering from malnutrition and bad life quality.
So, if necessary, the strewde should be used in COVID-19 diseases for the following doses and distortions.
Mental stress: As stated above, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress during the COVID-19, since they became a witness to the long duration of the Quarterine period and depth of tyrannism and the death of close family members and fellow patients.
These people need to provide psychological advice and long support to help get out of stress and return to normal life.
According to the public study of so far, the features of the COVID-19's SARS vary from the SARS to the SARS.
In addition to making a copy in the lower target road, SARS-CV-2 can perform successfully in the top-of-view road and does not cause light in other parts of operating areas like KoVs.
Thus, blood levels during the early phase of the early phase of the daily activity of the daily activity of the infected patient can be increased by creating a lot of difficulty in the control of the infected epidemic.
However, SARS-COV was considered to be a transition when patients were very sick, though most of the transitions were not during the start phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is hard to control and control the current SARS's curse.
With hope to put corruption in SARS-COV2 and the surrounding cities, the ongoing efforts in China have been in China, along with the ongoing distribution of lockdown and nearly all population.
Although these steps are dramaticly destroying economy and other areas of the country, the number of new diseases is dropping towards the bottom of the epidemic.
The most optimistic guess is that Pupp March will end up until the end of March and the bottom steps will continue for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, a tl., estimated that COVID-19 which appears to be more significant than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Lingini, a tal., set the representation to describe the results of the epidemic and indicated that SARS-COVV-2 could transmit the population of the world.
Canada's group reported that the SARS-COV-2 was correct and was identified two weeks ago in the middle-terrorism and the ends of the hospital that it was identified as the new virus, anesthesia.
However, China has received positive signals based on the low number of new cases, which indicates that the current strategy may be working.
At the beginning, Israel was expected to be a mixed case with half a million deaths of Iboola.
However, by the Kharton and separation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible that like SARS-COV-CV2, SARS-CV-2 will be weakened and end up at the end or become a low-reference low with man.
The COVID-19 of the epidemic is compared to SARS and ERS (Photo 55)
SARS-COV-2 is also very sensitive to the actual contact with infected materials from the virus and possibly from the virus.
Virus also was found in Mala, which also produces a new potential for spread.
A recent study of 138 cases indicated that 41% of cases including 17 other diseases and 40 health care providers were probably caused by medical intervention.
Hence, humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and patients should also be very careful to protect people or infected people.
The first row of defense that can be used to lower the risk of the infection is to wear masks; the classical mask and N95 Sunsk (Syria # 1860) helps control the virus's spread.
The masks of the sensitive face prevent the dead from going into the air or scrubbing on the surface of things, from which they can go to others.
However, with only 5% completely across the Vienna alone, only N95 (Syria #1860s) can prevent 80 nm from entering into the breath; SARS-CV2 size is similar to SAR-CV-COV2 and nearly 85 mm.
Since the cake can also pass up five sensitive masks on one above, open health care providers with patients should wear N95 (C95) masks, not unsanitary plastic masks.
With the masks, health care providers should wear anesthesia gloves to make contact with the virus.
The virus can transmit a person's eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-COV-2, although he was wearing N95 masks; perhaps the virus had entered the body through his eye.
Thus, health care providers should also wear the face of transparent face or skin masks while working with disease.
In affected or potentially affected areas, generals are strongly advised to wash their hands with more common soaps, try to stay inside the house for self-accatin, perhaps limiting contact with infected persons.
Three feet fit to keep people away from disease.
These activities are effective methods to prevent the spread of virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 came to the world as a new virus for the human world, as indicated on January 7, 2020, it would have been very careful to warn China based on the deep memory of the SARS Pop in 2003.
However, by January 19, 2020, the director of the World Health Center of the World Health Center comforted citizens by saying that the human-human capacity and limited pollution of the human-human capacity and limiting disease has no problem in preventing disease.
The message set up a lot of fear, especially when preparing the whole country's restaurants, and it took a dramatic time to limit the disease to a minimum level.
In China, disease control agencies can learn a greater lesson and improve the future.
For example, these agents must be careful when publicly announcing public declarations, since every word is important for citizens and can change their views and decisions; (2) instead of waiting for medical information from doctors or authorities; (3) trying to comfort ordinary information from classical information; (3) efforts to ease the severity of the plague and to increase the impact of publicization on the public society; and more people should be more sensitive to the spread of the population.
Nuvel Wars SARS-CV-2 started at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and around 50 other countries of China.
Since the virus is much similar to SARS-COVV-CVI and the presence of the COVID-19 and SARS, the captain of COVID-19 has encouraged SARS to be repeated.
However, there are some outstanding differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which need to limit and treat the epidemic and treat the disease.
COVID-19 expects young people to be more inclined to expect men and women's expectations, and more serious and death rates are the young.
SARS's death rate is greater than COVID-19 (10.11% make 1.4%).
COVID-19 also spread virus even while SARS often do so when they are seriously ill, which causes much difficulty in limiting the spread of SARS.
It literally explains why SARS-COV-2, the expectation of SARS-COV, spread with more rapid and widespreadness.
Regular RNA tests for SARS-COV-2 may be in some COVID-19 diseases.
On the other hand, healthy virus can be resurgent.
The results are dramaticly increasing the risk of the spread of virus.
Despite such rapid progress at COVID-19, many serious issues remain solved:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although SARS-COV-2 and two hush-like SARS was discovered by 96% of the KVs, we still cannot reach that conclusion that SARS-CV-2 has come from SARS-OV2.
Originally, what was the Middle Eastern race in the spread of virus in humans?
Without finding the answer to the http://t.co/2, we can't effectively stop the spread and may never be repressed.
Although nuclear simulations and biochemical experiments have been shown in the SARS-COV-2, how does the virus enter the airway and then change the disease?
Does the virus also build AC2-based cells in other bodies?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get fast and effective treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How is virus developing during human migration?
Will it become a global epidemic, like SARS, or will it be repeated repeatedly like flu?
This is required, but may take a while to find answers to several above and multiple other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the plague soon and bring our lives into normal state.
Human Correspondence Roots
For thousands of years of mutations and adaptation have developed the development of coonna viruss (CVs) and their nutritionals (including humans).
Prior to 2003, two men who caused a similar light disease were known about CoVs (HCVs).
The very intense power syndicam (SARS) and the presidents of the Middle World Syndrome (MARS) were completely replaced by HCOV's destructive and destructive nature, showing the damage and destructive nature of HCV.
At the end of 2019, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China has brought back the CVs and its sister has given us more significant capabilities than the SARS-COCOV, but the lack of disease.
HCV is a genetic disease and our work to understand the origin of HCVs.
Most of HCVs were born from chimps, including non-regarded.
Some HCVs also have information about the Central Cocoons of the HCV.
In the silence of human diseases, there are direct recognition of the identity of animals.
Also examining the inter-international activities of the CoV may be important to humans in general.
In this review, we present current information about seven HCVs focusing on the origins and genetics of the search history.
Significantly, we compare various HCVs from the perspective of virus development and genes to the view of genetic rehabilitation.
The current KV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this survey of the epidemic.
Also, the need to change the nutritional needs and the general development of the virus on the side of the disease has also been revealed.
Coronna virus (CVs) is from the Cornevis family, including members of the Involved-Synd-Sended RNA virus.
RNA viruss were named "CoVs" because of the "CoVs that protect the most of the genomics of 26 to 32 kgs of Glores.
structured, CoVs has a genome that resembles the structure.
Nearly two major reading frames in Gnom are the two big reading frames (OF1 and OF1b), which are transformed into pp1a and p1bp1b.
Polyproton's nsp1 =16 is further organized to produce 16 non-exactivation protein, named nsp1~16.
The rest of the Gnome contains ORF for the built proteins (SS), Envelop (E), Membrenin (M) and Nuclopeton (N).
Several families-specific assistant proteins are also being interpreted by various family groups of CoVs.
Based on differences in the Protestant sequences, CoV is divided into four generations (Falta-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gamma-CoV, and Delta-Co-COCV), most of the Beta-CoVs (A, B, and D).
The racial witness has seen that chimps and garbage are most of Alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are head of Gamma-CoVs and Delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs has successfully crossed the barriers and have raised some important human beings as victims.
To this day, seven human CoVs (HCVs) are known.
Among them are HCOV-29E and HCV-NL63 Alpha-COVs.
Other five beta-CoV43, HCV43, fast-HHKU1, very loud shock syndrome (SARSS-COV) (SARSS-COV) and SMSCV2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HU1 and HCOV-NL633, usually produces light symptoms like old and/or dry.
On the contrary, SARS-COV, MERCV-COV and newly identified SARS-COV-2, intense shock syndrome (ARDS) and the possibility of causing more serious infections in most cases are caused by more serious strokes.
The first HCoV-229E Nile, B814, was separated from the nose of drug patients in the mid 1960 ’ s.
Since then, an extensive study and information about HCOV-29E and HCOC43 has been collected through extensive study and information, of which both generates symptoms to limit themselves.
In fact, it was widely acknowledged that HCVs' infection is usually harmful to prior to the SARS.
The SARS is one of the most destructive curses in the present history of the death rate of nearly 10% of the death rate.
Ten years later, the Middle East Sun Sundroome (MARS) produced an ongoing epidemic in the world, along with the spread of the umbrella.
1919 Novel HCV (1920-nCoV), which was later named SARS-CoV2, is the agent of the Coorna Wars 2019 (COVID-19), which led to the death of 3,120 people and more than 11,000.
The alarm bell is ringing and the world is ready to be ready for the SARS-COV-2 coming plague.
All seven HCVs are the basic root of the rats, mice, or domestic animals.
Many testify to the rapid growth of all the HCVs, with virus well-impacted and non-registered, but displays extreme genetic differences.
COVID-19 has presented a huge medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the World.
Finding out the genetic source of HCVs provides a framework to understand the natural history of flooding, energy, and bonds.
It can guide or improve or improve the search for SARS-CoV-2 cells, central and growing plants with important effects to prevent the spread of the future.
In this review, we present a vision of HCVs' genetics, biodiversity and illness.
Especially, we shed light on that common subject and discuss that HCOVs' petres are dirty in their natural cells, but they become infected after the nuclear transmission.
We will also review the trend of HCV's progressive development that often contributes to a lack of disease.
The results of the SARS-CoV-2 post is also discussed.
The information of the animal CoVs is from the late 1930 ’ s.
Many infected organisms were separated from several infected organisms, including the HCOV-229E tubes that were first introduced before the death of infected common diseases.
Seven HCVs have been identified in the last decades.
History of HCV is a brief summary of the history of the history of the HCV. and will provide information and education.
HCoV-229E the first year of the above throne road was separated from the throne of the infected patients, which was later agreed to increase the WI-38 fiftieth lines of WI-38.
HCoV-229E has been observed in 10-20% of the diseases infected with fevers and cancers, bruises, anxiety, and the integrity of the throat.
Later in 1967, HCV-OC43 was separated from the traditional route and the body was separated from waste.
HCOV-OC43 features like the transition by HCV-229E, which are figuratively unnecessary from the attack with other parachutes such as fluorides and Rinosa A and Rinsoires.
HCoV-299E and HC-OC43 have been spread around the world, and they are likely to be prominently transmitted during the winter season.
Usually, these two viruses are less than a week, after which about 2 percent of the disease.
According to a study of human volunteers, light jobs have developed in the health - from HCOV-229E.
Instinctiveness is the condition of a serious sleep road in a few patients.
SARS, also known as "International Nimonia", was the first plague in human history, and was discovered for its third HCV, SARC-COV.
The first case of SARS can be marked at the end of 2002 in the Guangdong province of China.
SARS' epidemics record 8,096 cases with deaths involving 744 deaths along the number of countries and continents.
In addition to most media users, it was estimated that between 4 and 7 days of the normal development period and the maximum fuel effect of the disease can rise by 10 to 10 days because of all cases.
SARS-COV shows symptoms such as pain, headaches, headaches, distress, and cold in the early days of skin pain, after which the breath is displayed as symptoms after pain, headaches, headaches, and strokes.
Lanfanfiania, tested and increased technical work, is common with the use of Creative Commons SARS.
SARS is also seen in the SARS's diseases, the spread of the widespread airspace, the Apple Cells, and the growth of the microfestation.
About 20-30% of patients need deep care and communication later.
In addition to the low power road, there may be several parts with the site, including the siteokoin Storm, Yicken, and the kidneys, which can be particularly dangerous for disabled patients in these serious situations, especially for preventing them.
The virus was first separated from the open buffalos which had traveled from Guangxu to Hong Kong.
Since then, many efforts have been made to find HCV.
HCoV-N63 was separated from the 7-month child at the end of 2004 in the Netherlands.
At its beginning, it was found to be spread in an outback with little children, cataracts, and wheelchairs.
It is common to see cold, concrete, bucksis, and Broncology in the diseases caused by HCV-N63.
In another free study, the same virus was described as the shape of a nine-month boy who suffered from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was recognized in the Netherlands, it was actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that at least 4.7% of the common dust diseases are caused by HCV-NL63, and its extremely complex events occur during the early summer summer, spring and winter seasons.
HCRV-NL63 is related to the power-powered system, which is also referred to as "HOV-NL63".
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old bubonic man who was transferred to the hospital in Hong Kong with Nimonia and Brunei.
In addition to Nimonia and the Bronxite, HCOV-HKU1, the serious defamation of the community.
HCOV-NV3, like HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, was found all over the world with HCOV-HU1 light-hU1.
These four groups have been well-funded with HCVs, men have been better able to produce highly transmitted diseases, and they generally have little chance of being immunized, though, because of unknown reasons such as HCOV-L63, which has been caused by more anti-depressive subsidies of HCV.
Usually, when these HCV skillfully communicates and suppress the ability of humans to maintain themselves to humans, they become less or more infected.
MERC-CV for the first time in 2012, Saudi Arabia was separated from the faucets of 60 years of age, which developed a strong and denomination.
While most of the cases are established from Middle Eastern, close relations have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, the 2nd Poop went into effect in South Korea with 186 fundamental cases.
The MERS feature of the processoriomonia matchs the SARS.
Different from SARS, there have also been the failure of severe fevers in many cases, which have still been observed in the HCV diseases.
In more than 30% of diseases such as teeth and gums, there are severe symptoms such as colds and fevers.
By February 14, 2020, 34.4% of the high death rate was indicated with more than 2500 experiment cases, which make MERC-COV one of the most destructive viruses known.
From mid December 2019 to the end of the SARS-CV-2, totally found in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
The World Health Organization announced a public health crisis in the wake of SARS-COV-2 due to the hunger strike and gave the disease the name COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 34% of all cases have been confirmed by 90,053 cases throughout the world.
Significantly, the death rate of cases in Hui China is 4.2%, while it's out of 1.2%.2%.
SARS-COV-2 Boutkar, the SARS-CV, and MarsoV and MERCV.
Some diseases are also seen.
Nimonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can grow faster as a shock syndrome.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-CV-2 are very similar, they come into various branches of ethnic tribes.
SARS-COV-2 clearly expects a less patient patient, but more sensitive.
SARS-COV has been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
SARS-CoV2 has seen very interesting similarities and differences from other six HCVs to another six HCVs.
First, HCV is the duration of the diagnosis period and procedure.
In this respect, the SARS-COV-2 follows the general tendency of six HCOVs.
Second, the seriousness of the symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to that of the SARS-CoVVVV-229, HCOC43, HCV 43 and HCV3.
On the one hand, the transition of SARS-CoV2 shows features that are generally seen during the operation of the community with non-interactive, light, or without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small one of the serious cases of COVID-19, such as SARS-COV's intervention, is a little lower.
Third, the feature of the movement of SARS-CoV-2 is also seen in the community's role in the movement of the HCV and SARS-COV.
On one side, at least the cost of SARS-COV-2 has been achieved by at least as high as HCVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether SARS-COV-2 of SARV-2 is less likely to go after people like the SARS-CV and MERS-COCV cases.
Finally, like any other HCVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be discovered in samples of salt.
Whether the SARS-COV-2's economy-style migration, like SARS-COV, plays a role in at least some conditions, is to be explained by the study of the future.
It is also very interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 can be weathering like the case of HCVs.
Nevertheless, the features of SARS-COV-2, including the spread of disease, disease and survival, will be effective in the final outcome of POVID-19.
HCOVs from all four groups that produce light symptoms have been well applied to men.
From other perspectives, it may also be correct that humans may have better adjusted to these four HCVs.
In other words, both elders can survive HCOV diseases.
Those who cause serious illnesses among humans and those who develop serious HIV diseases have been eliminated.
To that end, there will be to copy HCVs in adequate limits to preventing nutritional inhibitors.
In this sense, as long as the SARS-COV-2 has been formed, and the more people transmit it, the more likely it is to be completely adaptable in humans.
If this is well applied well, humans will have to find it difficult to prevent it from contraception or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four groups have been spreading to human population in the human population creating an incompetence in the movement of imperfect diseases.
These viruses don't need animals.
On the contrary, extremely ill-treated SARS-COV and MERCV have not been properly adaptable to men and can't be kept in men.
They need to remain in their animal cell and to search for opportunities to spread out in a single or more central and growing human goals.
Both SAR-COV-2 features are similar to both SARS-COV-MARS-MERS-COV and four groups.
At least in the current time, it's very expensive like the company's HCVs.
However, it's less common than HCVs from the community and SARS-CV or MERCV or MERCV.
It remains to be seen that it will be fully adaptable to humans and will be transmitted to humans without any law or Middle Animals.
Before discussing HCVs' genetic development, the HCVs of HCVs, natural, cells, core, and quality products.
Any animal HCV is a progressive development provider, if he takes a very close ancestors with sharing high equality on the level of nuclear order.
The pet virus is generally adaptable and non-registered.
Similarly, the collapsers take refuge in HCV for a continuous and long time.
In both cases, the food becomes naturally infected and it is the natural nutrients of the HCOV or its vegetation virus.
On the other hand, if the HCV enters the right to enter or around it, it is not well adaptable in the new plant and often sick.
It can serve as the genetic human intervention source and play the role of the plant that communicates with humans' immune systems and then improves the levels of human infection.
If no HCV doesn't keep its transmission within the center, it can go into an accident.
On the other hand, HCVs can also be adaptable to Medicinal plant and can stay local for a long time.
In this case, the Meteorological Cocoons become a nutritionist.
According to the SARS report on the plague-fashioned data, the SARS official was the history of contact with animals playing the case.
Later, Serroprovis experiments indicated that the SAR-CV-CO-CO-RG was more widespread in animals expected of the public.
In the living market, masked Palm City and Rukon dog were identified as those of SARS-COV-CV, which is quite similar to the SARS-COV.
The fact that no SARS was reported to have been reported before all the seats in the market were killed.
However, it has been suggested that most of the living animals that are not coming in with the market, including wild animals, in the SARS-COV seat, or fields, in the SARS-CV city, which suggests that the masked sail seat can only be serious as a result of the seed growing between the sSV-ARV.
Significantly, since 80% of Guangxhou’s markets have the SARS-COV-CoV, many of these possibilities cannot be ignored that many of the tribes of small mammals can also be found to be the leading consumer of SARS-COV.
They seem to be the last consumer of SARS-COV.
According to SARS-CoV, the research for the natural plant of SAR-CoV showed a very close-up search for the SARS-COVs-based Rainsoofs Chak3 (SARVU3), which is found in the Chinese hospital.
These are positive to the Gnoum sequence of SARS-COV-CO-CH-RH-BOCU3.
These and other chimps share equality with CoVs, SARS-COV, 8-92% of nuclear sequences.
These studies have laid the foundation of a new trend that is the main source of human infectious diseases coming before them.
Many SARS such as CoVs (SL-COVs) have been identified in gums, but no one has been separated as a living virus except by WIV1.
Human ant is known as SARS-COV as the Grass-CV.
WIV1 was shown to be used as a cowgo, Sieve and Human ACE2 to use the collapsible entrance.
Interestingly, SARS patients were able to disable the srm on WIV1.
Until now, WIV1% of nuclear sequences are the most accurate ancestor of SARS-COV in chimpanzees, sharing equality.
Despite more similarities between these viruss, commonly it is thought that WIV1 SARS-COV is not nearly as close as the sARS-COV and not the upper body near SAR-CV.
National analysis of MERS-CoV is grouped into a group like the KV-HKU4 and the chimpanzee of KV-HHKU5.
The chiga uses the same yellow cow, depaptism pipes 4 (DPP4) for the entry of the KV-HKU4 and ERS-COV.
The RNA-based RNA-based RNA Palerez sequences are nearly as closely identified in Europe and Africa as Beta-CoV.
Until now, no one in the woods can find any MERS-COV alive.
MERC-COV and its nearest chimpanzee in the CV-HKU25 only corresponds only 87% nuclear sequence.
So, the chimp can't even feed the nearest cell in Mars-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that in many African countries, the camel-o-o-o-o-o-visis is a pro-dicator in many African countries like the Middle African root.
MERS-COV, like the virus found in humans, was separated from the skin of the nose, which indicates that the camel is an honest colloquial cells.
It is also significant that the camels commonly transferred with MERC-CV were generally seen but very many viruses were seen.
Significantly, the infected camel takes out not only by the power road but also by the Maldivian route, which is also the main route of the virus.
However, questions are still present, since there is no history of contact with the symbols before the beginning of a number of major cases, probably because of the human migration or an unknown way of finding MERS-COV.
The CoVTAG13-Co-CO26.2% of the nuclear equations separated from the Rhinoofofs.
Like the case of SARS-COS-COV and MERCV-2 and RTG13, enough is enough to set sequence difference between SARS-COV-2 and RTG13.
That's why the chicken can't grow near SARS-COV-2, until nearly as much as in the future can't be found.
Likely, the mid-SARS-CoV2 Middle Animals should be sold and killed out of a few wild species that were caused by a number of human migration cases.
A number of recent studies based on the Matangnomatic sequence have revealed that the group of Luppoli (Man Javaic) who is also known as SARS-COV2 can also take refuge from the SARS-CV2 linking Beta-CVs.
The new Pentagonal CoV is sharing the similarity with SARS-COV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the similarity of 90% of the nuclear sequence.
They share more sarS-CoV-2 partners in the ethnic family, including a 97.4% of the non-communicatorships with the SARS-COV-2.2 (RBD).
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 are very diverse despite most of the genetic code.
In the first study of Fefowl's first study, the fifidas were also reported to have been found from the major DNA group, which was similar to SARS-COV-2.
In this study, 86.3% of the wireless Gnomon sequences were taken to produce several different-dimensional synonym sequences and manual declarations.
We cannot deny the possibility that Pangolin SARS-COV-2 is one of the Middle Animals.
However, there is no evidence in the support of SARS-CO-CO-COV-2 of the sequence between SARS-COV-2 and PanoV-2-2-2-CVs, in support of the SARS-COV2's actual core base.
Also, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RTG3 and the far between SARS-COV2 and Pangoon SARS-COV-COV2 - is less than beta-CoVs.
The course of the SARS-COV2 has to be established in the search of chimps, panlins, and other buildings.
The most common sequence between SARS-CODV-2 and Pengolin is found in RBDs, SARS-CV-2-COT-COV-COV2 and RTG13.
This is a very interesting idea that Pengolin SARS-CoV-2-based Beta-CoVs and SARS-COVV-2 is due to an extreme equation of the central exchange of the RBDs of SBDs.
An alternative proposal is in the part of the rehabilitation between penguin SARS-COV-2-2-CO-CO-CO-COV and RTG13.
As the beginning of the progressive development power, the renovation is widely presented in the beta-CoVs.
SARS-COV-2 still don't know the actual root.
Extra study of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCV-NC3 and HC3 and HCV-HHHU1.
The ethnic witness was confirmed by HCOV-NL3 and HCV-229E, while both of HCOV-OC43 and HCV 43 and HCV-HU1.
It has been reported that a close relationship with the HCV-L63 of the HCV3 found in the three colors of North American America was found at ARCVV.
On the other hand, HCoV-29E Hiposeros/Ghanaquiwam/19/2018, another genetic genetic from KV, was found in Ghana, though, is also his name.
For explanation, the known HCOVs is given a summary image of current information on the origin of the information on the root of the information on the table 1 and table 2.
National analysis has given evidence of the rapid transitions in the history of HCVs.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed the nations to attack humans from the Akan-Pas-Papas-e-Palestine animals in 1890, the plague was seen.
The history of HCOV-229E is less clear.
HCoV-229E has been found a lot of Alpha-CoVs.
There's a short alpha-CoV between them.
Many witnesses support communication in direct human beings with the virus.
First, not man's share of the cravats were contacted by chimpanzees.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with the average.
Second, HCoV-299E-co-Co-Co-Co-Cheched gangs have different non-regards, though there was a plague in infected organisms due to short alpha-CoV.
Finally, the orange Alpha-CoV has not been found in wild beasts.
Hence, the possibility cannot be dismissed that the average HCOV-229-56-link Alpha-COV is receiving from men.
In fact, the chimps are the actual sources of carbon viruss, Ebola virus, Venus, and Hendawa viruss.
So it's not surprising that chimps can communicate directly to humans by sending HCOV-229E.
Alternatively, where the chimps are the genes pools of Alpha-CoVoV-229E, can be a disintegration and the camel-civists who communicate with the virus, just like the MERS-COV case of the case of the ERS-CV.
MERS-COV is an outstanding example of the nuclear transmission of the camel and the camel’s camel.
MERS-COV's initial development from chimpanzees is known to be known as its primary identity and strengthened by later conclusions.
It is evident that chimpanzees provide rich support for the genetics and genetics of the virus.
The long-term age, long-term cities, close social interactions, and the ability to fly are suitable circumstances to be "wear broadcaster".
On the other hand, the MERC-COV has been entered for decades.
It has been well applied to these camels who have turned into stable and natural cells from the Middle Ages.
MERC-CV produces a very light disease and produces a low mutation rate in these creatures.
It has been a fatal accident among humans, and man has become the last food in Mars-CoV because it can't be saved.
contrary to the function of the camels in the MERS-COV, the role of the SARS-COV-2 conversion, if any, it's different.
In particular, Panolin Beta-CoVs is a very sicker in the pangoonline.
They can be the last of SARS-COV-2-COT-COT-CVs in case of SARS-COV.
Many possibilities of the SARS-CoV-2 in humans are to be accepted or violated in future studies.
First, the chimps can be like an SARS-COV-2 of SARV-2.
Man can share the presence of a state with chimpanzees by killing, or killing, by killing, or by killing.
Second, the pangolin may be one of the consumers who entered the SARS-COV-2-based virus.
The virus is passed by by the breath of men, and by the breath of game songs.
It may be possible to be receptive to several of the SARS-COV-2, including pets.
In the domestic and wild animals, predators need protection.
Third, as mentioned above, the SARS-COV-2 may have happened in the third-class race that is linked to the chimpanzee and the pangolin.
SARS-COV-2 is still being discovered.
In addition to various kinds of biodiversity, three major factors are important to the CoV's population in connection with the virus.
First, their prospects in RNA Copy rate.
Compared to other RNA viruss, the new plant depends on the base of the CoV optimization rate ~10-4 per year with an average conversion rate with the CoV rate of 2 per year, the CV will be considered "high" from "old".
CoVs contains pref-regnated equations, which may cause extreme changes and loss of life.
Interestingly, necliotidee Engelomiciver, is considered to be the victim of the coV by the ecliptics, and the RNA-based RNA-based RNA Palerrees.
The most promising SARS-COV-2-2-Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro-Rided agents that are tested in the Remdiciative Research.
Yet, CoVs mutation rate every year is worth a million times as much as its nutritional value.
Also, mutation rate is more often when CoVs are not well adaptable to production.
Compare to SARS-COV with high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 migration rate is clearly lower, which points to higher level for humans.
Maybe it's already been adaptable to other foods around humans.
With SARS-COV-2, it also applies to MERS-COV which has been well recommended in mobile camels.
Strictly, it is not likely that genetic flow will slow down T and antiterrorism against SARS-CV-2 against SARV-2.
Second, in CoV, the largest RNA genome mutations and renovation puts extra plastics on the gnonomon change for renovation, which increases the possibility of an inductive coVs, which is useful for the development of NuVs when circumstances are appropriate.
This is supported by the early open reading frames and coded proteins at the end of Gnom.
Third, CoVs alters repeatedly during the RNA copy by the "OP-CO" action.
In the plant working as a blender, the change is usually during the CoV RNA translation.
The most common and genetic RNA can be re-organized and reorganized to produce new KVs.
EcOV-HkU1 and HC-OC43 are found in the MCV-OCS, such as SL-CVVV and MCH-H-HU9.
Various wireless operations with memory management
More important than the three wireless vehicles listed above are the wireless-in-activist intersecting of the virus.
Here, SARS-COV's recovery is seen as a common example, also showing a positive choice during the emergency transition events.
Based on a parallel analysis between human and seat SARS-COVs, especially with the SBD mutations of SBD, SARS-COV is considered to be faster in various consumers.
Usually, the RBD is associated with the RBD Kostites in the S of a CoV protocol and is selected with a healthy response to gravity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD S1 on 318th to 510th Aminon Amal which connects to human AC2 with its associates.
SARS-COV's RBD has been able to recognize the AEC2 planets, including the cat, the cat, and the RC2 planets, which include SBD-COV.
In fact, only 6 mmmones were seen separate from humans and seated in RBD, and 4 ACE2 of them are closely connected to the Gry-T.
There are K479N and S487T mutations in Siwt SARS-COV that can increase the pleasure of the Spike proteins with human AEC2.
In other words, these two unique unique variations can be significant in the cooperation of the virus among humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2, shares the same literary artwork with SARS-COV.
30% difference between S1-COV-2 and SARS-COV in SCV indicates that its human harmony with the SC2 can be changed.
In fact, the Kryo-EM study expects to join between the human AC2 and the SARS-COV S Sprotest to this union to 20 times more than 10 to 20 times more.
It also would be interested to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 should be required to have another partner.
Interestingly, HCOV-N63 also connects AC2, but from different parts of S.
Several other HCOV stars exist, such as the unilateral algorithms for HCOV-229E, and HCV-OC43 for 9-OC-OC43.
They too can be useful for successful CoVs' success in humans after the nuclearization of their animals.
The results of HCVs are also controlled by other nutritional support and restrictions, except by other nutritionists.
The differences of these healthy proteins between humans and HCVs, such as chimps, chimps, scooters and drums can be hindered.
HCVs has to hit and turn the waterless carnivators into a successful emergency policy.
In this regard, the virus-positive interaction remains to be identified and described in this important area of the area.
Using the latest technology of the CRCR, SARS-COV-OV-2 can produce non-dependence and non-interactive Gnobo-vep testing of cars.
Enhanced Novell HCVs: Return on base
The peanut provides sufficient opportunity to build a variety of Nova HCVs.
In this sense, the chimps work as HCVs, HCVs' genes.
Also, fast mutations and genetic renovation also contributes to HCV and works two important stages in this process.
For example, Nobel Protein-Pading genes have the ability to make a lot of changes.
In SARS-COV assistance programs, ORF8 has been considered to be significant to humans, since SARS-CV-CO-CV was separated, but they were able to decode various ORF8 proteins.
SARS-COVs feature 29-nucleotide in the beginning of the human epidemic.
It breaks ORF8 into ORFa and ORF8b and it is considered to be an adaptation that promotes change of cells.
Additionally, the potential recovery history of SARS-COV with the alpha-CoV and Gamma-CoVs exceptions, with a large number of smaller re-dependence fields identified in RNA-based RNA policies.
Sansp9, most of the nsp10, and reorganized locations in parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been seen that MERS-COV experienced reversing events among various ethnic groups, which took place in Saudi Arabia.
Additional renovation events of SARS-COV and MERS-COV were also seen in other HCVs, including other HCVs in their non-communicative genes.
Even more caution is that artificial selection can change the virus into the virus, perhaps because of the free virus from the choice medicine system, such as the drug system.
An example of these effects is the loss of the HCOV-229E Protypes in the HRF4.
While the axis can be seen in the chimpoV-22E and the camel-229E, the orange alpha-Co-Co-CoV shows a single necliptic entry, which is measured by the frame size.
But at the end, nowell HCVs is less important, even if the development of their cells is also under pressure of the pressure of choice in their cells.
It was only marked when the chimps were introduced by CoVs that promote the difference between the KVs and the chimpanzees.
It seemed that chimps have been well adjusted to CoVs.
For example, error in the impact of the process-inflammatory response in chimps, lowers the risk of disease caused by CoVs.
In addition, the immune system of the immune immune immune cells in the chimesgos is caused by the lower levels of JNG22/CD94, and the lower levels of IQ2/CD94, which is the lower level of IQ.
Moreover, the high levels of the chimegas can slow down the copy of the CoV from the high level of republishedness (ROS) and affect the reading reading, thus increases the pressure to enter the new plant.
More illnesses can also be developed by the recovery, which may lead to new proteins or protein features for nutritional optimization.
So, it's not a coincidence that three Nowell HCVs have come up in the last two decades.
CoVs chimes and camels, such as collapsing, are non-regarded or produces light symptoms.
Without showing strong pressure, they make a copy of it with strong resistance.
It is hidden in the secrets of why it is visible and why there are serious issues in human migration.
The serious symptoms, mainly resistance response and a lack of access to the site scanners, are due to the increased pressure of the more stressful side effects.
On the contrary, the resistance reaction has been different from the KV copy.
The SARS-CoV-2-like medical treatment of the same strategy can be effective to distinguish resistance.
Interferon's reaction is particularly intense in chimps.
Thus, the type I interferon's administration must be useful at least in the early phase of the SARS-COV-2 operation.
Also, the NLRP3 inflammation is flawed.
With this argument, the NLPRP3 inflammism can be useful in treatment with MCC950.
The SARS-CV-2 is followed by the common issue that led to SARS-COV and MERCV.
Where the chiga is seen with the SARS-COV of the SARS-COV, 95% nuclear equivalent to the SARS-COV-COV.
While Sitat and other animals in the market have been seen to take refuge, near SARS-COV has not been identified as the most Middle Middle-CoV.
SARS-COV-2 surprisedly found the same Panoolin Beta-CoVs, which indicates that the pangolin can be one of the best drugs or can contribute to the GARS-CVs in the last version of the JARS-OVV-2.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was originally created or therefore unregistered by human beings.
CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 has been discussed because of the recent Pope.
The study of CoVs and other animals has made a huge difference in our understanding of HCVs about the original and standard migration of the HCVs.
The coverage shows that SARS-COV, MERCV, and SARS-COV-2 are the basic waste of men and is the source of corruption among men.
In view of the invasion of SARS-COV, the impact of contact between humans and children in the market is caused by contact between individuals and the seat, closing the doors and killing the SARS has to be effective.
For the same reason, nearly a quarter of SARS-COV-2 of the Panoolin Beta-CoVs should be removed from the Pengolin to prevent the spread of genetic mutations.
However, whether the SARS-COV-2 goes into human beings and other mammals and how the future will be explained.
On the other hand, the MERC-COV has been entered for decades.
These camels are the main sources of meat, milk, honey, honey, and wool products as important for local people.
They're spread widely in Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to give up all the camels to control the MERS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 in China's wild market to prevent the spread of the spreading of the spreading of the MERCS-2.
To prevent MERCS's repeatedly-bard pop, the public view should be taken to develop effective TerS-COV against the effects of other constituent control measures.
Since we are not able to finish these viruses, we can stand up to new genes in order to produce the product.
VVs are roaming wild animals.
Especially in particular, the chiga CoVs with creative abilities are very different.
It is likely that these creatures have a job of development and renovation, which will lead to new CoVs that will be more lethal and/or killed in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wild animals in some areas of China must abandon the culture of eating.
SARS, MERCS and COVID-19 must create better prepared and response plans.
Actually, many viruses have been on planet Earth for a long time.
They remain in their natural cell until there is no possibility of spreading.
Although there are several features of chimps that help the spread of viruses, if people are taught to stay away from chimpanzees, the possibility of contact with humans and other wild nations can be reduced to less.
CoVs and their natural habitats need constant care to be provided to prevent the human migration and future from preventing the disease.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viruses from preventing the disease is to stay away from the natural cells of the human being.
SARS-COV-2 of the original puzzle puzzle still disappears.
First, if the chimps communicate to the SARS-COV-2-2-2-2-2- it's interesting to see what conditions inside chimps and pangolin can share the same condition.
Second, if the chimps play a direct role in human migration, it should be determined how humans come into contact with chimpanzees.
Third, if a third is acting as the real central part of the body, it should be clearly aware how this affects various species, including humans, chimpanzees and penguins.
In the end, since several breast members with domestic animals can be receptive to SARS-COV-2, both oversight and general intervention should be done.
Whether it is a peanut, pangolin, or any other food, it is expected that SARS-COV-2 or their petroleum virus will be recognized in their future.
In this region constant investigations will make clear the SARS-COV-2 development ways of animals with important effects in the preventing and control of the COVID.
COVID-19 needs to be updated by "the information case" and "the latest case"
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick-reference approach for the absence and treatment of the Noveel Corronvos (200-CV), and provided appropriate references to our experiences and treatment of the plague all over the world.
Although Cornavoros disease 2019 (COVID) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are growing slowly based on the results of the ongoing research and medical practice; therefore, there is always being updated, at least and also on the prevention of treatment.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our direction and provided the latest "intellectual issue" by the National Health Committee of the Chinese Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic of Congo (The Seventh Edition) and the latest "represented case" by the Chinese Democratic Organization.
In December 2019, Nowell Konovovos (200–nCoV), now officially named Coornaires 2019 (COVID–19) and the virus has been named as the most active superpoweredic convoyer 2-COV (SC-V2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO marked COVID-19 as a plague.
To fight the SARS-CoV2 invasion, our team has developed a quick-reference system and published online online in military medical research on 2006 February 20, 2020.
This has drawn much attention since being published.
Although note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and awareness of the results of the ongoing research and medical practice continue to increase; therefore, there are constantly being updated to the robots of both groups.
For example, there have been seven major versions of a series of changes in the context of a change in reference to a certain Chinese public health committee between January 1620 and 2020 by the National Health Organization (http://www.hc.c.c.g.c.c.c.c.c.c.c.c.n/).
Now a comment on our direction has been made by Zu At al., they have offered a simple presentation on the basis of their theocratic experience.
Their work added new evidence to our direction and gave valuable references to this epidemic.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work is required to be updated according to the latest and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 and according to recent studies.
According to the seventh version (March 2020), to investigate an extensive investigation of the matter, one object needs to be compiled with two items of medical terms, or if there is no clear epidemic history, three items need to be completed:
Major history: (1) The history of travel between the city and surrounding towns, or other communities, or the history of dwelling in the past 14 days; (2) the history of the COVID-CO-CO-2-2 sensitive sensitive sensitive sensitive sensitive sensitive issue; (with the history of the early cities and surrounding areas of the area;) and the earliest symptoms of disease, the earliest cases of disease, or other cases of disease, were found in the former communities.
NDX Expressions: (1) Buzzler and//or Schussion symptoms; (2) with the image of COVID-19 condition; (3) the number of white cells in the initial phase, low or lower.
The specified case must be based on an elemental issue of a diagnosis of an unknown illness or a serial evidence that is based on the following: (1) the following are the following: a Real-COV-CV-2-2-CTR test occurs; (2) the entire visual-based generals of general Gynono-COR; shows the degree of the general ferosis; and SG-V2G-2-2g testing of SGR; and SG-G-2-2-2-2. For example, the case should be considered to be based on an extremely high level of health change to an extreme degree.
We can see that the classic-time PCR test was added to the second and third versions (On January 1820).
The blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth version (8 February 2020): and the seventh version was added.
These were based on the ongoing work of research researchers, which are based on an instantalal identifying kit, as well as the pattern of the solar system including blood samples, which support the availability of various patterns, and the specific antisocial results.
Moreover, there are many evidence that remind us to be careful with antisocial and anti-depressive diseases.
So, Zhou's flow chart should be updated, because he has been classified as "unemporal risk".
The numeric system needs to be verified in the next theocratic study and study.
As conclusion, we hope that more clear evidence will come and invite readers to provide their comments.
For "the most accurate case" and "the exact case", we suggest to find out and follow the latest guidelines of their home country.
Our team will also update your direction on time-to-time to offer help.

Thailand has planned to make Kraf from 10 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.
The governor of Ohio announced that the order to stay at home in the Kingdom has been extended to May 1.
In Australia the number of looters once purchased toilets was reduced by the number of locomotives that were purchased at one time.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store sequences and Coloss and Collegiates once used to reduce the number of toilet plates that could be purchased in all their stores, and limit the order of each package.
ALDI also applied Monday to one-back limit.
These borders are posted on checkout sites and Facebook pages as messages.
It is said that because of the fear of COVID-19, genuines were buying for the situation to keep themselves separate for the situation.
On Wednesday, Walters also limited the access to the toilet paper for home delivery.
Wells and Coloss applied to buy the maximum four packs once before these changes.
Coloss said in his 8-hour press that despite the ban of four-Pakes, "many stores are ending within an hour of distribution", and described the application as unprecedented, where AlDI described it in a Facebook post to a press post.
According to a spokesman for Wulths, the last week of sales came to "the white rose".
The coast of Costa Rica was also limited to two packs last week.
To reduce the minimum, Colos gave the manufacturers and the large package lines and the distribution rate of delivery. Walvers ordered additional stock order, where the AllDI set up the pre-defined Wednesday specials to make sure that they are soon available.
The Australian Ritual Union director, Roel Sharmerman, said that trying to raise Ritiler Stark, but it is hard to do this at the time of the local survey.
In such cases as trying to fulfill the promise, and the number of special numbers has already been reduced, so Russell is expected to grow.
On Tuesday, LDI announced that after the Rock was released, some store Wednesdays can't operate special.
In a report in News.com.com.com, a retired director of the University of the University of Technology said that store store pays every night.
He told them that the toilet is a heavy item, so it doesn't get any more stocks, and then, after Sarah Stack's gone, the large-fashioned shells are empty, which gets a lack of sense and hard.
According to the ABC News, Russell Jamerman said, "This is the idea [that] if Paul and Wulversus had much stuff on, and could go to produce such products like the toilet paper and senatorser, and there could be a great amount of time, so it could probably be reduced."
Hu Gavis A Kryp, the creator of the resurgent toilet paper, told the last Wednesday that their stock had ended.

One day in Darwin, the NT News edition was an induction of eight pages that were given to use as a toilet paper.
According to a report from ABC Australia in the beginning of March 3, Australia, there was no intention of stopping store restrictions; the report said that they had no plans to ban the purchase.
Russell Xermerman added that other products are also a heavy demand, including masks, signatures, dry things, handwash, and atta.
Similarly, on Sunday evening outside Australia, two packs of bread were applied on Sunday morning, online Supermarket Oakdo.
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 global epidemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the World Health Organization's SARS COVID - the disease that occurred at the time of COVID-2.
Although the word "disgusting pestilence" simply means how far a disease spreads, not how dangerous it is, but WHO spoke of the need to move governments to action.
"All countries can change the way this global epidemic is now.
If the country finds disease in its response, treat the diseases, keep them separate from them, put them apart, and unite them," it was said WHO's Prime Minister Teds Erdom Garrisissis of the U.S.
"We are concerned about the anxiety levels of spread and seriousness, both of which are extremely concerned."
According to former director of the American Disease Control and Prevention Center, Dr. Tom Freedin, the global epidemic is “the oldest”.
In the comments published by CNN in February, he said: "No other power virus has ever been found in the world."
Gabriels also had such a thought when he said, "We haven't seen a global epidemic in the world where no one has ever seen it."
They said, "We have not been able to see that there will come to pass the destruction of the people. They will never be able to meet this day."
This new title of the global epidemic has been given after the WHO following the WHO announced public health crisis on international levels in January.
Dr Anthney Foopi, director of the U.S. National Journal and Armeric Disease Organization, said about the "one thing is going to happen, and it's going to be worse."
Assistted Press reported that by Thursday, COVID - less than 16,000 cases were in the world and over 4,600 died.
2019–20 The Great Depression of the Cold War is one of the most deadly epidemics caused by the SARS-COVV-2 (SARS-CV2) epidemic.
In December 2019 it was identified in Wuhan, China, which was declared a public health crisis on January 30, 20th, and was declared innocent on March 11, 2020.
By April 20, 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 in 210 countries and areas have been indicated, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 364, people are fine.
China's death rate has been estimated 4% since 13.04% of the world's population in Algeria since 13.04% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, headaches, and breath flowering.
The complexities can include Nimonia and the intense pain syndrome.
It's usually about five days from the start of the virus to the beginning of the virus, but it can be between two and four days.
It doesn't have any known criticism or specific antivatial treatment.
Primary treatment is particularly effective and helpful medicine. Practical measures include: wash your hands, keep your feet on the shoulders, keep your feet away from others, and keep them safe and self-stress for those who have doubts that they are infected.
The world's authorities have responded by applying travel restrictions, control of travel, campins, offices and facilities.
The plague has created a serious global social crisis, inspired by the game, religious, political, and cultural organizations to suspend or cancel or cancel, and has caused a widespread reduction in domestic purchases by people.
Schools and universitys are closed on national or local basis in 1933, and nearly 99.4 percent of the world's students have been affected.
The wrong information about virus has been online, and there have been cases of the anti-nophobia and discrimination of Chinese people, both East and South Asian origins, and other types of virus cases against other people.
The low travel and heavy industry has reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
At the beginning of January 2020, health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of the state of China) reported on December 31, 2019 with unknown reasons.
Most cases were connected with the small market of the Sea-Break, and therefore the virus is considered a natural origin.
Vocabulary is known as SARS-COV-2, known as Chagas-Co-2, which is a new discovery link to the pangoonin Coornaires, and SAR-COCV. Later on December 1, 2019, the first known person to be ill, and the next group was not related to his mother.
Two of the early cases mentioned in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unexpected report of South China Morning Post stated that a case was about a 55-year-old person in the Hubei province, which could be the first case on February 17, 2020. On February 26, WHO indicated that new cases in China, Italy, and southern Syria, were quickly increased within the first number of new cases.
In particular, there may be a lot of information in cases of light symptoms.
By February 26, there were fewer cases expected to be indicated in youths, between 19 and 20% of them were 2.4% of the world's affairs.
The cases refer to the number of people who were tested by COVID-19, and according to official protocol which is confirmed by the official protocol.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 percent of its population, and many countries such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland had official policy not only to test those who are critical.
A study published on March 16, found that in China, an estimated 23% of the COVID-19 transitions had not been identified until January, which was 79% of the reported cases.
One statistics published on March 30, estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was much higher than those mentioned.
Original estimate of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the American Disease Control and Prevention Center concluded that it could be 5.7.
COVID-19-19 the majority of the infected people are healed.
Those who are not fair are between the ages of 6 and 41 days of development, which is the most common 14 days.
By April 10, 2020, COVID - nearly 97,000 people were killed.
By February 5, nearly 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and in 75% of cases before the heart had been exposed. Official count of deaths from the COVID-19 is usually referred to as the COVID protocol.
The real death number from COVID-19 can be much greater, because it cannot include dead people in the home, such as in nursing home, etc.
An additional number of deaths during the epidemic are 4-5 times greater than the number of deaths by 4-5 times.
A spokesman for the American Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC) admitted that "We know that [the] death number of deaths has been attributed", a statement that is supported by less estimates in the United States.
The first death outside China was on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was on February 14 in France.
By February 28th, outside China, Iran, South Korea, and Italy were higher than a standard death.
By 13 March, it was announced in more than 40 countries and areas of the continent that are commonly used to determine the amount of death rate of death.
These numbers are different according to the area and time, and the amount of testing, the quality of health care system, the options of treatment, the time, and population features such as age, gender, and general health. The death - equal number represents the number of deaths by a fixed interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, global death rates by 10th to 2020 (9,03/11,617,2014).
It changes the number according to the area.
In China, an estimated 17.3% of death-mass ratio (for them which began between 1-10 and 20th January 2020) (for them, the symptoms have risen from the component 0.7%) (for which they have been started after 1 February 2020). In other ways, cases of death (CFR) are referred to as a percentage of deaths (CFR), deaths, deaths, deaths, and deaths (FR) and deaths (FR), a percentage of deaths (F) and deaths).
These statistics are not limited and act on a specific population until the case is settled.
Several academics have tried to calculate these numbers for the specific population.
The University of Oxford for Advendance Medicine estimates that a total of deaths between deaths between 0 and 0.39% and 0.39%.
The above estimates of this range correspond to the results of the first memorable investigation of COVID-19 in Germany and the impact of testing the CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the epidemic can be controlled.
The depth and the end of the cup is certain, and the end of the matter may differ according to the location.
"After giving up control of the Penn state University, the company's top priority is usually established and when the supply is not available for the disease, they begin to lose.
But it's almost impossible to predict when he's going to, yet it's almost impossible."
The Chinese government's superior medical counselor Jannshan argued that "it may end up to June" if all countries follow WHO’s advice to prevent viruses from spreading.
On March 17, London School of Higinal and Tracic Medicine said that SARS-COV-2 is going to be a tourist for one or two years."
According to the study of the Impactal College in the Lead of the Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be needed until a review is available (e.g. 18 months or more).
"I don't think it will end completely, because it's very easily spread," and it can change the disease every year."
The rise group will depend on the limit of change and mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be expected and infected people can be isolated.
Two of the most common symptoms are fevers (8%) and dry sugar (68%).
Less normal symptoms include: fatigue, breathing related power production (CF), loss of smell, pain of breath, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, headaches, spinal pain, spinal pain, dyna. According to WHO, about six people get sick and get sick.
The American Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC) is difficult to breathe, constant pain or pressure to breathe, constant nervousness or pressure, to wake up, to wake up, to wake up, and to face face face or face- to face; these symptoms are advised to take immediate care of when attending these symptoms.
Some of the infected people may be isolated, with no genetic symptoms, but the test results confirm the operation, so researchers have recommended that close surveillance and testing of people who have been confirmed should be removed.
Chinese estimates from some from some to 44%.
The normal disease period (between the beginning of the transition between the beginning of operations and symptoms) is a period of 14 days; it is most commonly about five days. One example of uncertainty, one of the estimates of the COVID-19 people who lost their consciousness, was 30% in the beginning and then 15% in 15%.
Some details about how disease spreads are yet to be determined.
It is believed that the disease is spread by small drop droplets (3 to 6 ft) in direct contact between close contact and close to close contact.
Studies have found that the leaves can go up to 8.2 meters (27 ft) from unpaved ceilings (15 ft) to 82 feet (2.2 m).
Some have proposed that the minor droplets produced during the virus can be spread by the air for longer periods of time, even when it is not usually caused by breathing while speaking.
The bottles can go to the mouth or noses of people who are near or perhaps in the lungs.
Some medical processes such as the nuclei access and heart-inflamic mercury (PCR) may be the result of the spread of the universe and the atmosphere.
It can even spread out when a man touches a unclean body with a discharge of skin, and then it touches his eyes, nose, or seal.
While there are also concerns that it can spread through the mouth, its risk is considered less likely to be at risk.
The Chinese government has rejected the possibility of the SARS-COV-2 Mal-2-2 Mal-mivation. The virus symptoms are the highest in three days since the beginning of the first three days, although communication may be possible before and after symptoms appear.
A test for people's disease for three days before the beginning of symptoms, which says it is possible to develop important symptoms.
There are only reports in the lab that have been confirmed, but some countries have been identified by alien transmission during the investigation of the contact.
According to the European Disease Control and Control Center (ECDC), although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually transmits two or three other persons from hours to days.
Especially, the virus was found worthy to be identified for three days, for three days on the plastic steel, and for a day, for four hours on cardboard, and for four hours on the stage.
Although it is different on the basis of tropical and temperatures. The experiment has come to COVID-19 for pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that virus can go to humans, though British authorities advise their hands to wash their hands after coming into contact with animals, such as the infected person.
The very intense power syndicates 2 (SSS-CoVV2) is a new virus that is introduced to three people connected to the group of the first severe strokes in the world.
All features of the Nobel SARS-COV-2 virus are found in the structure. Out of the human body, the virus dies from the home mold, which condensed its security condition.
It is believed that it's the virus of a genetic root.
Anthroviation analysis indicates that the sum of the sum of the two goose-weed-weed negotiators, a group of subsidiators (required B).
This is equal to the 96% of the other four gonomes of coordinators (BatCovo RatG13) on the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that some of the genome sequences between the penguins and humans were only amino acid.
In comparison to the entire Gnonom, the normal ratio between the Pengolin Coornawis and the SAR-CoV-2 has been reached to maximum 92%, which is sufficient to provide pangolins.
The address of the infection may be based on symptoms of viruses, though the transliteration of the confirmation of the confirmation of a certain end of the transmigration series (RT-PRR) is based on the operation of the transversalization series (RT-PRR) or the CT images.
A study comparing the PCR CRT in Venezuela suggested that CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, though many of its images are more sensitive than other nanomedics and diseases.
By March 2020, the American College of Radios has recommended that "COVID-19 should not be used as a primary test" to test or eliminate the CT.
WHO has published several RNA tests for SARS-COV-2, first version of January 17.
This test is used by the real-time translation transliteration protocol (RT-PRR).
This test can be done on the subsidiary or blood samples.
The results usually appear within hours.
This test is generally used on the NASAsi, but even a ball’s skin can be used. Many experiments and companies are developing a serologic experiment to detect the resistance.
By April 620, none of these have proved sufficient accuracy to be able to access widely.
A serial experiment developed by Celx in the United States has been approved only by experimental experiments.
Photography features on the radiography and compact tomography (CT) include uncomplicated global problems and missing fuffs.
The film is reporting an international online database of an international online database for the actions made by Italian radios.
Because of comparison with other transitions such as Advenvers, images are limited to identifying COVID-19 without confirmation by the PCR.
In a big study in China, CTC's results were compared to PCR's results and shown that although the image is less specific for transmission, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its idea as a screening tool in the epidemic areas.
creative knowledge-based blue networks have been developed to detect the image of virus with radiograph and CT both.
To prevent disease transmission, in the camps, maintain perfect personal hygiene, wash your hands, noses, noses, and hands without touching or touching hands without touching or touching a seal, and to put it straight into the kitchen.
Those who may already be infected are advised to wear the nuclear masks on public places.
It is also recommended that many governments have banned non-regnounced non-usive investments in countries and regions affected by propaganda or not.
Although the Great Wars of the World has reached the end of a cultural transition.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community don't know where and how they were infected. Those caring for a infected person are advised to take care of standard warning, contact alerts and protect the eyes, and to prevent infection.
For this purpose, the government has also raised awareness of privacy in the location of mobile phones, for which the Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for this purpose.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and by April 7, 2020, more experienced groups were working on privacy-related solutions such as using Bluetooth to log close to other cellphones.
The user then gets a message if they're in contact with a COVID-19 test-19. Wrong ideas about preventing the operation are spreading; for example, the nose and masks are not effective.
No COVID-19 criticisms are available, though many organizations are working to develop a criticism.
It is recommended to wash hands in order to prevent disease transmission.
The CDC allows people to wash at least 20 seconds with soap and water, especially after going to toilet; before they go to bed; and before eating, and after cleaning or cleaning.
This is because the virus is killed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective bubble.
In addition, CDC has recommended using at least 60% alcoholal-basedhand synthesis, when soap and water are not easily available.
WHO counsels people to avoid touching eyes, noses, or seal without washing.
The bodies can be cut through a number of horses including 62–71% anesthesal, 50–100% of the Isopropanol, 0.1% out of Hyppolooporide, 0.5%, and 0.2–7.5% of PVVonianian-Aidin.
Other horses, such as Benjalonium Clorde and Chromedididin Gloucet, are less effective.
The CDC suggests that if the COVID issues such as office or designer are confirmed or confirmed, such as the COVID case should be used in all fields such as offices, toilets, public sites, cell phones, and remote servers.
The health organization suggests that people turn their mouth and noses off when they eat or bury their nose and noses, or they will immediately take an immediate action.
Public masks are recommended for those who can be infected, because talking to masks, loss of breath, and a lack of breath that can be limited to the number of breaths spread on the mask.
WHO has issued instructions about when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin of the University of Leeds, “as a result of wearing masks can reduce the interest of people’s faces, which is a major source of infection without the properness of hand washing. Masks are also allowed by those who are being treated by someone who is ill.
WHO has only allowed masks to wear masks by people who are in high risk, such as those who are caring for the COVID-19, even though they also admit that masking masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started to encourage the use of the face masks by ordinary people.
In the United States, CDC urges wearing the mask of non-symmetrical face masks. China has particularly recommended using the use of non-profit medical masks by ordinary people, especially when they come close to close contact with other people.
Hong Kong uses public transportation or stay in crowded places.
Thailand’s health officials are urging people to make clothes masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned leaving public places without having masks or noses or noses.
Wetname has requested everyone to wear face masks on March 16, and go to public areas for safety of others.
The Australian government has made it necessary to wear face masks to all who enter the rent shop.
Irryel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when they go to public territory.
Every day since the middle March, Taiwan, producing ten million masks, has made it necessary to wear face masks on April 1 through trains and space buses.
Panama has made it necessary to wear face masks when leaving, while it is also forbidden for those who can't buy face masks.
In Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore, it is also widely used in Japan.
Making social distance (also known as physical distance) includes the intervention process, which aims to reduce close contact between individuals and slow the spread of disease.
In this way, there are many ways to keep moving; travel restrictions; and colleges, offices, stadiums, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can live at home, limit their travel, use a greeting without contact, and apply ways to make themselves social away from others.
Many governments are now being advised to make social distances in affected areas.
The U.S. government staff and health organizations slowed down in the majority of the population (if no known COVID-19), between 50 and 10 people (if no known region had any known COV-19 divisions), and was later released to the 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public population of more than two people.
Using the word "building social distance", it was justified that people should choose the full social level rather than allowing others to stay in contact with others through alternative devices. Some authorities have continued the Yun health direction to be used during the epidemic.
These are the only ones who are with you who are not infected with viruses or viruses.
The COVID-19 and those who doubt to be infected have been advised at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for the proper self-equivocality, which many governments have granted themselves or approval to the entire population of affected areas.
The most self-current instructions have been issued in high risk groups.
The person who can come to contact from COVID-19 and who have recently visited a person who has recently been in a country or region has been asked to volunteer for 14 days from the last serious risk.
The radiation of a Pope's control is poison or despondency, and Shaman.
In the early stages of propaganda, the purpose is to identify infected people as well as to apply other methods and criticisms to control infection so that disease can be prevented from spreading into the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of disease, efforts go into a peaceful state: the methods to slow the spread and reduce its effects on health systems and society.
The combination of both the infected and the lion can be made at the same time.
There is a need for more careful measures to reduce the original mass number from 1 to the bottom of the epidemic. One part of the struggle to manage the disease is to reduce the throttle range of the epidemic curves that are known to reduce the plague curves.
It reduces the risk of treatment for health services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-recovered interventions that can manage the Pope include personal care, such as cleaning the hands, wearing the mask on the face, wearing the mask on the face; maintaining physical solutions to preventing physical problems and canceling social meetings programs; such as acceptable and social meeting programs; such interventions to participate in the mutual assembly programs as necessary, as well as to participate in the hard efforts of the cities to manage them.
Other countries also adopted various methods to limit the virus's spread.
South Korea started a massive investigation and the local restricted control, and continued to give warnings on the voices of the infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to the infected people who contributed themselves and those who failed to do so made a huge debt on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and punished the mass mass of medical personnel. The example of Great Britain and the United States shows that Sheman (not slowing down but slowing down the spread of Myanmar) and Dhan (in contrast to the development of the country).
Etym sanitary principles can reduce the demand for moderate health care by 2/3 to half, but after that, hundreds of people die and health disorders continue.
There can be priority, but it needs to be kept until the virus is spread in human population (or if there is a review already), otherwise, there is a direct response from Chitti's solutions.
Long-term intervention for the epidemic's loss creates social and economic problems.
No special antiviral drugs for COVID-19 are allowed, but efforts are running with the tests of current drugs.
Taking medications without symptoms can help reduce symptoms.
On the basis of seriousness, oxygen can be needed, at the end of the calculus, material and power aid.
The consequences can be worse than using stridd.
Many sexually transmitted diseases that are already approved for treatment are being tested in the COVID-19 treatment.
According to WHO, some "Permic and domestic treatment" can provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-COV19.
Increase capacity for the needs of the COVID-19 illness and adapting health care, is described as a fundamental reaction solution by WHO.
The European Regional Office of ECDC and WHO has issued instructions to transfer resources to hospitals and primary health care services, including: focusing on technical services on COVID-19 tests, whenever possible to cancel selection operations, COVID 19-19, and further increase the efficiency of health care and increase in the number of operations by the COVDC and the increase of the number of operations.
Many don't think the first case could have happened.
The first known case of Noel Coornavas was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 2019.
Within a month, the number of cases of Coronnavas in Hubei grew slowly.
These were most linked to the short market of the Huan Sea-Murry market, which was sold by the living creatures, and one is not that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, it was the origin of the genome, which was seen on December 26, and was seen by the uncivilized group on December 26, which appeared in the province of Hussain, which appeared in the province of Xinxya.
On December 30, a group of medical doctors from the Vanhen Central Hospital warned their colleagues about "SARS-JES Cornaires".
In charge of spreading false rumors, the police warned eight doctors, including Li Wenley, and another physician, who was arrested by their superiors by their superiors.
The town of WHO was later released on December 31, after a public notice was issued and indicated to WHO.
Health officials were warned of a lot of cases of unknown Nimonia, resulting in the start of January. During the early seven days of Prakop's beginning, the number of cases was nearly two and a half days.
In the beginning and middle of January 2020, the sound of the Chinese New Year went viral in other Chinese provinces because of the Chinese New Year's International Center and the principal railway Exchange Exchange Exchange Exchange.
On January 20, China set up about 140 new cases a day, including two and a person in Beijing.
The later official figures indicate that the symptoms had already developed between January 6, 2017 and January 20, 2020. By March 26, the United States has wiped China and Italy across the world with the most significant number of cases. By April 20, 2020, more than 1.6 million people have been killed; more than 96,000 people have died.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and areas.
Because of the epidemic in Europe, several countries in the chain have banned independent voices and established boundaries control.
National reactions such as the cost measures (the command to live on home, to be known as refuge, or as lockdown). By April 2, nearly 300 million people or about 90% of the population in the United States are in some form of lockdowns in South Africa, around 50 million people in South Africa, and about 5 million in South and South.
On March 26, there were 1.7 billion people around the world in some form of Lockdown, two days later, up to 2.6 billion people - about one third of the world's population.
On December 20, 1919 of the first confirmed case of COVID-19; a report indicates that the first case was on November 17th.
On December 26, XXXian saw a group of cases of non-communia cases on December 26, after his hospital pointed out to Wuhanan CDC on December 27.
On December 27, 2019, an early genetic test of the disease's samples indicated the presence of a SARS-Jaze cooranaweis.
A public notice was issued on December 31.
WHO was indicated that day.
After these reports, the police in Wuhan were warned to "provides" about the Pope.
The Chinese National Health Association initially claimed that there was no "exposure evidence" of human-human-humanization.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched an intense campaign to stop the spread of virus, called "war of the People's War" by the Chinese Communist Party.
As described in human history, on January 23, a siege area was announced to prevent the sound of voices in Wubei, which had increased to 15 cities, which affected 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was banned.
The Chinese New Year (June 25) celebration was cancelled in several places.
Courts also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hocson Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Linchson Hospital, was later built to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China changed 14 other facilities such as assemblies and stadiums in Wuhan to temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government sought extra assistance to continue the health announcements for the passengers, and to prevent the COVID-19-191-Ep, with the expansion of the holiday holiday.
The universitys and schools throughout the country were also shut down.
Hong Kong and Macau areas have established several solutions, especially in regard to schools and universities.
Measures were established to work far away in many Chinese areas.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside.
Public transport was modified, and museums were temporarily suspended throughout China.
In many cities, public voices were controlled, and it has been estimated that nearly 760 million people (more than a population) had to face any form of external restrictions. After arriving in their global square in March, the Chinese authorities took steps to stop the use of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has set up 14-day contracts for all international passengers to enter the city. On 23 March, on March 23th, there was only one case on domestic level in China in the last five days, in this example.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Lee Kakong indicated that the spread of affairs on the domestic level has been largely blocked and the Pope has been controlled in China.

The Chinese government encouraged March 30 to reopen businesses and factories and provided financial encouragement for business. The state Council started a day with a national festival on April 1, 4 on April 4, a day in mourning with three minutes, which was at the time of the Kingington celebration, said to the families that they were going to carry out the CVA to make up the CVI-EP.
The spread of COVID-19 in South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020 from China.
The government's health agency set an outstanding increase in the cases confirmed on February 20, which was to be gathered in a new religious movement called the Roguen Church of Jesus.
The Chineses who came from Wuhan to Diigu were also involved in the creation of Prapap.
By February 22, 1, 1,261 of the members of the church's 936 parties reported symptoms, or about 13% of them, South Korea announced the highest level on 23 February 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 documented cases were passed in Korea, over 29 February.
All South Korean soldiers were given control when tests confirmed that three soldiers were sufficient for virus.
Airline programs were also affected and therefore changed. The program which South Korea offered to investigate the population of the virus and to identify those infected with them as well as to identify those who were the greatest and most organized organizations in the world.
In the screening ways of the new international arrivals through mobile applications, the essential self-defense of symptoms by new international arrivals, quick examinations for the next day, and each day, to improve the ability of 20,000 people to examine the virus.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the Pope, despite not controlling the entire cities, and the South Korean society was at the beginning to respond to the threat of President Menon J.
Many Koreans either signed or praised the government's alleged abuses, or praised his reaction.
On March 23, it was indicated that in South Korea there were at least one day cases of at least four weeks.
It was indicated on March 29, that all new foreign arrivals from April 1 will be held for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing from 121 countries.
In February 19 Iran informed of his prior decisions on the SARS-COV-2 invasion in Kom, where two people died that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Preliminary measures announced by the government included stopping music programs and other cultural programs, sports programs, and Friday's dances, and colleges, high schools and colleges.

Svshason Coornavases disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the search for SARS-COVV-2 virus, also includes methods to detect the presence of virus and to identify potential victims as reaction to infection.
In samples, the presence of the virus is confirmed by RT-PR, which detects RNA's RNAs.
This is special and is designed to determine the RNA of SARS-COV-2 virus.
This is used to confirm recent or active transmissions.
The users can be used to detect potential threats, at least for both of them.
Tests show how many people have had diseases, including those with whom were very light or very cold to indicate the symptoms.
The results of this test can determine the exact death rate of disease rate and mass resistance among people.
Because of limited testing, by March 20, 2020, people had no reliable data on the virus’s spread.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3 percent of its population, and how many have been tested in various countries.
There is also the possibility of the death rate of this crisis to have significant impact on the death rate in certain countries.
Using real-time transliteration transport policy (RT-PR), it can be tested on various styles of chrT-PR, including the nissi fy or force of force.
The results usually become available in 2 days.
The first week of the RT-PC testing with Gull’s bones is reliable.
Later the virus can disappear from the gal, while it continues to grow in the fiftieth.
For those tested in the second week, the sample content can be taken from inside the air by the toilet or used in the kitchen.
One of the early early PCR tests in Berlin was developed in January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO).
United Kingdom has also developed Kit on January 23, 2020, which was developed by the company Cognacioteuk of South Korea on January 28, 2020.
This is all Beta Coorvovos who are shared by the USDR-COV and especially found in the SRRV-2. In China, the BGI Group's National Medical Products Department of CRC-V2 was first checked from the CRC-based SRC-CV2C-2 CVDC (E) to the United States in the United States.
One of three genetic experiments in the old versions of the Kitt came to an end with an unconstitutional results, and a problem arose on CDC in the Atlantic; this caused the average of over 100 samples successfully managed in one day in February 2020.
Using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and not allowed to start checking the state and local facilities.
A recent test by food and medicine administration under emergency approval was approved. The US commercial companies started to examine early in March 2020.
By 5 March 2020, Labekcorp announced the discovery of COVID-PR based on RT-PC.
Quast Diagnostics made a search for COVID-19 across the country by March 9, 2020.
No volume suffixs were announced; samples must be merged and processing CDC needs.
In Russia, the study of COVID-19 was developed and produced by the state Research Center of Verlucology and Biochemical VICTO.
On 11 February 20, it was registered by the Federal Service Force for Health in Helkater on 11 February 20, 2020. On 12 March 2020, a report was received to investigate the impact of Myo KVID-19. On 13 March 20 to 20 March 20th, the Roosevelt's Dygestins were allowed to run high hours with a higher amount of trial within 3.5 hours.
On March 19, 1920, FDA issued a severe access to the m2000 m2000 system; FA (EUA); FDA was released by the FDA; FDA, the first Holoccupy, and thermophic press.
On March 21, 2020, he received EUA for an investigation from FDA that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test that is used by the Isothical acid acid ipiphation technology instead of the PCR.
Since it does not require a series of modified temperature cycles, this method can have negative results in less than five minutes and in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 machines in U.S. and Abbott wants to build for 50,000 tests each day. A check is developing in Taiwan, which is especially used in Monocloylonian's Nuclear Protocol's Nuclear Protocol (NTEN). It can be checked with the intensity of the 15 minutes associated with this fever.
In an analysis of a publication of March 20, 2020, it concluded that "the low-resociation of Zion radiographics in the initial phase is a low priority, while before the symptoms begin to arrive, CT [comprising Tomography] may be available."
Special features of CT include introductions, incomplete and back-end distribution with the Bulteral Multiulber Ground-games Oppression.
As the disease increases, the effect of Subplore, the crisscrossing and syringes develop.
A study comparing the PCR's CRT at the current epidemic point, according to CTC's CRT's CT features, has suggested that it is more sensitive than the expected PCR's expected of the PCR, although it is very sensitive.
By March 2020, the American College of Radios recommended that "COVID should not be used as a test or the first row check for the CD primary tests." By March 2020, the PC for the CD primary check.
Part of the opposition reaction to the infection includes production of IgM and IgG.
These can be used to determine the impact of resistance between individuals starting from the beginning of symptoms and to determine the impact of people's initiatives (CLT) or by the test-of-off experiments (COT).
The high-power systems with high-power capacity will be able to do these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
The standard sample of blood for CLT is generally used, though the series of samples can be used to see the anti-corruption response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from the synthesis sample sample.
There is no need to step forward before a different test of the PCR methods. On March 26, 2020, FDA named 29 units who gave instructions to the agency when necessary and thus are now able to distribute their resistance tests.
By the end of March 2020, only a test was approved by FDA by the authorities under FDA. At the end of March 2020, the European Medicin Meteorological Diagnostics received approval for their investigations and IGIG for the IG virus.
The ability to examine hundreds of samples within a few hours and therefore is quite bright for the traditional PCR testing of the wireless RNA.
In the early 14 days of the invasion of the terrorists, the UK found that no mutual tests they bought were well enough to use.
Hong Kong created plans in which the infected patients can live at home, "Your department will provide a sample of the disease," they will push back in there and get a few tests. British NHS announced that they are planning to check on the home of medical matters that are intended to take care of other patients if they are used to take care of the disease or the health care of others in the U.S.A.
The drive-throp check centres have helped to examine the fastest, most widely in any country in South Korea. In Germany, National Assissores of Stysier Institions of Stigersers, the March 2 in March said that they had the ability to examine about 12,000 each day in the Embletary settings of the last week and the last week.
When the owner of the test is given by the medical doctor, the cost is taken by health insurance.
According to the president of Robert Cotch Institute, the total capacity of Germany is 160,000 per week.
By March 19, the drive-throp tests were closed in many large cities.
By March 26, 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was not known, since only plastic results were indicated.
The first experimental survey showed that between 12/20 and 2020, at least 483,295 samples were checked for 33,491 (6.9%) samples for SARS-COV2. In Jezreel, if researched by the Technologies was discovered by the National Hospital and discovered by the National Hospital in the United States (2014), it would have been the first time to examine the original method of research by the United Nations, which would have been discovered by the United States and the United States.
With the oversight of BGI's founder Wang Xian and taking five days, the model is seen in the model that if the ability to examine it is not started, the number of cases would be 47% higher and the cost of dealing with the contractant would be double.
Wuhan Labrates have been followed immediately in all 12 cities throughout China by the Huo-John Labrei experiments.
By 420, the entire daily transport capacity was tested every day. The frames of several open sources used by Orgamy Ess were released each day using 93 tests that can be checked to the pattern of the COVID of more than 112 diseases of the COVIDE. These measures can be carried out without the need of a biocarquivaler.
Before March, there was a problem testing large levels of work-ups in EU, UK and US.
This prompted some authors to locate the evidence for creating a sample of the RNA Gnom that would include heating samples for 5 minutes to determine the next test. March 31 was announced that the United Arab Mirrors were now going to investigate more of their population than any other person's population.
The ability to check the drive-throuse and Group 42 and BGI (in China) was due to the fact that they were using their "Hoo-Yan" time-based technology.
In 14 days, the university is able to investigate thousands of RT-PR daily each day, and the world is the first to work out such a large level outside China.
Different research methods of the Coronnavos Zenavier have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has taken up the German strategy to develop low-reference countries that are undependable in resources.
Germany’s Constitution was published on January 1720; the protocol developed by St. D. D. D. D.S. was not available until January 28 of the United States's Department of Investigation was released on the availability of tests in U.S.... The experiments between China and the United States, and the United States, which did not have enough to meet the needs of the United States's experts.
On the contrary, experts say that the widespread availability of the investigations in South Korea helped reduce the flow of Nowell Coornavas.
Check capacity, especially in private areas, has been developed over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that the best way to increase investigation programs is to slow down the increased impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. Because of the increased demand for the spread of virus levels in the U.S. schools, the use of thousands of cases in the U.S. companies has become a problem.
In March 2020, China indicated the problem of balance in its checks kits.
In the United States, it was developed by CDC; then the government removed the labor obstacles that prevented personal investigation, and Spain checked from the Chinese for private investigation from Chinese forums, but the results were not realistic.
Farm said the wrong results could be due to failure to gather the samples or to use them properly.
The Ministry of Spain said that he would remove the pieces that would be wrong and replace by another check published by Shanjan biogime, who was purchased from China by China. The Czech Republic took the wrong results from China.
The Prime Minister Mattov suggested that they should put them in Deb. A Kate and Karra from Turkey's health minister said that the "high error rate" was bought by China by China and he did not use them.
After the investigation, those who were interviewed were able to find the contraction and those who were in contact with Western SARS-COV-2 people who had received positive results.
Since the location of the first COVID-19, researchers working in Warsaw, Italy, have twice examined the entire population of 3,400 people at the end of nearly ten days.
About half of those who were involved had no symptoms, and all investigations were confiscated.
The new transition was completely completed by the travel ban on the arrival site.
It is easy to expect other developed countries to be able to locate contacts, check, check, check, check, check, and check, but rather than resurgently shutting down restaurants and self-communion restrictions, without stopping other growth countries in Singapore.
Several programs have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun to advise the residents to stay home from March 28, but on March 23 after a college accident.
Other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed to locate contacts directly by preventing internal travel, testing and contingency, but by reducing the epidemic by lower-term lockdown.
Statistics show that the death rate of cases in countries where the number of deaths has been tested is very low, probably because these countries are more capable of identifying those who are not aware of them.
WHO suggests that they do not have the ability to check the country and that national companies have limited experience on COVID-19, send one of their first five keys to investigate their first five points of WHO and first ten references by WHO references from the 16 contextrs of WHO.
7 of the 16 reference experts in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the list below, the page 's %d of Panic 's" is affected by the checking policy of the column.
As is the case with other things, a country where only the hospital is checked, there will be more than one percent of the government's tests in the country where all citizens are tested, even if they are shown signs.
Washing hands (or handwashing), also known as the washing of hands, is a job to clean your hands with the purpose of removing waste, oil, minerals, minerals, or other essential items.
During a day, the constant washing of hands on the "superibilities" prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, teeth and ja, which communicates with the main route.
People can also be infected with the flu or common conditions, for example, if they don’t wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or arms.
Five important moments of washing hands from soap during the day are important: before and after breakfast or after changing the number of fingers, before eating or after feeding the child, before eating or preparing food, before eating or after eating, or after eating.
If water and soap are not available, hand washing can be cleaned from ashes. The World Health Organization allows to wash hands at the following times:
Before preparing food, during and after.
Before and later before taking care of the sick.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the baby using the toilet.
After touching your nose, cutting or scraping your nose.
After the beast, the beast, or the beast touch the forbidden thing.
The cleanliness of medical hand refers to cleanliness related to medical procedures related to medical procedures.

In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a kind of worry have less chances to be involved in other "superi" activities such as volunteer activities.
Religion counsels to wash hands for both cleanliness and symbolic purposes. To wash hands without touching hands with soapy water, Hindu religion, Hindu religion in Judaism and Neatil Yedam, Christendom, and Islam are a part of the practice of washing hands in various religions.
It is necessary to wash hands after using a toilet in Hindu religion, Judaism, and Islam.
And it is necessary to wash hands before eating, before eating, and after eating in Hindu religion.
The risk of spreading COVID-19 infection on the job
To prevent the dangers of the COVID-19 invasion at the workplace, the Coornavas disease has been used for the hindered 2019 (COVID–1919) of the use of professional security and health personnel to control the dangers.
Depending on the proper control, work, and work on the risk of spreading disease on the workplace, the risk value of contact sources, the seriousness of disease in the community, and the risk of individual employees who are seriously infected by the COVID-19-19 infection.
According to American commercial security and health administration (OSHA), less contact with people and other colleagues in low - risk activities with people and fellow workers is allowed to seek basic insurance measures, including: washing hands, keeping hands in the home if they are sick, and doing household chores.
The middle contact risk is for those who need to make repeated and close contact with people who do not know or doubt or doubt about the transition, but who can be infected because of ongoing social transmission or international travel.
It includes workers who are contacted by the general public, such as college, high-degree work environment, and some high-ranking sales.
In addition to basic transmission measures, this group includes the measures of safety measures: using air filter with high - high - security guard, and maintaining personal security for that condition if you have to cope with a person who has to face the underlying issue.
OSHA considers those health workers and women who come to contact COVID-19 in contact with the infected person, and this is a high risk of high contact if the workers are high-accused or committed to high blood pressure.
In the control of these workers, effective personal security tools are included for a negative amount of safety facilities and tasks, such as the government's control of the Internet.
The COVID-19 may have a lot of effects within the office.
Work may be useless from fear of getting sick, caring for others, or fear of having potential contacts.
What items are required, and these tools can change the nature of business in relation to both time and time of demand (such as time or delivery via delivery or travel services).
In the end, the flow of objects from the COVID-19 to seriously affected areas can be affected. The use of prepared and response plan can be directed to health measures.
Plans address the risk levels associated with various jobs and jobs, including risking risk factors from the source of safety, home and social systems, as well as the risk of old or old medical conditions, such as personal circumstances.
They also point out the urgent plans for control and circumstances that may result in the consequences.
Preparation and response plans can be under national or national interests.
The goal of the response to one curse is: lower shift between workers, protect the high health risks, maintain business operations, and lower the effects of other units in their performances.
In the business community, the seriousness of the disease is affected by the serious reactions of the disease.
The sequence of dangers is a structure that is widely used to create a group of dangers according to commercial security and impact in health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be finished, the most effective control control is then under administrative control and finally personal security tools.
The engineering control involves separating workers without depending on the actions of workers involved in working on jobs, and applying it can be the most serious solution to the process.
Admin control policy has changes policy or processes that require action by the user or employer.
Personal security device (PE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain contacts.
Works must be selected on all types of PPPE based on the risks, properly positioned (e.g., breathing machine), constant and well-dressed, regular surveillance, maintenance, and correct-reference required, clean, clean, and preventing from storage or storage.
According to American commercial security and health administration (OSHA), there is a minimum commercial contact with people and other colleagues in less risky activities.
All workers are involved in the synthesis: repeatedly and properly wash the hands, encourage workers to stay at home if they are sick, scrubbing, and scraping the masks, provided to provide the toilet and toilets, if necessary, and the repercussion of work.
The quick identification and retrospecting of potential infected people on the workplace is an important step for workers, clients, visitors, visitors and others.
The American Disease Control and Prevention Center suggests that employees who have severe fever symptoms are at home until they are at least 24 hours out of fever or other symptoms of fever, fever, or any other symptoms of fever, or any other symptoms from fever, fever, or any other symptoms that are allowed to stay with the family who are in these jobs.
According to OSHA, the medium-equivocal activities include the activities of those who need to be repeated or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters), with people who do not know or have a close contact between COVID-19, or doubt suspect, but are caused by a community-of-VAR2, which can be committed by SVV2, or by the recent internationalization of the International Union.
These include a Web-based search engine that is connected to a general population, such as the high-level job environment, and some high-level consumers. Establish high-end security filters for this and high-end security systems. Establishing high-spots, send-offs, send-off water-for-to-source clients to the home, provide a secure job to secure the home and home-to-do-to-do-me-to-to-do-mes, allowing a search program to be set up with a useful job, a searchor-to-ursor-to-to-ursor-to-ursor-to-do-ursor-ursor-mes-to-regor-to-to-regor-ursor-regor-to-ursor-regor-regency, provide a useful job to repair, preventable resource, preventive, preventive, preventive, allowing the operation of preventive, preventive, including preventive, preventive, preventive, and counter-to-to-to-ursor-ursor-to-ursor-ursor-ursor-to-to-recursor.
In this risk group, workers need to use rare breathing.
If a person gets sick on a plane, he and others are involved in proper control of the safety of employees and others: remove the sick person from 6 feet [6 feet] to 6 feet [6 m], to name a driver who is sick for service, to give a sick person a smile or a mask or to cover a sick person with his face or his nose.
The driver must put on essential medical medications to care for the sick passengers or perhaps the body’s toxic wastes, and if the sufferer is difficult to eat, or breathe, possible personal security equipment should be put on.
One of the other essential objects should be handled in the biogemedard bag, and the damaged resources should be cleaned and removed later. Cruzi ships and other ships should be served on the control of traffic ship, travel and transport, and transporting and transporting ships and transporting ships to the control of danger - if there are any other signs of the ships or ships.
Naturally, medical procedures should be handled in the cell of a man who is injured. For university and child care, allows the CDC to clean or close the CDC if any infected person has been in a hospital house without a infected person.
When middle-science is moderately shared, social isolation can be applied, such as field trips, meetings, and other large meetings such as physical education or singing programs, adjusting distance between the desks and the times of vacations, limiting the time of the fire and the fires, and preventing food from the office.
When there is enough communication in the local community, social isolation can be considered on the extended college vacations. For regular legal procedures doing daily laws, immediately health risks are considered by the CDC.
Law behavior authorities who have to contact COVID-19 are urged to follow the directions of emergency medical technology with proper personal security equipment.
If there is a close contact during capture, the workers should use their double belts and tools before they reuse their device, using home-suppikes or pieces, and implementing the standard process for the removal and maintenance of the PEEE.
OSHA considers some health care and death-house workers to be in high or high degrees of risk or high levels of risk.
High-dependence measures include providing health care, helping, labs and medical transport workers who come to contact known COVID-19 or serious diseases.
These are very high contacts risking if workers unite or organize or organize an Erosolic process on known diseases, known as COVID-19.
Aerosol generates processes include neutron access, fincoscope process, test and test tests, or symmetrical processes.
High-criminal activities include people who prepare the bodies of known people or those who are known by COVID-19 during their death; if they examine the body of dead bodies, they become very high-ustrators. In addition to these risk groups, there are anti-posimilators, anti-postices, anti-posing cells, or cells.
Some health care and ads may be appropriate.
Samples should be handled with three caution.
The World Health Organization suggests that the coming diseases are dependent on whether they are a sensitive COVID-19 case, apart from different waiting periods. Other OSHA advocates for those who have been infected with SARC-2-2 diseases or infections within SARV2.
In the United States, NIOSH allowed N95 filtering sensors should be used in context of the written visual security program, training, training and medical testing.
Other types of breathing can provide more protection and improve the rest of the workers. WHO Carverlos does not seek the approval of the COVID-19 instead of being transmitted through physical chemicals.
WHO recommends only one scientific mask for the screening workers at the location.
For those who have no antisocial processes that are involved with the syllables of the COVID-19 patients, who are taking care of them, WHO urges a surgeon mask, Google's face, chimpels, chimps and desol.
If someone is generated by an Aerosol, the electric mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 sensors.
In view of PEEE's global presence, WHO Telepathys, like the physical obstacles, allowing people to enter a room with only a COVID-19 disease in direct care, only one who only needs to use the PPE without the care of multiple diseases, and the need to use the power of the PEPP, and the need to use monitors, and use the limited resources of the PEPP, the ability to use it.

This month is unusual circumstances around us.
The COVID-19 has made clear our responsibilities toward all mankind and our responsibilities toward each other.
Its challenges are unique to us, but we must know that our best response is global equality, cooperation, and community growth, which is in the center of this organization.
The length of the circle of the e-mails we have seen between all our colleagues on the calls, calls and chat shows remarkablely how much we have had the privilege of working with extraordinary people.
I'm so grateful and proud that you're able to tell all of you as colleagues.
Last week, a person shared the praise of our work with me.
He reminded me how important it is to turn towards Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is to be available online and available for all.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the site on or our fellow workers or keep our community safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now the most needed.
It's a moment in which our work, our way of doing it, and our way of doing it, both will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of this mission, and because of your role, we are going to make some remarkable changes in the way we work with us through this fire week.
Changes in Our Work and Times
As Robin noted earlier, C-Tim met the past night to create a time-time schedule for our system and the next days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the right response to our situation, and the best way to maintain the organization's continued existence during that time.
We were spirit and we wanted to eliminate stress and cooperate with our mission for a long time.
It's not wrong if you lose your job.
For all staff, contractor, and contract workers:
Our daily tasks are expected to be nearly 4 hours a day, or 20 hours per week.
We're not announcing holiday - if you're able to do more than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is not here at this time, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, bring the rent, or go to the doctor, your skill is our priority.
We're not counting your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
No need to say it, but we're saying it.
There is no need for any sickness or POO - just tell your manager and help your team in research of calendar and schedules so that you can be sure that the main area of work will take a look at no-coa.
(if you have been confirmed to be COVID-19, please tell the Bren of TURM; PCs to help you and make sure that your situation is useful from management.)
The hours workers will get full pay.
We've already said, and we're republished once again to fulfill our promises to our contractors and staff.
Each person will receive payment for his normal work hours during normal circumstances.
If you're sick and you can't do work, you'll get paid.
If you want to work, we're with you.
Many people use their jobs as a way to get out of the world that is around them.
What we can do may be very satisfying, especially at such times.
Once again, you take care of yourself.
Let's say you talk to your manager, so that we know what to expect, and then we can do the same.
Some things are considered essential.
There are some things we can't give up.
SRE, HR ops, trust and security, and donations (Others) work very well-communicated jobs that may need extra assistance.
We'll start a process with all the categories for the current purposes and our attention to focus on our mission to support vital things for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we'll just focus on the most necessary projects.
By reducing the speed right now, we'll survive later.
There is no plan to double our "two times for profit" after going to the global epidemic.
Now you won't expect to work extra hours for the completion of the last time-limits.
We believe things have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and schedules where appropriate.
What will happen to APP (audience)?
Our new reality and daily work to balance the expectations of hours, we want to switch back to our 2020-2021 annual plan to meet our 2020-21 annual plan.
Our intention is to offer an extended application for our 2019-2020 plan to make a budget so that the workers can give their excessive job, care, and care of loved ones, and those who need to adjust to the schedule of the fire-ups.
This expansion of time-Cima will slow down our current efforts and pressure in the entire organization.
We will put our offer in front of the director’s congregation next week and make sure we get confirmation that we will inform representatives and team about the following steps.
Thank you for your APP Team for your leadership.
Position of office, contacts, and cleanup
Last week, we learned that a SF-based partner of ours may have come to contact COVID-19 virus.
However, with much caution, we transferred to the anti-terrorial health agency to disrupt all the resources of the San Francisco office.
He introduced the bank of the hospital-grade horse every day, Labi, and the Elytra Bank that came to our camp.
Using the safety of his residents in the building, their own care protocol is being applied to help them.
We believe the office will be fully ready when we return.
Our DC office is located in VARC, which has shared with our COVID-19 protocol and all the staff members at the DCC.
Last week, our DC office called for a complete distance system in accord with the direction that is shared by Francisco.
As we know some NYC-based colleagues, there is also a discussion of taking a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from house to house for the first time.
Our colleagues working long and hard from home know that it must be done, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the meetings' time to more than one or two hours to the elderly.
If necessary, consider them one day.
Define meetings clearly, prepare and send the reading content first.
To make live cooperation and communication flow, make videos your default choice with the help of Google Docs and Zoom tools like Google Docs and Zoom.
To make each meeting a advantage, make sure a person watches over a chat and account of the conversation list, and help a person take notes (or notes with mutual assistance)
Send email to the site if you want relaxing headheads.
Use your health commitment to minimize.
Join the #remotis channel to talk to your colleagues about the distribution work.
The HR Operas team is testing webinar-based service instructions to cooperate in the distribution work.
This past week, we told all the books we received from the public programs distributed by Wikipedia, such as Editantend, until WHO announced the end of global plague.
We told them that we understood that it could be impossible to meet their mutually-reference initiatives and other restrictions, and that no one would be punished for delays or researching them.
In this round week, we will follow additional instructions in connection with Macedonia and other territory and the public assembly.
This barrier has caused suffering throughout the global community, but it also has a sense of relief to focus on their own communities, on Vietnam, and elsewhere.
Moving forward, monitoring effects and providing a place for the community to provide a place for the community to follow our communication with them.
Keeping contact with COVID-19 about issues
We will send an invitation to your next Thursday, 14:00/07:00 pT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend a little time together.
We're together in this situation and there's something to help.
In the meantime, you can continue searching information from this email on the office V, and all the other required COVID-19.
CRT will keep these pages and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with workers living in the affected countries at this time.
If you need to ask something about traveling, programs, a major process, or some other matter on which you need help, please indicate CRT and work with it.
We are available to help provide help and establish the connection as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send an email to the Director of the HR International Global Program Minister Brian Jeden.
None of these changes should be seen as our work and our rights.
Rather, they agree that at this time our work and our rights need to be adjusted as we have never done in the past.
We believe these steps are needed to help one another so that we can work, provide our activities with their needs, and continue serving the world that depends on the service that the world puts.
Our plans will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Currently, this time is to help one another, and the fire weeks and perhaps perhaps the most important actions in the fire month.
We need you all to make it possible, and so we want you all to take care of yourself and your families, so that you can be on your best level when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Anesthesiary anesthesiology 2 (ACE2) is the outer synthesis of fibrous, heart, kidneys, and heart and organs.
ACE2 ENI decreases the amount of insulin-II and balances the activity of the anti-international agency, which makes it a promising target for treatment of heart disease. AC2 also works in the gates.
The human version of the engine is often referred to as hACE2.
Anti-cension-deductive anim 2 finally and in the surface of other cells is a merging funonium.
AEC2 protein contains N-Turminal Patriots M2 Domain and C-C-Turminal Victrone-Micronomic Commons Domain Domains.
AEC2 FIF2 is the type of IJI protocol with an un-registered algorithm on the surface of cells and other computers.
AEC2's external domain is separated from other social domains, and resulting in a rising protein flow free of blood and eventually is released in the waste.
AECE2 is present in most parts: AECE2 is the primary form of fictital cells, such as II Airkote cells, a small fraction of the diameter of the skin and the end of the stroke of the skin within most parts.
ACE2 mNA appearances are also found in the Vulpecula, Strategic, Hepethium, and the brain column.
AECE2's primary job is to work as a cover of ACE.
AECE Angelines I organizes the carriers in the motorcycgens II.
ACE2 Again breathes carbonist Esp2 (Ap-Arg-Aerg-Tyr-Es-H-P) from carbon al-Porro-Po-Po-Pi) and it rotates carbon-Eid estonin (H-A-A-A-A-H-A-H-H-H-A-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-P) in the air.
ACE2 [de-Arg9] -Breakin, Epilin, Newton, Darwin, Dinforfinin A and Green may also be divided by several other pilots.
The ACE2 non-communicator SC6AA is also controlling the Zelyley Transportation and its role in the heart attack.
As a parasol process, the ACV2, HCL3; SS-COV (SARS-COS); and SS-COV-COV2 (CVD-2), works in the main entrances to some cells, including some of the cells that produceCVID-19.
More particularly, SARS-COV and SARS-CV2's Contract with S1prouts2's ENS2's ENS2's unit is the location of AAC2's acids and espressosos in Andreassoms and emesium.
This entry requires the production of TPMS2 to trigger SRS2, which is in the current testing as a potential medical test. This has led some people to suggest that a low level of the AC2 levels in the cells can help combat the infection.
However, many professional organizations and the firms have recommended to continue the standard ACE and ARB medicine.
On July 11, 2012, a series of reviews and meta-e-encommunicative reviews published on the subject were found: "The use of the ACE resistances was linked to a 34% significant reduction in the threat of pneumonia."
Also, "AACE has also reduced the risk of Nomonia in the patients who were in the high risk of pneumonia, especially those who were injured and heart failure.
The use of AC resistances was also connected to a low rate of death rate related to Nimonia, although the results were less powerful than the risk of compared to the risk of Armenia."
The reimburse human AACE2 (ArCE2) was considered new medicine for the severe loss of fiblixes, and was about to be reformed in the lungs of the Lipiscosia-based superfluous airdreed children at Syropommeme syndrome and oxygen.
The human population has about 10 hours of RHACE2 and the beginning of the operation with 24 hours of operation with the effect of the operation (international) is 30 minutes.
Many conclusions suggest that the rahAC2 excellent reintinents may have a positive drug for non-registers (RAS resistances) or such diseases may increase in the parageninetic I.
COVID-19 is a mobile software application which has been designed to help in response to the 2019–20 Correspondence epidemic in response to the outbreak of the Great Depression, that is, to help.
Many applications were developed or proposed with official assistance in certain areas and in judicial areas.
Several stages have been developed to build contact tracking applications.
The anxiety of privacy has been raised, especially about the tools that are based on the tracking of AP user's geographic situation.
In low-interactive options, the use of Bluetooth signals to log out from another user's cellphones to log out.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would unite the ability to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has planned an app in the cooperation of Alipay, which allows citizens to investigate whether they are in contact with people who are COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as an open source, and it will be handed to the government. Nathan Macedonia has probably identified the contact with infected individuals and has launched a Bluetooth-based "Spocker."
Ap was developed by the Communication and Technology Ministry and Health Ministry.
By April 14, 2020, it was waiting to be approved by Google Play and Apple Apple Stere.
On April 12, the government said that contact training was in an advanced phase of development, and plans will be available within weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the Traither app and the BlueTetra protocol. COVID-19 for the victims who live in Russia, who are designed to make sure that they don't get out of the house.
Ros Anderson, professor of security engineers at the Cambridge University of Cambridge listed several potential practical problems with the app-based systems, including wrong plastic issues and the use of apps to limit the possibility of a small portion of the population.
Addressing anxiety about the spread of pornography, Apple defined only "privileged" or other respected organizations to which the organization can include the apps associated with coorvisation in its app.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Security activists have expressed their concern about the identity of the safety of the so-called Cooranavier apps, especially about whether the safety measures made to deal with the disease will be destroyed after this danger.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for this kind of oversight.
The organizations announced eight conditions on government projects:
The watchman must be "prepared, needed, and equal."
A comparison must be cut for the regions of observation and oversight;
The data should be used to COVID-19 for purposes;
Data security and privacy must be protected and displayed on evidence;
The digital watchman should avoid promoting prejudice and injustice;
Any share of data with third parties should be defined in law;
For response to abuse and abuse of abuse, citizens should have the protection of the rights of citizens;
All "real Shares" by public health experts and non-profit groups, including the German Caos computer club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
The purpose of the proposed Google / Apple scheme, when it is not needed, is to remove their device operating system from the operating system and handle the problem regularly.
Some countries used network-basedization tracking instead of reducing both the capacity to download and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was suspended.
Network-based solutions to which there are no non-registered location data, there are major problems with privacy problems.
Although not all systems on the central server require personal location data; many privacy-related systems have been created using the central server (see the link).
A non-profit system was used to train contact in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system united track information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, and they likely have been able to generate notification by text messages.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government has also made information available public due to the privacy of the country after the MERS's president.
This information is available to people through several applications and websites. Many countries including Germany considered using central and privacy systems.
By April 6, 2020, these details have not been issued yet.
Since at least one large firm of research publications from 2013 is a well-discovered connection. By April 20, 2020, more expert groups were working on privacy-uncial solutions such as Bluetooth to get closer to the other users' cellphones.
Although PPPP-PT is a parallel-person with both central and twisted methods, and this is no protocol. Distortive protocol has no protocol. Distortical privacy training (D-PTP/PTP3), communications (CDPT, NEPT), communications, and privacy communications (CPPN, CP) are associated with the CPPPP, CTP, and other communications for communications and other communications.
In these protocols, the identityable private data device never goes out, and all matches are on the device.
The MIT media collection has developed a platform to use the location or path copy data to cover the COVID-19's media.
This is based on the discovery of the "Apps Gong: Maintenance-Primsy" by the company Enigma MP, which was originally established in the MIT media.
Safate uses secure hardware technology, which allows users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the data.
On April 5, 2020, global TCN collection was established by groups that were directly organized in context of similar views and a large scale, with the goal of reducing the progress of training and warnings, and an important aspect of the global observance of training and warning apps, which was to be able to acquire extensive adaptation.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that he has released the BlueTranes protocol used by his official government app.
On April 10, 2020, companies that handle Google and Apple, Andrew and IOS mobile platforms, announced an aspect of communicating training, which he claimed that this Bluetooth will protect the security of the following energy technology and privacy technology.
He also published foreigns of major techs used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is scheduled to be available in three steps:
Make tools available to the governments to enable governments to create legal privacy-supporting aerospace tracking app
Equivalent in iOS and Android of this performance
