Roberto Kalzadilla, one of Bolivia's president, said that Bolivia has power, unity, and a spirit of self-sensibility, and hopes to achieve positive views.
The decision of ICJ across the country in many parts of Bolivia will be seen on large screens across the country, hoping that Hitler will decide in the case of the Hybria Bollya Bollywoodian Bolivia that after several years of the Communist regime's actions to make it their way to the sea.
Mr. Evo Muralis, who is an atheist in Bolivia, also has to make a lot of room for the decision of Monday.
He expressed his determination in August that their country is nearly close to the Pacific Ocean.
But some researchers think that the court will not be judged in the case of Bolivia - and if so, it will not change.
The UN has no right to place the country's territory in the country's court, and he has claimed that he will not determine the outcome of possible religions.
In an international law, the fact that ICJ's decision is being made only six months after the last hearing of the funeral shows that the case was not "incite"
Rather than promote Bolivia’s goal, it might have been the last four years that have affected it.
Gata said that the current administration of Bolivia has made the problem of access to the sea.
He said that the debate with Mauritius has ended the rest of the goods of the next.
Bolivia and the past can continue talking, but then it will be very difficult to practice religion.
Both countries have not changed since 1962.
The former president Edward Rodríguez, who is represented by Bolivia in Hague, has rejected the idea that the court's decision action was illegal.
He's an extraordinary opportunity to start a new phase of relationship with Bolivia on Monday and end up in 139 years of frustration for each other’s goods.
Carlisla denied that Morley, who is still one of the most popular Europeans in Latin America, is using the ocean problem as a political wizard.
He said that he would never compromise his right to reach the Pacific.
The judge's decision is an opportunity to highlight the need to forget the past.
Northern Korea: Antiquities Without Confidence in America

Ray said that it is the idea that the bans will force the U.S. government to push North Korea to shrink the North Korea.
Washington Pong has been careful not to announce it without any mention of the armed actions of the armed forces.
At least and the United States President Donald Trump wants to meet both other seniors.
But there is a wide doubt that Pong Hong Kong is a serious concern about deciding in an armed conflict that he considers to be the only guarantee of his peace.

John Edward: Skillful Language Skills for Global Citizens
The record of the independent school of freedom school, and the record continued with excellent test results in 2018, which has been built to strengthen the community's initiative in sports, music, music, and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, the school represented by the Scottish Council of Education (SCIS) is trying to provide the best level of service to the students and parents.
Free school prepares its students for their next and higher education, their chosen careers and world citizens.
As part of education designed and applied, we are seeing modern languages inside schools as a popular and popular article.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language that he thinks he is, he's in his head.
If you talk to someone in your language, she's drawn into his heart.
It is a reminder that we cannot only rely on English in terms of relationships and trust from other countries.
With the results of this year's recent test, we can see that the language in free school is the top of the League's calls.
As a whole, 68 percent of those who read foreign languages were earned by HYDA.
The 74 members of the SCIS were gathered from schools, showing that 72 percent of the students received HDA in Madrid, while 72 percent of the German readers read, 69 percent of French readers and 63 percent of the Spanish read.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland contribute to important skills as foreign languages that children and young people need in the future.
As the article in independent schools and other places, languages are now the same position as the SEM articles (Sys, technology engineering and math).
In 2014, a survey from the U.S. committees in the United States revealed that 17 percent of the languages have been reduced to a low level of language skills for the problems of non-profits.
So the skills of language skills to prepare young people for the career of their future.
As the language is being needed for more work opportunities, these skills have become necessary in today’s world.
Regardless of career, if anyone learns another language, they will benefit in the future with the skills of that kind of life.
Having been able to speak directly to people from foreign countries, Haidi puts ahead of a rich man.
Yuguov Paul, in 2013, was a survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language, and French is the only language spoken by 15 percent.
That's why it's important for today's children to learn language.
Several languages, as a particular development industry, increase the chances of finding good employment for children.
Inside Scotland, every school is read in different languages.
A number of schools focus on more modern languages, while others teach the languages that have been the most important idea for Britain by 2020, such as Myanmar or Japan.
Any of your child's likes, free schools will always be available, and the teacher will be trained in this field.
Scottish free schools are trying to provide educational environments that prepare and prepare children for future success.
In the global business environment of this time, language is very important to the future of the country, so it should be in practice.
Of course, modern languages should be viewed as "interference international skills".
This choice will continue for independent school students in Scotland.

On walking that day, Jordan Sippy said that they had six-points, and now they've been left four, so I think we're taking it as a little bit of an act of action.
Of course, Europe has been exalted, with four points ahead, when they can try to get the bar further.

North Korea says without confidence "not being born" is simply non-communicated.
On the weekend of North Korea, the United Nations told the United Nations that their country is experiencing the trust of the United States, and in such circumstances, their country would not have been questioned that their country was suddenly armed with nuclear weapons.
Rong Ho pointed out that North Korea has taken steps to "the last few years", such as the U.S. Segilization of the Etme and Mejal Test, to end the Etimate Institute and prevent the spread of the Internet and Internet technology."
He said, but we don't see how he reacts from America.
Our national security will be untrustworthy without trusting in the United States, and in any case, we will not be easily armed at all.
While Rizf Affifi Ammi reiterated the criticisms of the Saudi Koreans regarding the "Mushting War" activism, it appears that they did not hesitate to reject the anti-Shahtans as if they were in the past.
Ree on June 12, the US president of the United States and the leader of North Korea, who went through the first meeting with them, referred to the "corruption" following the first meeting of the president of North Korea, which I promised to try to clean up the "corruption region" when he promised the peace of the Soviet Union.
North Korea wanted to end the Korean War 53–50, but the United States said Pung Ying would have to deplete its military weapon first.
Washington also resisted harsh international restrictions on North Korea.
Ray says, the U.S. insists on "the first half-at-extremeition" and in a general way increase pressure by restrictions for its purpose and says that "the end of the war is also at stake."
The idea that bans can force us to sneez up on the knee is one of those people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that restrictions are extending confidence.
Ray has never mentioned the plans for the second president of the United States to meet in the United States before.
Instead, the judge specifically mentioned three visits between me and the leader of South Korea in the last five months and added: “If the case was not a fictitious South Asian issue in the United States, it would not have been such a form of defense.”
Nevertheless, the rise of Ray's speech was quite different from the last year's speech, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that "Mr. Satan's president" on the Trump of the North Korean Revolution, after he declared that the U.S. government had been built with the U.S. government in the United States.
Trump, who warned North Korea to “register” in the last year of the United Nations, praised the steps taken by the United Nations, but said that there is still much more work to be done and that the U.S. government should be banned by the North Koreans.
In the middle, Trump said that he doesn't have the time frame, it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.
China and Russia have the idea that the United Nations should pay tribute for the efforts of the United Nations Peace Council.
However, the U.S. Secretary-C.P.P. told the United Nations Peace Council to gather the conference saying: “The bans of the Peace College must continue until we have reached the complete, complete, and accurate fire-at-prevatation mission.”
Peace council has also added to the criticisms on the North Korea opinion of the Pyong-King app and the anti-Baling programs since 2006.
Pimppoo met with Rere with the United Nations General Assembly and then told them that they would visit Pong Ying for the next month.
The pope has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been good.
When they left Pong Young in July, they said they had been released but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned them for "drinking like dogs."
North Korea promised to end an emergency with me in a meeting with me this month if the United States adopted the United States-based "constitutions".
He told them that the "constitution" is the "conclusive" that those who wanted security are the ones who had promised the Trump promised and included steps to restore contact with Washington.
Share in a sufficient amount of sleep in the Harvard School
The Harvard University has inspired all its graduates under a new course to take more sleep in order to cope with the growing tendency of a man - with the help of Kafien.
One student learned that students at the University of the World's First Number are often unaware of how to be treated as they are most basicly.
Professor of Dreaming Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a Specialist Charles Celsler in Brahma and Vamenens Hospital in Hepatial, which says that this is the first course in his career in the United States.
After a talk on the lack of sleep on the reading process, they were moved to start the course.
He told the official graph that when she was finished, she came to me and said, ‘Why am I telling this about when I'm in my senior year?’
He told me that no one ever told him the importance of sleep - a fact that made me wonder.
The course that started this year's first year shows how to help sleep habits and sports activities and also improve their general tastes.
Paul Berry, director of mental health services at Harvard Medical School and university, said that after finding out that the students are very tired during the week, the students decided to organize the course.
The whole course includes a series of intersects.
In one series, a picture of the hospital room, including the influence of the students and the effect of light and light and how it affects the lack of sleep and the lack of sleep and the lack of sleep and the lack of sleep and the ability to learn about the importance of gold habits, arts, and books.
In another series, participants are told how long sleepless heartless heart loss increases the risk of strokes, tyrks, and cancers.
A map of the campus with parallel records encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
Paul Sesleur further said, we know that this won't change the attitude of the students immediately.
But we realize that they have the right to know - just like you have to know about the consequences of smoking while choosing a cigarette.
He said that the tradition of feeling proud of being awake at night is still growing up and saying that today's new technology and constant pressure is a problem.
He said that you sleep a lot of good sleep in a lot of stress, fatigue and anxiety, should be a secret weapon to avoid the lack of sleep because sleep causes the brain to fall into hunger, which they often feel hungry.
A 19-year-old student, Ramd So, who is learning chemical and medical biochemistry, has helped Professor Paul Celsler to prepare courses, before he took one of them during his first year in Harvard.
She told the course that she opened her eyes and brought peace to her trying to start a course in the camp.
He hopes to complete this kind of education program before all post-registration students join in the Revolution Organization.
Professor Sessler has recommended that the students should consider when and when to go to bed and watch when they have to be distracted and have to warn about the effects of electronic light coming out of electric light, this light can cause sleep in the night change.
Victory from a zero at Löpington's Ranger: Megan killed Gerard's athletes
Reinergers was another disturbing when a multiple of the Dolly Ming beat Stephen Gerard's unconstitutional team against a zero against a zero in Lingston.
Iberx's team was searching to record his first winning in France after 4th successful in February, but Gary Holt's team took his second defeat on 18 games as well as his team threw him on 18 games, and his team received an eight letter from the Lady Garder.
Megan opened seven minutes ago and found it never boring.
While the Rangers are now on the sixth number, Liangston has set a mark on the third number and only behind the difference from the Hungarian.
There may be more problems for Gerard when the line was apparently damaged by throwing something other than the other one.
Gerhard made eight changes in his team, which led to the Irr Batford's simulators.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same LV 11 who gave a point from the Harts last week's Hart, and it's going to be happy with it, in a way that it's all the way back there.
It may be that the Rangers are able to remain, but Leonington put the ball in his control.
They only found out within two minutes when the first time I started playing the game, Stut Pitt Pitman gave the ball in the ball, but the Madifer saved it at the time.
By the distance of the Kyung Jacobs, the Franks had reached Kreg Haletttt, but their defense party members found Elthego Gala to be just a bank post.
Rangers could find control on the game, but in the final third part, they could only be expected to be sure of their games.
Alfred Moreaulos felt that he found the penetration on the fourth watch when he was attacked between him and Steven Lells, but Referen Steamson rejected the voices of the people of Colombia.
Rangers had only two shots at Haifa's first shot, but Alex's ex-gil paper was not having any trouble with Lazula's head and the weakest white shirt.
While Livi could have been against the open game in 34 minutes, no one could deny that it was their first priority.
Once again the Rangers failed to mix with Jacobs' strategy.
Could not respond to the time-old Artificial response when Dillan threw the Gavin Scott Rabbson to the Roneson and decided to stop his trick.
During the dedication, Gerard changed his position in Colombia, and the change showed some immediate effect when he sang the Marilous, but the majority ran out of his time to stop him.
But Lexton continued to force guests to play their own game when Lithgo and Hakht were standing long shots.
Holt's team could have increased in its lead at the last moment when Lithgy was thrown to the decks, but Max Greggor came in the way and failed their efforts.
Glenn Mudalton, an associate of Rangers, claimed that he had a penetration with Jacqueline but ignored it.
BRAZIL: The position of the Geig plant
And now a page from the "day's Eve's Eve's House: Numbers 136 years before today, September 30, 18782, created by future expert Jenun Weil in Germany.
Gagar prepared a way to publish and republished the news, which was a product that eventually led to the name of the Gagator.
It's not only science since then but also the Pope’s novel, such as in the 1950 "Bass of Corndo", which appears in the 1950 "Braz of Cordondo", which appears to have seemingly undisclosed scientific opinion and data service:
What is it?
Rogers: "It's the guitar factory, which is used to wear a uniform.
When you do this, you can really hear the effects of the acids produced in the world."
Eunes: "Yes, it's definitely pop!"
"Hanse" Gagar died a few days before his 63th anniversary in 1945.
But his name is still alive.
A cancer’s new vaccine can train the immune system to “the vision ”
A cancer’s new vaccine can train the immune system to ‘ see ’ and kill the cells

Professor Brzeffkin observed that the HAR2 "is due to a cancer of cancer" including Daniel, Daniel, and Dr. Berzevsky.
The same kind of wisdom that has succeeded in treating patients with drug abuse and getting cancer patients to the hospital.

Traditionally, some parts of China spread rapidly through the HIV virus's spread through blood transfusions.
However, in a conference in Greece, Chinese medical officials reported that the number of people affected by HIV has dropped to nearly zero.
Over the years, however, the number of HIV and AIDS cases in China has reached 100,000.
Moving HIV through sexual relations is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
In China in 1997, homosexuality was considered unconstitutional, but it is said that the differences between the LGBT people are still common.
Because of the country's harsh values, Steadys has estimated that 70-90 percent of men who have sexual relations with men are finally married to women.
Most of these cases are due to illegal sexual protection in such relationships.
To solve the problem, China's government has promised the same gear access to the HIV drugs since 2003.

Mexican Waters, a member of the American Indigenous Association, condemned the charges on the week of their activities that a member of the staff published personal information on the legal pages of law.
Demkart Party from Los Angeles insisted that such claims are being made from the foundations and websites of "The Most Right of the People's Left".
In a statement on Twitter, Walters said, "It's all lies, lies, and even more harmful."
According to a report published by the American Senators from South Carolina, Lindic gurus and Ottawa's camera and phone numbers of homes and phone numbers from the U.S.A.
Reporters show online online, which was published by the Supreme Court of the U.S. Supreme Court on the charges of sexual abuse against Bret Kaono.

Hal reported that such sites such as the GT WWDT and Red State, as well as the IPAAAIDS, are connected to the office of the Department of Waters and also to a member of the Waters.
Walters added that this unsatisfactory accusation was completely wrong and a plain lie.
My staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been threatened by these frauds and false accusations, are not responsible for keeping them in any way.
This is an unsatisfactory accusation that's completely wrong and plain.
On Twitter, online reactions were immediate, including Wiittt House's former press release Eri Flasher.
Felisa wrote that it's very angry.
It shows that they don't have the spirit of being a crucifixion.
When someone's being accused of something they don't do, they should not be angry.
They don't have to do with an accident.
They should not question the person's motives.
They need to be quiet and respectful."

Johny Englich Stragis Agnain - The World of Undiscovered Culture
It is now traditionally traditionally seen in any British perspective, but this is not true of Johnn Englich's action to work hard for the evils of the workers, which began in 2003 with John Englich and John Rebren in 2011.
Is this post made by private tools that clearly separate us from the people?
In any case, the eyes were out and the eyes were out and the eyes were still bright for the second time, and the sign of something more than anything else, and it was a long way to create an English-language baby's mother.
He's a crazy secret agent who has given up a few features of class, Mr. Ben's beauty and the beauty of London 2012 Olympics only one of the heads of Ferre's subjects.
His role is actually based on the base-based interactive stranger and international guy who came to the Barclay card TV news and left behind an anti-corruption.
There's one or two good moments in the latest JE meeting.
I liked to be moving to a helicopter with a bulletin in the middle of the Yanni Analsha region and its lips through her lips.
At the conclusion of Atticanson's show for Fissie Kashidi, but he is not alive and is seen in a strange way, especially "Great" movie brands such as 2007 and MisseImpossil are now presenting a symbol of trust with his own trust.
It feels it's for young children rather than for adults, and I'm so busy and not modern that the silent movements in Ben's personality are silent movements.
Now, the British is in serious trouble.
One cyber hacker's largest secret web network has been suspended and the identity of all British agents in the field has become a pain to the agency on duty.
It's the last resort for a great-granded-granded weak person, who is already victimized by an entire political corruption.
Their agents inform us that every active spy is in danger, they have to get a registered person.
And this means that there's a mistake to bring the mistake to Janny Angelesh, who is now a member of a school staff in a rural area, but about becoming a spy, offers the off guard: It's hard to stop in some places.
Jeanny is taken to the White House for a Hundging, and is republished with his former long-term companion Bo (Bugh), whose role is financed.
Bo is now a married man, all my commander, the role of a juli Hackas, in which the lawyer is a little bit thin.
So the Queen's Secretary's Secret Service comes back to an order to evaluate things in the way of Batman and Rubin, which has been faced by the San Offolio Ophilio.
On the continents, a nuclear technology is a very dangerous tool that claims that he can solve the problems of Britain's computer system: Manass Julta, whose role pays Jack.
Jeanny and Boa start their story with their vivid colors; they burn a French restaurant in the wake of a Vulpeto; they create themselves in Vulta's boat; and they create an anti-retroviation of themselves in the airfare; and they try to use them when they are in the airstrikes.
All dedicateds have been saved for this last, but as fascinating and stormy game is, the whole movie looks like you're watching the children's TV.
It's quite a difference of type content.
And as with other films of Jenny English, I'm always forced to think if the British Film Industrial Industries can't make any role to justice with her ability?
Liberty Party has rejected that he's planning for British citizens to work for four days a week, but take the price for five days.
Jeremy Corban's Library is considering the development projects under which Britishs will work four days a week, but they will pay for five days.
According to the news, the party wants its employees to transfer the child to workers who receive an extra day of free day from the anti-communication of artificial intelligence.
Under it workers will enjoy three days' Wicks - but the family will be taken as much as they do before.
The media said that this idea would be ‘agand’ for the existing parties and projects that want the country to submit to the rights of activists.
The trades that moved to the four days of the week have been approved by the UN Congress so that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior journalist at the Liberty Party told The Sandy Times: It is expected to be expected before the announcement of policy is over the year.
These nights will not be night but the fourth week of the four amam car is a movement that is responsible for resurging the economic balance of the party's community, but it's worth it.
The Liberty Party is not the first party that has confirmed such an idea, but the Green Party promised the week of the general elections in the 2017 campaign.
However, the Liberty Party is not in agreement with this idea.
A translator from the Liberty Party said: "The four am is not the policy of the Car Party and is not considered by the party.
In the past week, he used his idea to bring a social revolution into the economy.
Mr. MacDonal said that they are determined to return power from the "registers of different faces" and the media.
The chairman of the debate also means that the current sharers in water companies will not be able to get their own share because the Lebanese government can ‘attain’ because of the wrong act.
He also confirmed the plans of the workers to join the companies and 10 percent of the members of the private province, which would lead to the development of a multi-national property fields, which would lead to £500 a year.

I thought to go to the hearing. I spoke to J.K. Kaonoon.
After the charges came up, I called the Kanoya and said, "What have you done?"
In time, he was still a slave.
However, Gram's idea has not changed.
He must be accused of changing his opinion about Brit Caoo.
Dr. Ford doesn't know what happened, but I must know that Brett's got his target.
They don't believe anyone's name.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see a big change.

He also inspired his first story to choose - Peruud from the North - who was playing in his mind during his preparation for the Olympics, and still continues.
According to the British Times, BC radio is presented on 11:15.
Hoot of the Formic Malkins was added on Saturday to the sound of a week.
America will set up a record on Sunday when they'll play their 47-year-old drummers, but they'll have to restore their form to avoid creating a bad thug.
Macmillan, who's been playing 12 times compared to coming after every six months, is a record that has been included for Ferbes and Feruses on the day of the week.
Instead of being the center of the people's eyes, which is often for America, Macmillan, five times won his day in the role of a senior leader and working on his game to eliminate his weaknesses.
They never could throw the whole ball in the corner of their career, so 48-year-old player isn't suitable for the Golf National section, where the long-term land inflicts severe torture on the wrong shots.
And even if course isn't so difficult for itself, on Sunday, on Sunday, Macmillan's side will be with the British Olympics general, who with the ban against Tommy Fitwood this week.
If the Americans who start at the beginning of the 12th season have four points on the loss of four points that start at the beginning of the 12th season, the match can truly prove important.
Ferk expressed his confidence in his player.
He said, "He thinks he's doing well today, he's on my back, and he's going to be ready for me and he's gonna be ready for tomorrow."
He has put his trust in the Almighty.
He's a favor and he's given a lot of money in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two matches.
I thought more than that, but what was going on happened and maybe we thought so.
He wants to be in the field like every other player.
He's gonna play Sunday and play the best-fashioned game of good Foldo.
It may end with the captain's career, but it doesn't match his individual record.
Macmillan succeeded 18 times, and 20 times failed, and seven times as many as seven times, although Ferruk said he had a lot of fun for the team.
He explained that he's a joke, a tricky, like to pull the crowd with people and know the team's room.
I think young players enjoy it with it, and this week has been a great pleasure.
It gets a lot more than a game.
European Captain Thomas Berin knows that big lead may soon end.
European Captain Thomas Barrin knows from his experience that much of the heavy lead in the final seven days of Dr. Coup can easily be changed into anxiety.
The Danish player started his career in Wall Street in 1997, with a team of five above five points on the US, but with a lot of narrower than 14 to 14 or 13 times.
Berin said you're reminding yourself that we had a large lead in Wallrama, we had a big lead in the Brooklyn line, where we got defeated and we won in Waldruna, but very little.
So history tells me and everyone in the team that the situation is not over.
Today, with complete preparation, go to tomorrow field.
Let's do everything right there.
The thing doesn't end until you get a point on the board.
We've a high degree, and it's that it's going to be alive, and we're all focusing on it.
I've always said that I'm focusing on 12 players of my CD player, but we're very well aware that we're dealing with the world's best players.
Happy with the performance of my athletes at a hard golf course, Berin added: I never tried it.
Tomorrow we'll have a different call.
Tomorrow, individual activity will be highlighted, and there is a different thing to do.
When things are done, it's wonderful to be in the field with a partyer, but when you're alone, then you're a golf.
It is the message that prepares you thoroughly and take advantage of their abilities.
Now you leave your party behind and you have to go and show your full potential.
Berin's head, the opposite number, expects to show the best performance in the community than their athletes, but only two-points from the four-points.
In both heads of these unexpected changes during the last few days of the Ferrique, there was a defeat after becoming part of the battle in Brooklyn, when Europe's team found "Dinna".
When asked how his athletes were taken to the last day of the day in 1999, I replied that I remembered every word of it.
Tomorrow we'll have 12 important matches, but you'll want to reach that fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Madona.
When she's moving on one side, she puts a lot of pressure on the middle channels.
We're going to replace it with our lines. That's how we're going to show some sort of magic.
Thomas was taken to the rear of the response attack, and he faced the opposition with the Russian client at the top of the tower, and Paul's case on the day, on June, and on the way, to Jammu, Tom, and Ian Colportator and Lup, in the top of the Europeans.
Berries said about his music in order to keep my athletes in order because I think it's covering the whole game.
The new German warship was again tied to the ship
The New Frontier of the German Navy was to take place in 2014 in 2014, but it could not happen until the next year, according to local media, according to local media and Hosgwara.
The Dai Zaati newspaper reported on a military translation that the first ships of the new Bundan-Vortemberg class were ready to be called "San Land Fles" was now met until the first day of the 2019.
The ship had to join the Atlantic in 2014, but then the disturbing problems of Delerie has brought to ruin the project.
The four ships of Budden-Virtberg classrooms that have been given in 2007 will take the place of the old Berman class.
It is thought that these ships are a powerful ship of different kinds, different airplanes and plane planes, such as Reddington, Erde Reddr, and Soviet.
Other important features include more long periods of Mantans - what is possible from the modernest Fritzs for two years?
However, Dy Zaat has pointed out that the modern warships will continue to make them into the service before they enter the service. It's said that this ship will enable Germany to show their power across the sea.
At least F125 feet last year when the German Navy refused to register the ship immediately and sent it back to Bulomham & Sofia in Hamburg.
It's the first time that the Navy has returned to a plane after the delivery.
There were little information about the reasons for this return, but German media referred to “the number of serious criticisms of the software and hardware” that would prevent the warship if it was to be suspended.
The scales of software were particularly important because the ships of Bundan-Vortemberg's crew had only 120 cells - about the strength of the people on the old Bronman classrooms.
The incident also revealed that the seaship was extremely high which limits its efficiency and ability to add up to the future for the Pacific.
It is believed that 7000 tons of vanilla is used by the Germans in World War II by Germany.
In addition to poor hardware, training of the entire project has also been a problem.
It has been said that it has reached $3.6 billion ($.6 billion) from the start of 2.2 billion UUUU.
The importance of new Ferguests' problems is recent developments that Germany’s crisis is getting stronger.
Early this year, Hans Peters, head of the German Parliamental Committee, admitted that ships are in lack of ships being used to be trained.
He said that this problem has been serious in time, since ships were emptied but their new ships were not provided.
He laments that no freebits of Budden-Vortemberg class cannot be included in the Pacific.

But there are many things we can't know yet, so the things we're doing here or in other places will help you understand what they need to appreciate.
He insisted that there must be to find out before the work in the buildings is started, because it is likely that women and children will be killed by the destruction of an attacker, perhaps by the destruction of the entire country.

The host Chriss Wells asked why.
Sandras said, " although the lack of fiances were not due to the ill-fated reporters, I would not deny the fact that they are."
So they suggested that a direct connection between the Trump and the press would increase.
Without giving any reference, they said, "The people have the most questions and answers to the previous president: We have seen them."
Said Sandras, "Fifangs will still be, but if the President has the right to ask the U.S.'s right questions, it is certainly better than to talk to me.
We're doing our best to do this and you've seen us do it in the past few weeks and when you talk to the President of the United States, this press will take place.
Trump often asks questions when we participate in the press conference when we participate with the White House or the public conference.
