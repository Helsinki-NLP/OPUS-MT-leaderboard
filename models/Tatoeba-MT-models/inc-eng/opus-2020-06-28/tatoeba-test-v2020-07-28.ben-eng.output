Tom is taking a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Will you go to America next month?
I don't want to swim.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He's not here yet.
I'm sorry!
I want to tell you so much.
The snow reflects the extreme purple triangle.
Come out.
They screamed.
I ran home.
We made pancakes for the Middle East.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're shouting.
He's Kasslin.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everyone saw it.
I give my cat food in the morning and in the morning.
My son came home.
I'm a student.
I'll be present.
Do you have the passport?
Please correct my voice.
Do what he says.
I'm so tired of seeing you.
Tom started to shout.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps him.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We saw them.
Today is June 18, and today is Murali's birthday.
Who won?
Let's get ready.
We have to ask empty Tom to do this for us, right?
Can I get these clothes to be done in an ibex?
I'm going to Osaka station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for this.
Someone's a Kasho.
I went to the bakery.
I learned to live without her.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Give me a moment.
Tom was busy with work.
I'm not proud of how I used.
I'm scared.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm kissing.
My hands don't work properly.
Forget Tom.
What bravery!
Is this Tom's book?
He's angry.
Who are you?
I could die.
Are you sure?
We have to go.
He ignores school.
I didn't want to see Tom.
They eat healthy meals.
My mother loves music.
He's got his head hot.
Wherever he went, his dog was behind him.
Who is this?
Can I work here?
There's a problem.
The old bottle is my business.
I love my drawings.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Don't you have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play golf.
He knows where we live.
I know your name.
Tom's not here now.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come on!
Stop making a crazier.
Was Tom there?
I've been bleeding this afternoon.
My back still hurts.
Where's Tom?
They look like American.
You were the only friend to Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father could drive a very good car.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his title's Jackson.
You know Tom more than me.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My stuff hasn't arrived yet.
Tom's not here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom keeps his word very little.
Eat something.
Is there anyone at home?
What do you do?
I think Tom's good.
Where do I get the stamp?
I'm going to swim.
Can he speak French?
Tom might want to take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
Just take a little more?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friends.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where will I demand my stuff?
We do whatever we want.
Tom is right.
I ran to my mother.
The book is for students who are not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Whom would you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserve.
Nobody's necessary.
Are you here?
The rest of them laughed.
How late will you stay?
Did you see the guy in this picture?
I lost my stuff.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want Tom to wake up.
My son's getting the economy.
The sky looks like snow can begin tonight.
How much is it worth?
You know exactly what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I just want Tom to be happy.
Those who live in a glasshouse should not be broken.
Why are you shouting?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his umbrella back.
Tom is home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm drunk.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city has split into a river east and west.
Come and see yourself.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tom's playing guitar.
Do you have any idea what to do now?
He's making lunch now.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth hurts.
How much do they do?
How much do you owe for extra weight?
Everyone loved Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you Japanese?
Let's just make it a little faster.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken your bones?
He's angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't move my right foot.
I'm dry.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What is that?
Here's your key.
We've seen more bad things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
Chorgoash likes Guzor.
You don't understand.
My mother hurts.
Sit at the table.
He's smaller than me.
What's your name?
We're waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use credit card?
It's too big, isn't it?
This book is found only in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I pay credit with credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went to Jackson's house.
He wore a black hat.
Anything else?
Everybody scoundrel.
Is there anything left for the students?
I eat noodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask them what they do.
Will you come in?
I'll tell you.
We like football.
What do you want?
Good evening.
He ate empty fruit.
I want a new suit for these shoes.
Everyone loved Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Enjoy.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'm going to swim, even if it's rain tomorrow.
My right shoulder is hurting.
My father was busy.
Everyone's ready to go.
I couldn't catch the train at 7:00.
He had two girls.
This is my wife.
Let's have a story.
Do you have a pen?
The class isn't starting before eight and a half.
You eat the lunch time?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
Can you say English?
What they did was wrong.
My son is longer than me.
Tom's parents were a singer too.
Here's your bag.
Tom is alive.
Looks like he's in Fabious.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat whatever you want.
Let go.
I'm a little confused.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Fill it.
How old are you?
Get Tom.
They're scared.
You're shouting.
I don't think it's gonna rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I love the light.
He grew up in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
People killed by the Teroans.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Tom's father is a pig.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's a time.
I never forget.
Where's the door up at UA11?
I'm fucked up.
Why are you shaking?
Tom wants his umbrella back.
Which time do you go to sleep?
The two countries established a deal between themselves.
I speak empty French with Tom.
Tom's been watching.
Can you get this a present?
Tom's in the garage.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's smiling.
He's not here yet.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
He's eating the fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
Terrorists released prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my wallet.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government's been able to stand up.
Get out of town!
Gunn up till Tirh.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
It's Japanese.
Have you seen him get out of here?
Where'd you leave the bus for the airport?
Don't fight.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got it.
We walked on foot.
I want this.
I need those papers.
Tom was shouting.
Tom is very funny.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're a doctor.
The plane arrived at the right time.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the audience was businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I'm hungry.
Tom has won a lot.
He knows where we live.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Tom's washed up.
Everyone was shouting.
I'll stay out.
My mother can cook well.
They bit him.
The research was successful.
I think Tom would have to keep the gold that he had.
Boston is a big city.
Me, too.
Here's your key.
Let's go of Tom.
Eat your milk.
We're both named Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the flowers?
Tom's hurt.
Get behind the hat.
Is Tom still angry at me?
Tom Gowell's done.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen carefully.
We made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
I'll tell you if I do something.
We tried.
Tom has resigned on October.
The market is next to the doctor.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom put his head down.
Are we ready?
I like Tom Blue Anarus.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
Slow down.
They're there.
I'll bite.
Everyone's transformed.
Don't let me down.
Who was it?
I'm Lazuk.
When I said that Mary left town, it was amazing to see Tom.
I heard the screams.
When was your plane?
He doesn't want to talk about this.
I thought it was interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up today at 8 o'clock.
Please light the light.
Tom's hurt.
I'm still your friend.
Some pages took more than two hours to translate English.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is it the smallest route to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
What do you know him?
It's impossible!
When does the train reach Yokohama?
What time is it?
The words that are not correct, instead of being used as a regular translation.
Your shoes are here.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Can you hear me, this train goes to Washington Square?
We have failed.
There's Assis in this house.
Are you wearing the whole thing?
Tom Boston was playing.
Make it clear.
Don't open that.
Tom saw him.
It can snow in the evening.
I'm not proud of him.
Is anyone there?
It's wrong.
I'm no longer young.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Can you go fishing with us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
Wait a minute.
Tom was hurt.
Mary explained it.
I'm not denying it.
Don't see!
End it as soon as possible.
Use it.
When does the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand that either.
I got up at seven o'clock this morning.
I'm home.
Take it easy.
Merry Christmas!
I got inside.
Me too.
I'm not busy.
It's amazing.
Do it again!
Tom started breathing.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll be close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My leg is hurting.
Ask Tom.
I'm wondering what to give you a birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat the food you like.
We used to play park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy the ticket?
I've done my job.
I'm planning to stay in the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy.
Don't get in there.
We're lost.
Tom's shaking.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm just looking. Thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do I look?
Tom's not happy here.
He's angry.
I don't like coffee.
Speak slowly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here's your body.
We don't care what he does.
I called my good friend Tom.
We can't play better than that.
We're Lazuk.
The bill is going to be broken today.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know that this isn't right.
Eat whatever you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
