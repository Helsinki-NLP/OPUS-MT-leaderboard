The U.S. has to pay double tax on artificial intelligence.
As China has become more active in artificial intelligence, U.S. and needed to double the cost of research, says artificial intelligence researcher Kai-Fli, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement came from various parts of the government, announced in the United States, that the U.S. has a formal strategy in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has launched their new plan for the past year: its goal is to achieve 1 place in the production of artificial intelligence in the 2030s.
Lee also said, "Two budgets of artificial intelligence will start a good start in which most countries have a lot of backward and we're looking for a next step in artificial intelligence."

"All that we've done is on November."
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our life.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running out of all places to fight for the poor candidate," he said.
Trum continued, "You see this terrible, terrible redicated group of Democrats, you're already seeing it.
And they are determined to turn the force back in any way they need. You see this flimsy, compassion.
They're hurting people, they have to go to their ears to get power and control, they don't care what they want, they just want power and control, we don't give them."
He says Democritors are on the mission "to stop and stop."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, "and you've been calling the Democratics "the burning and unintelligent and untrustworthy".

"Remember his answer?
Did you shoot the case?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting-- it was really the worst body I've ever seen – the worst body I've ever seen.
It's no free organization.
Those who remember what they say don't have to endure here.
When the party members of my area accused me of voting, it wasn't a surprise.
Because you don't have to be welcomed by the Bola nature of your mind - I was the last one in the list for telling you this.
My Parliamental colleague Juan Raan found the same way because he stood firm against Judaism.
In my case, I was guilty of arguing with Jeremy Corbin.

On Friday, the first Leber meeting for the meeting said, "We want to include and develop our meetings."
In my eight years as a local lecturer, this Friday night's GCC meeting was the same.
Sadly, however, today, it is not the gold of the meeting and the promise of "good, gentle" politics has been forgotten for a long time, if it is true.
It is widely acknowledged that the Lebanese party has no difference and that each opinion is considered acceptable for the party's leadership.
As a leader of Jeremy, it started soon after I realized that I had the same political views with colleagues that they were expecting to give me a different political perspective and that I would not be willing to accept the position of any national security or e-mail.
Every time I speak publicly – and even though what I say doesn’t matter – there is a call to remove me through social networks, the central politics is condemned, and I am told that I should not be in the Lebar Party.
And it's not my only experience.
Actually, I know that I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I've been given to me are also political.
I was surprised to see the career and determination of all my colleagues who were subjected to discrimination or ethnic violence each day, but never shamed their career and determination.
The most frustrating part of the political era is how Gallup’s isolation has become normal
Last week, Jeremy Corbin claimed that the Leber Party should develop the culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are not free organization anymore and each "institution" has prevented the change of votes or elections.
For the past two years, many have been urging me to keep my head down, not to be so slow, and that I or I'll be "right"
But I didn't come to politics.
When I joined the boarding school 32 years ago, when I was invited to attend the boarding school, the Tishwar government was sentenced to our extended school class which literally destroyed the classes of our expanded schools, I tried to serve as a minister – regardless of the need for the local Council.
I've never been hiding my politics with the last elections.
No one at the Ningham East has ever been confused about my policy and the areas of conflict with the current leadership.
For those who preached on Friday, I'll only say that when the country is moving toward Brexit, business institutions and our public leaders are going to ruin our time and energy, I can't understand how to suppress their own time and energy.
But I really don't have a message for the Nathanham Motham, whether it's my election members or I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not prevent any lack of political threat or political commitments that I tell you to do.

Many Bolivian ICZ will see on a large screen across the country, hoping that the tribunal Bolivia of Hague will be in support of the claim that after decades of proper discussion, Chili Bolivia has been forced to discuss how to launch a ruling belt on the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's romanticist president - who will face a controversial fight for the next year - on Monday's rule too.
"We're too close to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts think that there is no chance to decide for the court Bolivia - and that even if it happens, it will change little.
The United Nations based on the Netherlands does not have the ability to give Chile and indicate that they will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
Only six months after ICJ's verdict, the case indicated that the case was “not light”, said Cheilian International Law expert Passeret.
And it could be back in the past four years more than ever to take the reason for Bolivia.
"The current Bolivia administration has hacked into the ocean," Jeret said.
The anti-war speech of Morals has promoted any enthusiasm in Chile, saying:
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk to a woman, but it will be hard to discuss later.
Two countries have not been transferred since 1962.
The Bolivian representative of The Hague, former president of former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltji, refused to be too quick to make the decision.
On Monday, Bolivia's new era of "a wonderful opportunity to deal with Chile" and "an opportunity to end a 139-year-old debate with the Chinese."
Kalzadila also denied that Moralalus - still using the Latin American president - Merrytem issue as a political issue.
"Bolivia will never leave the right to enter the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"It's the chance to see that we have to cut off our past"

Ryong Ho says that if Washington cannot believe Washington, his nation would not put nuclear weapons first.
On Saturday, on Saturday, the United Nations General Assembly.
He calls the United States to follow the promise that the United States promised at a top convention in Singapore.
His comments came to the attention of the United States Foreign Minister, Mike Pymp, as it seems, there is a way to re-continent nuclear collapsing with North Korean Kim Jun in Singapore three months later.
Ri says it is a "pipe" that keeps the bans and endangers North Korea's opposition to the end of the Korean War.
Beware of Washington that Pianong may agree with the announcement without the process of taking into account the first important issue.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Tempe desire the second convention.
However, there is a widespread conflict that Syria has to leave Pianong, which is probably the only way to guarantee his security.
Pimp also wants to travel to Pianong in the next month to prepare for the second Kim-Temp meeting.

You don't need to see if you want to expand your hat collection or block the sun completely.
The designer and Tom Brown Runway revealed a series of Ooversiseed Heads of the Garden that made Paris fashion fashion a week.
The summer has been extremely unusual in hat Instagram, and the designers have sent the puzzle of Katawa to their eyes.
Vallenino was one of the creations of a heavy top-to-pee hat hat that was decorated with a large shield that covered the models.
Other Oversiders include the lacquer waters, a wizard's hats, even a mirror - but they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Thomas Brown also published a choice of the Abbott mask - and at the right time for Halloween.
A lot of color masks were similar to the Hannibal Lecter.
An creation resembles complete scooby Diveing gear, another of which resembles what is known as a melting ice cream.
And if you continue the huge fashion statement - you're lucky.
Steale's monitors have given us a glimpse of large bottles that can go near you to the High Steward St.
Outsided hats are contesting 'La Bomb', double-fashioned hats from Rinna, each is shown to me from Ali Razkovskiski.

Paris fashion Wiktwy, La Rivier's LSAAAA at La River, is a low-reference bag with Rafya freeing and with a white head handle at top.
Selbritist Luke Luke Armitage reported: "I hope the bags will be large hats in the next summer - since designers have so big impacts on the demand of Oversity."
John Edward: Language skills needs world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have maintained a track record of Academic superiority, and it continues to continue with an even higher test that only works by art, art, music, and other communities.
The schools represented by more than 30,000 students across Scotland, including over 30,000 students of the Scottish Council of Indignant School (SCIS), try to give their students and parents the best level.
International schools aim to prepare their students for more and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As a educational field that is designed and applied in a particular school, we see modern language at school as popular and preferred.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person with a language he understands, it’s his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it's his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to create relationships and trust with people of other countries.
From recent tests of this year's experiment, we see that languages are on the top of the top of the footprints in the Indian school.
A total of 68% of the students of foreign language students have won the highest grade.
Reports from 74 members of the SCIS school show that 72 percent of students acquire high grades in Mandarin when 72 percent of German studies, 69 percent of French studies, and 63 percent of the Spanish study.
This proves that the indigenous schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
The language is now, as it is popular, the textbooks of independent schools and other ethM issues (e.g. science, technology, and math) are being held in the same way.
A study by the Commission for MM and Skyells in 2014 shows that 17 percent of the workers have blamed their language skills.
More than that, language skills are needed for young people to prepare for their future careers.
These skills are needed in the global world for more possible work opportunities.
Whoever chooses any career, if they learn a second language, they will have real benefits in the future with their life skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people of the country is automatically ahead of the competition.
According to the 2013 report, 75 percent of users in Ukraine were not able to speak well in a foreign language and the only language in French - 15 percent of the French languages.
That is why it is important for children to invest in language education today.
More languages, especially in developing economy, will be a better opportunity for children to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school will be divided into their educational languages.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while looking at 2020, others will be considered to be the most important language for Ukraine, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest may be, there will always be many languages to choose for special schools, including experts.
Scottish independent schools are devoted to providing a educational environment that will prepare the children and create them with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
It cannot be denied the moment that languages play an important role in the country’s future, so it must be reflected on education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "translator of international communication skills."
International schools will provide this choice, diversity and hospitality for the young people of Scotland.
Must be an action.
John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Indignant School

Although European glory goes from long ago.
As Alex Noren was joined by Bubba Watson and web Simpson had a problem for Forbby Najib Najiro Cereorga in the morning.
In the first nines, a Bogi and two Double-Serring Spaniard were thrown into a hole where they could never get up.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
It is interesting to see Farball and Forum from close to the side of the shoes they don't suggest that they don't suggest that the advice they give and the strategy that can be modified directly.
Europe has played good as a team and has taken an important lead in the final days, but the campaign session has also proved to be a testimony to the lack of the team US for fighting anything, particularly the state-stated.

North Korea says 'No way' will be perfect without faith.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the existing ban on the United States has increased the disbelief of the United States and that in this national situation, the country has no chance to give up nuclear weapons.
In the annual session of Re Young Ho, the World Society’s annual conference that North Korea took up nuclear test last year, the nuclear test, and the promise to prevent nuclear technology and nuclear weapons."
"We haven't seen any similar reactions in the United States." He said.
"We have no confidence in our national security in the United States, and there's no way we can have to establish ourselves in this national situation."
Even though Rushington's law on nuclearization was described by North Korean charges against North Korea as being rewarded for taking a slow action in North Korea, his statement was quite significant because he did not leave it as a matter of economies, as Pong has done in the past.
At the first conference between U.S. President and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12th, Kim Jong and Dond Temp referred to a joint statement that stated that Kim had promised to work on the "povers of Koreans" and when Tramp received protection from North Korea.
North Korea is searching for the official end of the war in 1950-35, but the United States said Piyongyang must first leave his nuclear weapon.
Washington also opposed the call for breaking the harsh international ban on North Korea.
"Merika stressed the "companiment" and raised pressure from restrictions to achieve their aims, even against the proclamation of "the end of the war"," says R.
"The idea that the ignorants can risk our earth is a mere dream of those who don't know about us."
But the problem continues to deepen our faith."
There was no comment on the plans of the second peak assembly between Ri Kim and Tamp that highlighted the United States's first week of the United States's presidential week.
Instead of the Ministry of High Court, the Minister of Mahdoud highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leaders: if the United States had died in South Korea in the past five months, it would not have been so difficult to maintain the neutrality of the Korean continent."
Yet, since Ryr's speech was very different since last year, when he told the UN general public department to target the U.S. headquarters with a North Korean rocket when the "Milil President" Camp Man said "The Rock Man" suicide.
This year, in the United States, Temp, the United States, threatened to destroy North Korea last year, praising Kim for her courage to take action, but said that there is still much work to do and the restrictions will be imposed until North Korea is armed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there is no time for it, he said, "If it takes two years, three years, three or five months to do it,"
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for taking the UN security measures.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State  according to McPimp, the United States Security Council, says on Thursday: "The bans of the Soviet Council will continue to continue as long as we fully appreciate the unsatisfactory integrity"
Since 2006 the ban on North Korea has largely been lifted in North Korea to stop the supply of the nuclear and biodiversity forces in Pyongyang.
Pomp also met Rii at the United Nations General Assembly and then said that he would travel Pyongyang again in the next month to prepare for the second convention.
Pimp has already visited North Korea three times, but his last visit was not good.
When he left Pianang in July, he said that some progress was made, just north Korea, to condemn him for a few hours!
North Korea promised the meeting with Mun this month and a nuclear complex break if the U.S. received “Religion”.
Kim said that Kim was looking for the "terrorist steps" that he was looking for in Camp Singapore and was the security guarantee that he had received protection from Washington and was in direct with Washington.
Hervard's students are taking the course to get enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is giving him a way to sleep all his senses to cope with the growing culture of the day.
One student discovered how a number of university students in the world are often confused about how they will care for themselves.
Charles Szila, a professor of medical science at Harvard Medical School and head of the University of Brigiham and female Hospital, has developed this course that believes it was the first time in the United States.
After giving a speech about the lack of sleep in education, he was encouraged to start the course.

He said that someone never told him about the importance of sleep - who surprised me, "He was telling the telegraph.

Paul Barira, director of the health department at Harvard Medical School and director at the University Health School, said that students decided to launch the university after a serious sleepless week.
One hour's long course has some connection to task.
One section contains a picture of the students' kitchen, where the students will know the effects of cafe, screen, and light by clicking on the coffee, screen, and books and how the satirical parks are affected by sleep, and will appreciate the importance of a battalion.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep can lead to heart attack, strokes, strokes, and cancers
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then urges the participants to think about their daily bread.
'We know it won't immediately change the behavior of students.'
But we believe that they have the right to know - even if they decide to smoke your cigarettes, they have the right to know the effects of health, "percessor Shirazila added."
He says that pride is still existing, he adds, "a growing problem with modern technology and education."
You should be a student's "arm weapon" to fight a student who is conscious of well-being, fatigue, and anxiety, saying that even the sleepy brain makes them hungry.
Remand So, 19-year-old professor, who studied chemical and physical biology in California, has also taken a class during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and caused him to urge for a campus-head course.
In the next step, she hopes that all student students will be able to complete a study program before attending the competition.
Professor Siegila recommended that students should consider when and when to when to go to bed and when to wake up, and should be aware of the damage of the damage caused by the UK screen and LID light, which can cause your sacing to sleep by destroying the syringe and sleepy.

"The members of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been exposed because of the fraud and false accusations - somehow not responsible for this information.
This unconfirmed complaint is completely wrong and a perfect lie."
The statement was quickly received by many online criticisms from the former White House's former press Sachab.
"It's unacceptable," Flisher wrote.
"It says he has no intention of becoming a Congress member."
Don't get angry when anyone is accused of what they didn't do.
They must not be a traitor.
They certainly shouldn't be questioned about the purpose of the accused.
They must be cool and clear."
Compared with criticism of the judge Kavana, who was comparing the reactions of Waters, satser, and critics considered him to be very upset during a Thursday hearing.
Omar Nevero, who has chosen to resign Waters in the Central elections, has also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If the truth is, it's bigger," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office has warned the "Usual authorities and law enforcement agencies" about the fraud demands.
"We will make sure that the criminals will be exposed," he continued, "and that any member of my staff and all members of the community will be held accountable for their actions."
Johnny English Strykes Eggin reviews - weak Roan Atkinson's spy
In any new photo including Britain, it is traditional and it seems to apply to the restoration of the John English Action-Med Spoof Frances - which began in 2003 and returned to John English's life in 2011.
Clearly, how much of the garbage nation will be able to make a new roundup?
In any case, pop-pocket, there is a license to create new things for Johnny English a second time - the name of his name suggests that he designed a wide-scale film system without English.
He must have contributed a note of the openings of the Olympics of the Olympics in London, despite the development of the seasonal secret representative, Mr. Bin, a dopp.
He based mainly on the Traval, and the international mystery man, Atkinson, once played on the barcracked TV advertisings, spread chaos in science.
This last Zee outing has one or two sad moments.
I'd like to see John English in a little English with a small helmet wearing a central armor suit.
The gift of Attkinson for physical jokes is seen, but the joke has been extremely low and unusual, especially "cirys", especially the "Syrias" brands like MmpCable and missionsman Mimps.
The joke seems to be more designed to children than adults, and I don’t have such an art and adhesive accidents in public English as well as in the personality of Atkinson's Night of Silence.
Many times, the telegraph base is the Great Britain has been in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker introduced a secret web network to Britain's spy network to express his identity to the British agents in the case, a sad role for Kevin Allen.
This is the last trust of a Prime Minister who has already suffered the worst in politics, he is unhappy and devoted personality: Emma Thompson made the best of his character with this half-tresa-me, but there is nothing more to do with script.
His intelligence advisors told him that every active spy had been expelled, so he would have to get out of bed.
And it means that John English, who is now appointed as a school teacher in a few behind companies, learns beyond the record: there are some good jokes here, since there are some good jokes here, since English Rock-Tep Academy's High School for School in Gondagh.
English came back to the White House for emergency calls and again Ben Millar's engagement with his former long-extreme companion Bau.
Bao is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a jelly-hykey-Sticky role in which Wiki Pepperdin has been kidnapped.
So the Batman and Robin returned to Action to Action, Ollga Kurenko, a non-mominary woman Ophilia.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Karrishmetik Bilion, who claimed that he can solve the problems of Britain's computer system: Jack Lasie Lacveta.
English and Bao’s strange sound of high-insurgency begins: In a flash French restaurant in the center of waiters, they took fire; they started beating themselves on the Voltache Bassul boat; and using the heavy metal roof to identify themselves with the English voltre house.
All the tops must have been for the last step, but it's as sweet and warm as it's, the whole thing has a lot of children's TV.
Nice staff.
And I couldn't think of any other John English film: British film industry won't play a role to Ronan Atkinson which is true to his stand?
Leber refuses that it is planning to work four days a week for Britain, but will pay for five days.
The Leber Party of Jeremboin will consider a basic plan that the British will work for four days a week - but the price is up for five days.
The group reports that the owners of the organization want to share the money from an extra day saved by artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
It will see workers enjoy three-day holidays - but still will take the same salary home.
According to sources, the idea with the party's economic program will be "fat" and is planning to move the country to the workers.
Trades Union Congress allowed workers to transfer a four-day week as a chance opportunity to make a change economy.
The Sunday Times, a senior member of the Lumber Party, told the Sunday Times: “A policy will be declared before the end of the year.
"It won't happen, but it's a wish for four days' activities, along with the labor force, to support the community's social industry in the economy."
On the first of the nine Leber Party to support this national idea, Green Party promised four days of work days during their general election campaign in 2017.
The desire is not currently supported by the Lebanese party, even if it is not currently supported by the Lebanese party.
A spokesman for the Lumber Party said: "It is not a four-day work party policy and it is not considered by the group."
John MacDonaldel of Shado Chansel used the last week to show his views for a social revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonal says he is determined to return power from the "unprecious Director" and from 'Lavbans.
The plan of Shado Chanssel can take back the current share of water agencies because the labour government can provide some ‘s’ for the wrong actions of the labour government.
He also confirmed the plan to keep workers at the board office and provide the owners of the annual LaVanah funds for 10 percent of the private sectors of private sectors, which are standing at $500 a.m.
Lindsay Granny, tell John Kennedy "60 minutes" if Kavanna's FBI investigations can change their mind.
The judge questioned the charges against Brett Kavana, the FBI investigation in the FBI court delays a week in the final vote about his nobrows, and questioned whether the investigations could turn back to a Republican Senator.
On Sunday an interview with a "60 minutes" reporter, Scotty Patley Réblan, asked people John Kennedy and Linds Garham that the FBI could find something that might transform their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleagues in South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you to go to the hearing room, I spoke to judge Kavana."
I called her after this incident, and she came out of the complaint, saying, "Did you do this?"
He was firm, unskilled."
Gramm's vote, of course, seems to be unattainable.
"My Brett Kavana is made up of and will need a very important charge to change," he said.
"D. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know: Brett strongly denied it," says Christine Blaisesy, mentioned Grass Ford.
"and whose name he said they couldn't verify.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see a new change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and did it do something to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday, New York, a annual music event that has a disaster line in the Far East and one similar to the abduction mission of the world to end poverty.
In the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will only see thousands of people walking around the central park to enjoy activities like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mands, so it is not possible to see thousands of people traveling to the central park, but to see the real need for the end of widespread poverty within the 2030s.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is a expansion of the global poverty project, a group of people hoping to increase the number of people who fight internationally.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don’t want to pay for VIP ticket), like Constigators, or "active", such volunteers, such as volunteering to send an e-mail to a world to raise awareness about their goals, calling a phone or other poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizens been in reaching his goal for 12 years?
What is the real step to reward people by using a concert in which the idea is to invite people to take action, or another case of so-called "Ccultivism" - where people think they are actually signing online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have said that it has recorded more than 19 million “Crea” than his supporters, moving forward toward reaching goals.
It says that these measures have helped world leaders to express the same commitments and policy that will affect the lives of 2.2 billion people in the 2030s.
In the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and announcements that began from its activities, including at least 10 billion dollars already distributed or funded.
The group estimates that the security funds have yet to have a direct effect on some 649 million people around the world.
Some of the major promises are the power of nuclear, UK-based investors and investors in "acting to help their parents to raise their full potential," making Global Citizens promise to provide more than 4,700 tweets after receiving more than 35 million tweets.
"In support of the UK government, donors, national government, and Global Citizens, we can make the social injustice a part of history" when a power concert was launched in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 steps to improve the growth of mother and children in the United States, the government declared the money for a project, the power of the Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In answer to a question asked on its website, "What do you think we can end up in extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered: "It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail."
However, like great citizen rights and anti-terrorism movement, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Windman, Sun Mandness, Cardi B, Janel Mony, who will perform this year's presentation in New York, will continue in Debrera-Lens and Hy Jackman.

Kremlin's argument is that the project is not the reason for Washington's strong opposition to the economic and example of an extraordinary competition.
"In my belief, we agree that we cannot be used as weapons of fuel and have the ability to select consumers," says Alexander Novak, the minister of Russia's fuel department, after interview with the US Jubalani Minister in Moscow in September.
The U.S. positions of the United States have contributed to negative reactions from Germany, resurfaced to Germany's commitment to the German project.
The German Institute of Germany (BDI) in the art industry asked the United States to stay away from the fuel policy of the European Union and apart from the apartheid agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"After the latest meeting between Angela Marcel in Germany and Russia's president Vladimir Putin, the principal of the Federal Institute of German India (BDI), says that we have a major problem with our fuel supply.

The British supported the fighting.
A study shows that the former Governor Davail Patrike has more support for the vote, with 38 percent of the possible fight and 48% did not.
Other high profile-dependenced in the 2020 votes are included among the former vice president Joe Beneden and Senator Barney Sanders.

The full name of the bear on Grace V. Sessions case, which was not published in August against the U.S. Civil League Federal Policy.
He said that his union "and his violent gang members," he called him "and the boys of his violence gang," but the US officials refused his request on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Attorneys from Greece's allies provide an example of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as a large country facing the problems of gang and family violence from which many demand refuges from the US.
The new American asylum policy has turned into the 2014 International Board's decision to request asylum for non-registered migrants who have fled for domestic violence.
"The new policy, Federal and International Law of Colombia, said on Friday that the new policy "is ignored by the state, Federal and International Law".

The U.S. ambassador complained about the "Propagonda advertisement" against China.
A week after the U.S.-C. commercial benefits of the US, a government newspaper accused the US of using the US press to promote the campaign against Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned the post on Wednesday, the largest Chinese daily day in China, and complained of China's intervention in the U.S. Congress election on November 6.
Trump was accused of trying to intervene in the US elections, which the U.S. officials said to Reuters, a new attempt to force China to pressure China.
It is normal that foreign government would advertise commercial commercialism, but Beijing and Washington are now sent to the business war that has caused them to increase salt in imports.
Chinese and US experts say that early in the fall of the trade, the anti-retroviral salts were designed to harm the Rolfanan Party in China, like Iwa, who supported the Republican Party in the beginning of the trade.
A long time ago, former U.S. ambassadors and former Governor Terry Branstead, who is a major reporter in China, says that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In a post on Brended Sunday's Demans Regester, China, says that China has doubled the pride by "we've had in our own free propaganda."
Brend writes, "The Chinese government has taken illicit advantage of the United States' freedom of speech and free news coverage through the media."
"On the other hand, you will find limited anti-war voices on the streets of Beijing and you will not see the real difference between the Chinese people's concerns about the Chinese economic path, because the media is moving here to the Islam of China's Communist Party."
He also said that his post “A major newspaper in China refused to print, although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.”
The Republicans have been trying to keep women voters away before the Kanvanf debate.
In a number of charges against the Supreme Court's non-Muslim sexual abuses, analysts have been standing beside the Supreme Court's Nomination and hiding warning that they will be able to see the negative reaction from women in the incoming Midst Medgettm election.
The emotions surrounding it are extremely high, and most Republicans are already trying to move on with votes.
In a post published by the University of Saraquez, Grant Reherhar, professor of state science at the University of Psychology, said to the Hill, "They cannot come back."
Ryhar says that in the last hour of the FB I investigation, the pressure to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington DC's newspaper, the earliest history of the newly formed Movon community and the National Women's Face said on Friday, "Don't forget what happened to Jean-Pi - they won't forget tomorrow and November."
Despite Dr. Christian Blaisezi Ford's testimony, the judiciary committee of the judiciary committees of Kavanf's nines announced Friday morning during the protest in the city's airport, the protesters chanted "November" during the protests on Friday.
"Representative political analyst Rothenburg said to the news site," will be the past as democratic bread and inspiration.
"He says he's already there; it's true.
But it may be more, especially among women in the city, and between 18 and 29 young voters who don't vote for the president.
Even before the case of the Supreme Court's electoral candidate, the analysts also suggested that if the Republicans were to go out with consent.
"It has become a complicated issue for the GOP," said former chairman Michael Steel NBC on the Republican National Committee earlier last week.
"It's not only about votes or final votes, but how the Republicans took and how they used it with it," says the director of the DSA group, who helped the vote.
However, Americans seem to be a little confused about who to believe in in the witness of Fords and Kavanf, the next person's opinion seems to be heavy.
A new study in Uganda revealed that 41 percent of the response believes the testimony of Ford, or perhaps 35% of them say they believe in Kavanf.
Also seen, 38% said they thought Kavanaf was probably lying during his witnessing time, and only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After the fluctuation, the FBI is now investigating the case of Debro Ramez, the Guardian's report.
Ford has testified to the judiciary committee last week in front of the trial committee that Kavanf was killed by the age of 17.
Ramirez complains that the Supreme Court showed her sex at a party during her school education in Italy in the late 1980s.
The World Wide Web has planned to start a new Internet project to play with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lely, founder of World Wide Web, has launched a stage to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The final project of the technology Kingdom, Intravenous, is a company that will create Berners - open source platforms.
Social users have the right to choose where their data will be stored and which information will allow people to access access.
In an interview with the first company, Berners-Lely joked that the real purpose of the Ingregator is "the sovereignty of the world."
"We have to do it right now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historical moment."
The app allows everyone to create P and D or "Personal online data store" using social media technology.
It may include contact list, to-do list, calendar, music library and other professional tools.
It's the Google Drive, Microsoft outbound, Black and Spice all in the same browser and the same.
It is unique to the personal online data store that will completely rely on the user - who can access information in any form.
The company's name has been named "personal power via Deter."
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea of the Intranet will help all of them get their resources, processes, and suitable skills.
The organization is currently composed of a security platform which is purchased by Barners, Bruce, IMBM, some contracted online developer and volunteer coder.
This week, technology developers around the world can use tools on the Internet to create their own creative applications.
Berners-li said that he and his team would start a whole change with Facebook and Google where all their business model models will be completely modified."
"We don't want them."
In a post published by the media on Saturday, Barers-Le wrote that the Inrp's article "Internet is to provide commercial fuel and quality to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on clay"
In 1994, Bernard-Le Meschussets changed the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Conservatorium in Technology.
In the past few months, the Nettrition debate became a powerful voice.
Even during the launch of this article, Berners-Lely World Web Conservatorium, web Foundation and Open Data Institute will still be the founder and director of the Open Data Institute.
"I'm impossible about this future of the web," Barers-li adds.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cleric celebration of the First Infidelity
The hundreds of years of the original city celebrates the Church of England, the only priest in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I.

One of his dances, Michael Van, says it is “very important” that the memorial is released after 100 years of his grandfather's career.
According to London Gates, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel van led his battalion through a huge shots of land and machines that led him to the D St-Centin Canal.

MM was awake all night to see 206 Beloto, but instead they found Pepa Pyg instead.
Consider, you woke up all night to see a great Bellat, and the main event wasn't shown.
There were 13 feet with six feet on the main card from San Jose and the entire channel was live on the 5.
In the morning, when Georgard Moussi and Ry MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the coverage changed and shocked the audience of the United Kingdom.
Especially for the fight they were awake until early morning, some people were outraged.
On Twitter, a veterinarian child changed cartoons as "a dirty joke".
"They were forced to change the cartoons in order to answer the question of "the broadcasting of children" by Bellato Swaraj, who said that they were not worthy of such a show at 6 a.m.
"The Pepper Pig," yes.
President of Bellato's Association Scott Corkern says that in the future the UK's audience will work on making time to think about them.
"We may be able to solve it at the time of the release," Koker said.
"It's not possible to do this by Sunday morning and our Sundays, until Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, there's a lot of messages coming next, and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be some technical mistake.
But no, it was official.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We'll cut it into five Fights instead of six-- the way we normally do - the opposite of trying to increase the fan.
It's a bad situation."
George Island disk: Tom Daily is suffering from “inhumanity” because of sexuality.
The Olympic Diamond Tom Daily said that during growing up, he was a victim of a lack of sexuality - but it led him to success.
This 24-year-old said she didn't go to the media school until she didn't know that "by me."
On the first radio station Laurenne Lancen, he told me that he spoke about homosexuality in giving others "God" rights.
He also said that after the birth of a child, his concern for the Olympics has diminished.
Christy Yang, a regular speaker of the long-term events, has taken several months since his illness.
In the first event in Lover's first event, Daly said that he felt "so" more than the rest of them, because "the choice of Chael-mes was not socially acceptable."
He says: "To this day, that little feeling and feeling apart has been a reality that has enabled me to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove himself to be a "one" so that everyone can know about her sex so that they won't be disappointed.
In the Olympics, this high profile has become a global media campaign and has used his presence to appeal to more countries in Australia to recognize equality.
He said he opened his mouth because he thought he was lucky to live in public without complexity and wanted to give others "the wish."
The World champions of these three times spoke of a man in love - American filmmaker Daniel Black, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Dale married the winner of the Osaka last year, who was 20 years older than he was, and said that age had no problem.
"When you were so young - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died three years later in cancer - he said it was hard to find someone who was so hard to see.
The couple had born a son named Robert Re Black-Delle in June and Dale said he had changed his "full outlook".
He said, "If you asked me last year, I would say, 'I have to win a Gold Meddle' this was my knowledge.
"The truth is, there is much more than the Olympic gold.
Robbie is my Olympic gold.
His son's name was Robert, who died in a brain cancer in 2011.
Deli says his father never admitted that he was dying and he finally asked if their ticket was confirmed for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I never said that you'd be there for the first row," he said.
"I took her hand while her breathing stopped, and until she left and died and I didn't admit that she wasn't incompatibility," she said.
The following year Dale took part in the Olympics and won the Bronzepuk.
He said, "It was my whole life-time dream of getting diving in front of my audience, it's nothing better than that."
It also inspired his first song's choice - the title of Hedar Smul - who was with him in preparation for the Olympics and who still gives him a hug.

Milcson Shanbeer will sit in the kitchen at the Ryder Cup, off-form.
The American Phililson will build a record for playing his 47th Red Cup match on Sunday, but if you don't want it to be unfortunate Michaelstone, he must be in his form.
Milcson, who has been playing 12 times in this second-time event, had to sit in the beach instead of Captain Jim Furrick, for Forbour and Forum.
Instead of staying in the center of the U.S. Games, what he was playing in the United States, the day of the five-day Medleyder's victory was spent on the performance of Chelyleder and playing his game in range.
While drivers are not always comfortable with the top of Kenya, it is not appropriate for the 48-year-old national course, which often makes long shots in trouble.
And if the course itself isn't enough, Michelson, Mitch, the British Olympics are facing the British Oceanic Molinary, who has managed to win four matches this week with Rusie Tommy Flutwood.
If Americans, who are at the beginning of the 12 signal match, can start a good start, Michelson's match may be important.
Führer showed confidence in him, even though he didn't have much to say.
"O today I understand fully, with my arm, he says he's ready for Kalka."
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's one of the men who gave the team a lot in the past and in the past.
I don't think he's gonna play a match.
I was hoping more, but that's what happened, and we were thinking about moving.
He wants to get in the field, just like everyone else."
On Sunday's match, Michelson Nick Foldro's greatest radio match will be released.
It can end up in the hide camp, which does not even count its personal record.
In the middle of the Milcson's lake, 18 wins, 20 times, and there are seven snows, although Ferri said his presence to light the team.
"He's a funny man, Amud, smart and smart, who loves people, like a team room and a great man," he said.
"I think new players enjoyed playing with him, even this week, that's what I loved.
He only gives more than a game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Andr knows that big waves can disappear too
Thomas Avern, European Captain, has learned from experience that even in the final days of the giant leader's cup of blood, it can be frustrating.
Dean's self-defense in Valdès in Valdrim in 1997, where a group led by Sve Belesters had five points to the Americans, but he won the Finnish line at 14 to 13 o'clock in March.
"You should remember that we had a big lead in the wells; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and the best place, where we won, where we've won, and we've seen him in the photo, on Friday and yesterday, on Friday and tomorrow, at 5,6.
History will show me that it's not done yet.
Let's get out of your mind tomorrow.
Get in the field and do the right thing.
It's not over until it's reached the board.
We have a goal, that's what Trophie won, and that's where we're gonna have eyes.
I've always been saying that I look at 12 of my team players, but we're also very aware of who's around the world.
Wearn adds that I am happy that our players did what they did in the hard golf course, "I'm never going to be very confident.
Tomorrow is a different fight.
Tomorrow will come before private perfume, and it's a different thing.
It's good to be with the partner when all goes well, but when you're alone in the field, your ability is fully tested as a golf.
This message is required to reach all players.
Now, you have to drop your partner and get the best out of it."
In contrast with the lightning, opposition Jim Ferrick will keep watch so that the players are more likely to play as a team personally, instead of Jordan Spider and Justin Thomas, who brought three points into the four points.
Führer himself also experienced the experience of the drama screen-to-president during the last day of the "Saday's miracle events in Europe" and as a party in Brooklyn.
During the last days of 1999, President Ben Cross asked for information about how his players were raised," he said, "I remember every word."
"We have 12 important matches, but you're gonna want to get rid of the beginnings like Brooklyn and Myanmar.
When the game breaks apart, there's a lot of pressure on the sides of the match.
We're going to create lines and we're going to dance the boys as we think we're going to do some time.
Paul Kessy, Justin Rose, John R. Ram, Tommy Flette and Yan Poultler, have been taking the lead against the Europeans, who will face Thomas at the beginning.
"I set this group up, because I think it will cover everything," Auron says about his elections.
The New German Warjazaz resurfaced again
Local news reports say that the former team of German Neves was supposed to be launched in 2014 to replace the warship of the former cold warships of the German Nation, but it will not be until the cost of the wrong system and the cost of snobbling for at least the next year.
According to the military spokesman Dee Zeit, the first "Rainland-Fuzze" ship of the new Ben-Berators was held until the first half of the 2019.
The ship was supposed to be involved in the Navy in 2014, but this high-dependence project has been in trouble because of the problems in Denver.
In 2007, the Navy that ordered the four Banden-Vermberg-Creatore ships will take place in Bremen-Clos Freege.
They will have a strong canyon, anti-aircraft and ant-shipd technology, such as Redwood Rader, Infrared and Aquatic series.
Other important features include long monitoring time - new freegresses will be able to monitor the maximum two years away from the country's port.
However, the final delay is a series of so-called civil war wars, which is supposed to help the country in Germany - it will be old at the moment of the flood, De Zee Zeit's news.
Last year, unfortunate F 125 freeguget came to the front of the German Navy when he refused to launch the ship, and returned to Hamborg's Blooms and Vos Schpeerde.
This is the first time a ship sends a ship back to campbird after the Navy delivery.
The reasons behind the back are very low, but German media referred to a number of important "software and hardware error" that would distract the ship.
The tools of software are particularly important, since the Boden-Vertemberg-Serrenary missions will be guided by about 120 Narrows—a group of people from the old Breggers.
Moreover, it was shown that the ship would slow its performance and create a barrier to link the future of the Navy's future.
This 7000 tons of "Rainland -Fez" is thought to be twice the same class of Germans used during World War II.
The cost of the entire project, including having trained crews, is also a problem.
From 2.2 billion pounds to 3.1 billion pounds (3.6 billion dollars).
New freezers have become more important in recent considerations of the recent warning warning warning against Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Pier Bartals, head of the German defense committee, admitted that "Mutine's suitable ship is going down in the Navy."
The official said that the problem was huge in time, since there were no extenuating ships that had been destroyed.
He laments that Benden-Veremberg was unable to join the Navy.
Listen to the national Trust in Uncovered Life
New research is being launched in an area of the Scottish Mountain to find out how to use the landfor food.
Hopefully, the findings will light up new light on the behavior of this unique flying creature and help preserve the future.
National Trust for Scotland's Sciences research will continue with the general and so-called pipes and even the Dobins of Wester's Guardian Guardian.
The entire season will be set up in important locations around the special record area.
NHS activists and volunteers will also run on a regular survey using a portable director.
Experts will analyze the sound of all recorded records and will be able to get information about what kind of species are doing.
Then there will be a visible map and reports to create a wide-scale image of their behavior.
NTS's nature director hopes the results will reveal that the results are the most important and how it is used by all species.
This information will help the management of dwellings, such as grassland, and how to protect the forest for plants and other related species.
In Scotland and the United States over the last century, the number has greatly diminished.
Building and development are in danger of damaging their sleep and homes.
The air based tarballin and light can also be dangerous, such as some of the floppypers and building products, as may be dangerous to attack cats as well.
The bat is not really blind.
Although their ears are more effective than their eyes because of the habit of hunting during the night.
They use a better sound-place strategy to mark danger and obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historical buildings across the country, has the importance of monitoring over 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares.
There are ten trained experts who regularly study, visit the sleeping places, and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also established the first and only busiest settlement in Scotland, the first and only busiest settlement in Scotland.
Astat manager David Thompson says, this is an ideal place for the deaf.
"There's a good place for the middle of the Three," he said.
"Here is the old building, there are many ancient trees and all good places.
But there are still many things that we still don't know, so we'll help us understand what we're doing here and in other places to save them."
He emphasized the importance of recognizing the presence of the bats before protecting property, since it could have destroyed 400 drug and children and children's baboons, and could destroy the entire local basil.
It is illegal to kill animals and kill, torturing or destroy their homes.
Elizabeth Feral, a Scottish officer at the busiest storage Trust, urged to help the public.
He says: "We still have a lot of knowledge about the rats and we don't know how many species live."
Ronaldo refused to accuse rape and the lawyers are trying to bring charges against Germany
The accused of rape has been described as "the story of a man who wants to raise his name."
His lawyers are ready to file a case against German news magazine Dor Spogel, who brought the case public.
The Portugal and Juvents Forward have been accused of rape by a American woman in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of paying $375,000 to keep silent on the case, and was arrested on Friday's Spogel report.
A few hours later, his Instagram live video called his 33-year-old "Meth News" when speaking with 142 million Peruvians.
"No, no, no, no.
It's a lie they said today, five times Balon-D-O's winner camera.
"By using my name, they want to grow in their identity.
It's a simple matter.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's a provision.
I'm a happy man and everything is going right." The player smiles.
According to the report of Rournador's lawyer, Rondor's lawyers are preparing to file charges about Dr. Spogel, who said they are “untrusted as unintelligent reports in the matter of democracy.”
The lawyer says that the player is “a serious violation of the importance of the sanctity of morality, which may be one of the serious violations of personal rights in recent times.
The story was reported on in June 2009 as a result of the attack by Poms Hotel and Kasino in Los Vegas.
The Navadir Clark County Court stated that after seeing a knight, Rondio and Maorgoga player, she was raped.
Moreaga claims that after the incident, Rondro bowed down and told him that he was disappointed by "99%" for "a percentage."
The document claims Ronaldro confirmed that they had sexual relations, but it was reasonable.
More claims that he went to the police and was taken to the hospital, but later he agreed to settle outside the court, because he was afraid of "groaning for revenge" and was afraid of being "distracted".
The 34-year-old girl says she is trying to raise the issue again because she has become emotionally troubled because of what has been said.
During that crime, Ronaldo was involved in joining the United States from the United States and joined the most famous club in Italy for 100 million dollars in this summer.
Brexit: You'll be 'cause you'll lose your position as a car manufacturer'
The Ministry Minister Greg Clark said that his place in the world is the first place in the world to lose his position in the first place after the Brexit.
He also said that it was "dangerous" that the United States told the BBC that if the British left you without a contract, they would stop producing their own product in Barbour.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car has reported that people can leave their jobs because of the delay leading to a traffic jam in the border.
Bernstein’s factory - which was built by Toyota Oris and Avians - has produced about 150,000 cars last year - about 90 percent of the remaining countries of the European Union have been exported to the rest of the country.
Marvin Cook, director of the Toursing Director at Bernstein, said, "My opinion is that if Britain comes out of EU at the end of March, the production of our factory can be stopped."
The European Union, including Hoda, M. M. Land Rover and Java, has expressed concern about leaving no contract with the European Union without any agreement about how to make any contracts, with no contracts, B.C. and Java.
For example, BM WW said that they would shut down their Miniature after a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers is the risk of the plan for the non-Brexitt.
Tour production line goes based on "ste-in-time", which comes from both UK and EU providers for orderal cars every 37 minutes.
If it leaves the United States without any contract on March 29, it can be interrupted in the border, which may delay in the direction supply, and the economy may be facing the crisis of the economy.
The organization said that it is impossible to keep more than a day's invented value in Toorta's Dbarsta plant, which could stop production.
Mr. Clark says that the future of Thora Mayor's plans for the future of EU have been properly implemented in this series of checks.
"We need a deal, and we want to do the best not only to keep success but also to enjoy the possibility of future improvements," said the BBC Radio today.
"Not the cables, but the other producers also prove that it is very important to continue the success of the plan chain."
Unable to say how long the toilet will be shut down, but they have warned that the long-term cost will decrease the performance of factory competition and that this may lead to many jobs.
Peter Suvales, who worked for 24 years in Bernton and this plan, said that his members expressed concern: "When I experience this, they don't come back."
One official said: "We have to make a specific and reliable plan for the future with Yu."

On Friday, the FBI ordered a week's investigation for the charges against Camp Camp Kavanf, which took a whole sit-in.
Trump's press secretary, Sara Sanders, went to the Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding Rosstein's meeting with Rostin, he said: “No date is set, it could be this week for all the other aspects of the Supreme Court.
But let's see and I always want to tell the news."
Some journalists will oppose the statement, and there is no press in the White House after Sandras 10 September.
ranch Chris Wallace asked for his reason.
Sanders says it's not because they're upset with journalists, although he says: "I don't deny that they are showing people."
Then he suggested furthering direct contact between the camp and press.
"We've judged that number."
Brephing will also be in the future, Sanders says, "If the media gets the opportunity to directly question the U.S. President, it's better than to talk to me.
We've tried to do this, and you've seen us do this for the past few weeks, and you've been talking to the US president of the United States.
Temp regularly takes a regular question when he gets out of the White House or when he is engaging in the press conference with other guests.
One journalist conference is very low.
In New York this week, the press showed why, working, and sometimes reaching out to the journalist's group.

In his letter, Freeman writes: The discussion between Brexit throughout the summer continues to continue with EU and EU, hoping for the outcome.
However, the United States government is preparing her for the possibility of an unconstitutional agreement.
I know you're all going through a very anxious time.
That's why I just want to remind you of how precious their contributions to each member of the staff are to me.
The entire European Union and its colleagues have brought valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services and have benefited the patient and our community.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here."

The New York couple were accused of a New York couple's relationship to receive a confusing test from a mother who has been described as "argusting" because of the confusing test from a mother.
The couple refused to become a ethnic bully and asked for a case on "Juluum".
Two children's mother, Linsie Plasco-Flexman, expressed disappointment after her first day of work in 2016 that Gabriel Morris was a new watchmaker.
"Aaaaaaaaaaa" writes Mrs. Plasco-Felsman to her husband on a test text message.
Anyway, she sent her husband instead of Miss Morris, twice.
Later, she realized that the "wrong" Plasco-Felxman expelled Miss Morris, saying that their former grandmother, the African-American, expected Filipinos to work badly, expected to do a bad job, was reported in New York Post.
Miss Morris was given a day-to-day inheritance and then was sent home.
Morris is now accusing the couple's decision to obtain compensation and demand for six months as payment for six months, although he was first paid for his stay home without any contract.
"I want to show them, look, can't do that," he calls the post on Friday, and adds another partner, "I know it's inappropriate."
The couple said that they had a reasonable job to expel Morris from fear that they could not trust him after complaining about him.
"He didn't want to say what my wife sent.
He's not a racist.
We're not a ethnic terrorist couple," the husband told Joel Plasco post.
"But will you leave your children with someone who has treated you badly, even though it was wrong?"
Your sweet child?
Say it.
Plasco says about the charges of "Julum" was only two months ago that his wife gave birth to a baby and was in the midst of ‘a difficult situation".
"Would you like to go against someone like this?
It's not a good thing to do, that investment banker says.
In response to the legal case, public courts of the public condemned this couple’s behavior and reasoning in social media.
Padington’s publication fears that readers may not be able to contact the bear, publishing new documents.
Bund's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after being granted the book, said about the letter: “It's hard to tell what will happen the first time before the beginning.
After Padington's great success, it's very interesting to know.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the books of children from a bear, said that he refused his work and said he had the 60th anniversary of his death.
About Padington, which he described as “the most important member of our family,” says his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quiet man, and he wasn't a rich man," he said.
"The Padington was so real to him that your own child achieved any success: you're proud of him, even if there's no ground.
I think he saw the success of Padington in this way.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he himself always praised Padington.
My daughter was dead and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was soon taken to Nase Hospital, Louis Pasteur, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Ned regularly phoned that it was very bad, and that he wouldn't live," Mrs. Adnan-Lapoz said.
"Then I got Ned's phone and I knew he would die in two minutes and I was forced to say goodbye to him on the phone.
And I do.
I say, "Tish, Darling, I love you.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicine that the doctors gave to keep his heart on was gradually stopped working and going out of his body.
He died a while ago and then stopped.
I had no choice but to sit down, know everything.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold myself."
Mrs. Edan-Laperoz finally lamented his daughter's death, and moved on by other passengers - he was in a different position for this difficult situation.
Someone knows, he said.
"I was falling out of my eyes.
It's impossible to describe, but I'm sitting on the plane with Ned's impossible suffering.
That she needs my love and compassion.
I know how much he loved him.

Bret Kavanf's future questions to the future question of the FBI investigation.
"I thought that if we could give something to what he wanted - since it was limited to the investigation - we could probably bring some unity," Mr. Falke said on Saturday, saying that he was afraid that the committee might be "duced" in the face of this prejudice.
Why did Mr. Kavanf and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation?
Their duties are related to time.
On November 6, only five weeks left - if, according to hope, the Republicans reap bad consequences, they will become too weak to get people who like the highest court in the country.
George Bush has called Bush Senators and is urging them to support Mr. White House, who is working under Mr. Kavanf, who is working under Mr. Bush, his wife, was known for his personal interest in Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 are currently a Republican and 49 democracies.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kavanf can receive at least 50 votes at the Net, which can ensure that the vice-President Mike Wends is in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's opposition group is "cam" under Kim.
After Kim Jung-wun came to power seven years ago, the number of Koreans in North Korea has fallen short, saying that South Korea's law is a law code.
Park Beng-Segg, quoted South Korea's Union Ministry, says that last year the number was 1,127 - which was in 2011.
Mr. Park says the main reason is to pay strict control between North Korea and China and the human traffickers.
There was no public comment on Piyon Young.
A large number of migrants from North Korea have been granted citizenship to South Korea.
SUAL reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have fled China, with a long border with North Korea, and it is much easier than having a very safe zone between two Koreans.
China is, not as refugees, but as an illegal migrant and often forced them to return to their country.
The relationship between North and South Korea - still in the midst of the war - especially improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the mid-month, two country leaders gathered for discussion in Pyyongongong, where the center was the nuclear disarmament of the thum.
This has been followed by a historic meeting between President Donald Temp and Kim Jong-town in Singapore, when they agreed to work with nuclear weapons to create nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Re Yong-ho blames the US ban for progress.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. R. R. R., "Our national security will not be confidence in the United States, and in such circumstances we will not be unsatisfactory at first."
NCPOPIC BRIT BENWAYEF calls him "Hesteria-Groot", saying he is unable to take responsibility in the Supreme Court.
NHHOOC, leader of the Huussi Supreme Court, called No.C.O.O.M.T. B.C.O.C.E. B.C.E. to recognize the “Hestaria-grest” and said that he was in charge of the Supreme Court.
Pelocy Austin on Saturday, Texas, commented on an interview with Texas Trixon Festival.
“I can't imagine anyone would ever have done such a thing if he had ever done such a thing.”
Kavanf strongly denied the charges saying that he had sex with Dr. Christine Blaze when both of them were young.
During his initial statement, Kavanf was inspiring emotions, living his family and high school life, and breathing.
He openly condemned Democritts in the committee and accused him of a "dubacts and anti-communicial character" that was done by the 2016 presidential election.
Pelossi says he believes Kavanf's testimony that he is not worthy of the Supreme Court because he has proved that he is anti-communicated against Democratics.
"I think he's saying that he himself has proved impossible to himself in the way Clement and the Democrats rejected him," he said.
When he was asked if Kavanf was sure and if the Democratics would condemn him, Passi was asked if he would condemn him if they had received the majority of the House.
"I'll say that if he doesn't speak to Congress or FB, he's not only qualified to the Supreme Court, but rather that he's in the court where he's still in the court," Passi said.
Kanvanf is currently Judge of the C C.
Pelossi added that as a democracist, he was concerned that Kavanaf Afrog would oppose the Ark or the V. V. V., because he himself is a Conservative Justice.
In hearing his confirmation, Kavanf missed the question whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be allowed to be allowed to go to the court and tell us, 'It's not great,' Palossi said.
And women should control it.
It's a fair debate, months, and years of anger, and he can't remain crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mr. Steynm told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's Birl, what do you say?"
He also said, "I have helped a woman who was also angry, but she chose to cry when she started to cry when she started to cry when she started to cry, "You're feeling sorry, because I'm crying."
I'm really angry."
Then he went on.
I thought it was amazing.
The tears are part of the rage, because they are the victim of misunderstandings.
One of my first-time job memories is a man-in-gressing office, where I once saw myself crying in incredible anger, an elderly woman who was always afraid of me - who took me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," he said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see them."
Patrick Shirder, who worked with him for the Presidential Congressman of Colorado, was then working with him during the presidential election of Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught off the boat of Mankini Business in a foreign boat and got out of the struggle for the dirty work, Mij Shirdar thought there was no reason to be a candidate for his own president's wishes.
"It wasn't a very careful decision," he said to smile after 30 years.
"There are seven other candidates in the fight, and none of the candidates wanted.
One said to it, "Sno White and Seven Winds."
As soon as the campaign was delayed, he was back on the money collection, and so he vowed that he would not take up the race for 2 million dollars.
It was the battle of loss.
He saw that a supporter is only $250 when he was given $1,000.
"Do they think I'll get paid?" he exclaimed.
When he announced that he would not carry official preaching, he was deeply motivated by feelings and gratitude for his supporters, struggling to collect money, he pushed the voters away, and became angry about gender violence.
"You could've thought that I had been in Sannebu'a," says Miss Shredder, in memory of the news.
"You could have thought that Clinx was my Corporate Sponsor.
I remember, I thought they would bury me?
"He wept?"
How can the United States-Chibit war go with Beijing?
The first part of the US-Chinese commercial war was collapsing, and when the war finally ends, it can be useful in Beijing for the two countries, like experts.
The US President Donald Tempe first warned that during the beginning of this year, China’s main Rochesteres, including the Solar Panel, Esppo, and the Aluminium, were first warned to increase the increase in Chinese restaurants, including the China Raffini products.
The most outstanding answer was that this week, when about half of all imports from China, the amount of $250 billion (50 billion pounds) is set up, new dry.
Beijing has been dealt with as often as every time - they have recently increased from five to ten per cent on US dollars.
China has decided to fight with eyes and there is no possibility that the second largest economy in the world will soon be able to take eyes.
The demand for Washington's falling back, however, would be extremely insulting for China's president Shi Jinping, who lay his head to America publicly.
Nevertheless, experts say that even if Beijing can play cards properly, the pressure of the US commercial war can be positive in the long run.
"No quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can make the situation worse in both countries, which is much more dangerous than the concept of Wakibhahl's idea," Center for the New American Secretary for the New American Secretary of Security, Grace says.
Syria's "priest" says the foreign minister to take his refugees back.
Syria says that the country is ready to return to the refugees, and they have requested to rebuild the desolate state for seven years.
While speaking at the UN General Hospital, Foreign Minister Walyd Al-Mamalam says the situation is getting worse in the country.
"The situation is stable and secure today because of the progress that has taken place in the fight against demonstrators."
The government has continued to rehabilitate the natural conditions destroyed by terrorists.
The situation is all too difficult for people who are forced to leave their country because of terrorism and economic crisis.
The United Nations estimates that more than five million Syrian countries have fled since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people need human assistance.
Al-Mamullam says the Syrian government welcomes all help to rebuild the country.
However, he insists that there will be no conditions to be accepted or helped to the country’s advocates.
