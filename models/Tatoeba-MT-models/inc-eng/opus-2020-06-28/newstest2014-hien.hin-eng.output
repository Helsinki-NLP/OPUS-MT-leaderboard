Black box in your car?
While the U.S. street planning is struggling to improve the crash system, many people are seeing the solution in the tiny black box on your car's dashboard.
The device which is driven by motor-Correators and communicates to the authorities today has become a controversial attempt to destroy the old U.S. major streets of the United States and state planning office.
Usually, such as hibernation's initiatives have become the point of an unexpected debate and biodiversity.
In order to keep details of the drive, and probably use this information to create the tax bill - with the Libyan international groups supporting support for allowing the government to allow the blackbox to use these blackboxs.
Tea party is dangerous.
The U.S. citizen freedom organization is also very concerned with various kinds of privacy issues.
While Congress could not agree whether or not, many Kingdoms are not waiting for further action.
They're searching for how they can go into the system in the next decade to pay for every mile that is set on the street.
Thousands of cars have already taken the blackbox for test drive, some of which have gPS. monitoring.
It's really essential for our country.
"It's not about to be selected or not by us," says Hasan Iktar, director of the South California government, who is planning to launch every carker in California by 2025.
There's going to be a change in how to pay by us.
It's technology to do so.
The main reason is that the country's High Trust Fund has become almost lights, which is paid by the US-positive citizens.
Americans don't buy any gas first.
Now the car moves in a Galen gas more than before.
There was no increase in the last 20 years, which was 18.4 cents per Galen.
Because of the high value of gas, politicians refrain from increasing any money in tax tax.
"You are not a person."
Their Kingdom has recently set up a tracking device in 500 cars to examine the per-million payment system.
They say, "It will work as the most reasonable option in times."
The vonx calls it Michaelas-based user Salk.
It is not surprising that this idea is good for city liberalists, since it can be turned into taxing as a car for example, which can help reduce weights and lower levels of Greenhouse gas.
California's plans are eager for this system while they are developing the strategy to achieve the goals set in the government's capital Global Voices rules.
But the president of the House Transport Committee, Rapp. Bill Sushster (A.P.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.) also consider the Black Box the Best Reward.
Freedom vendors in the Republic are also in the side of every mile payment by the driver.
Adrian Moore, the vice president of the Policy in Regene, said: "It's not just doing what is going on in the blind."
People are paying more clearly for what they're getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former American traveling Secretarys who have been able to go forward with Congress from Congress in 2011.
U.S.net approved the investigation project of 90-million dollars last year, including 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural methods, represented by individuals who had to go to work or go to the city for a lot of miles, the leader of the party ended up there.
Yet many kingdoms and cities are moving forward this way.
It is one of the most attractive Orgoans, listed by 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest use.
These drivers will soon pay for the kingdom instead of using it.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing trucks on a limited basis.
And I-95, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Florida), is studying how they can perform this change.
This idea was not found support on all places.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteered cars were placed on cars of the device, drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor every move.
"The big problem was that the Big Brother and other types of things that led to the Newwada transport department, Aloudin Khan, who said: "The big issue was the concern of the brain and other things."
It's not something people wanted.
As soon as the test went forward, the NC.L.U warned on its website: "Put this device into the entire tracking device is easier to change."
There is no need to develop a massive, unconstitutional technology structure, which must be spread in order to keep each individual's daily presence.
Navada is among many of the countries that are trying to achieve the potential technology, with help the Kingdom can get a description of how many miles the car's running every day, but not where and when she's going.
Khan said, "If you can do this, people can feel more comfortable."
The discovery of this technology led to some state agencies to bring to the small caliberia called Trau Meleez.
The campaign wasn't originally in business to help the drivers rule.
This was trying to get into the market on the top of the Auto Bema, which was supposed to pay the drivers on their missiles.
But the device that is testing was good because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information that is being uploaded at the time.
Ryan Morrison, the chief authority of Trau Miles, said: "If you follow the footsteps of the people, you will not be able to track them."
These early programs of the state have made a lot of mistakes.
There are too little expense and less contraception methods to do this.
In Organ, plans are using different options to provide.
They can choose gPS devices without nor nor with gps.
Or any device may be selected no more than that of any device, but that of the average money given by the inhabitants of the kingdom.
Other places hope that the device can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more facilities rather than by lowering the device.
In New York City, Transportators are attempting to develop a taxing device, which will also contribute to paying the parking cursor, "for your drive", will provide a collection of real time data that can be used to save motor-calculus traffic.
The city's organization mentions, "Mutor-Cortains are interested in participation in the benefits."
However, some airline plannings wonder that the whole discussion on payment may be extremely risky.
The Mechanical Transport in San Francisco Bay said that growth in the Congress gas taxi can be very easy to deal with by increasing the problem of the South East Trade Fund.
The Hybrids can also be placed on a single-time or a year, with vehicles which do not use too much gas so they can pay their proper share.
Randy Rynthsler, director of the event and public affairs, said, "What is needed to do with the espresso when it can work."
If we do so, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.

Snow-dressing with Germany on the American square
Edward Snow Den, American Secretary of the Press, has announced that Berlin is ready to travel to Germany to give proof of the issue in Germany if the U.S. National Security Agency and its Director Kitit Alexanders have failed to respond to their activities.
German M.P. Christian Street Belle, met Mr. Snow Debber in Russia, where he was given refuge, to speak about the witness in Germany.
Sansand said in a letter by Mr. Snow Den on Friday: "But the results of my efforts are positive, my government considers chaos as changing, and no one provides protection that attempts to justify political speech with the charges of the mobs."
However, telling the truth isn't a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snow Den said that he believed that he could assume the support of the international community against them the U.S. government.
The U.S. justice department includes secret and secret theft from the government's property.
Hans Peter Friedrick, the minister of German internal affairs, told the online Zeit: "Oh, Mr. Snow Den is ready to talk to German authorities, so we're going to find ways to make it possible."
The connection between the U.S. and Germany has been under pressure because NSA claimed that the NSA has launched a call for the Chancellary Engel.
Thomas Orman, who is president of the Federal Association, oversees the information. He said that if Mr. Snow Denen would have been the opportunity of "response with Americans and bring them into danger," it should also be taken as an opportunity.
Mr. Straw Bay, a breath of the Green Party of Germany, published a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter.
He was on his journey to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Stroo Belle said, according to the NSA lawyer, if they leave Russia, Sno Den Rus is not able to go back.
If Snow Den Nimri gave a witness in Germany, she would be "safe" who would need assurances that would be needed, Sansand.
Mr. Snow Den said in his letter that "they had to face them and continue campaigning" had to be forced to leave home.
However, he said that they are happy and motivated by global global response" to their work of political expression.
The United States - including the United States - high - high officials have come to the secret of a massive public service system.
The letter promotes a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when human situation has been solved."
Frontery Airlines Carry - On Baggas will turn on
The plan is to charge $100 to store stuff for your passengers on your plane board in the Fronter Airlines.
Frontier Airlines is planning to launch a car-on bag for $1, and it'll make up $2 for coffee or release, though, to announce on Wednesday that passengers can keep the whole box.
The new car-on is for the bag in overhheads, so the little bag under the seat will be dry again.
Frontier said that $25 will pay if AIDS is paid, $100 will wait if the passengers wait to pay until they are on the gate.
Frontier Kate O'Malley said he'd have to take care of the surgery in the power of $120 passengers.
"We don't want to pay him," he said.
Airlines started operating for the first and second test bag in 2008.
The passengers who are trying to escape are trying to do as they can in the cariary-on bag, which is often in the Overhhead database.
One way to get less for passengers on the board.
O'Malley said it's not really about gambling.
It has become very hard to find the location of overhead Bin about the Fronter.
It doesn't have to give the passengers who buy tickets to their own website of Erline.
That means that the next person in line could pay 100 dollars to a similar bag, while a passenger on line can get a bag free.
O'Malley said that the software and check processes of the factory are being changed before they get the gate to make sure the passengers know about twenty.
The new Carrier's new factory will not start until summer, though a date has not been specified.
Travelers often show disrespect for the babge shells and others, but they like the plane service.
They argue that it costs money to handle the bag, and those who want travel should pay for it.
The fees on Wall Street have been seen as a sign that many Airlines are operating enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of disaster.
Most of the caribous are not even covered.
Stirit Airline Inc. began three years ago, and the partner client Algegant Aires started three years ago.
In addition to such a fine, the Wiz of the other Airline Hungary is the Wiz of the Airlines Director, who said the Airlines Director, Sorensen, and who's track-on fissy.
He brings up $50 million in a year in December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former officer of the Midwest Airlines recently flying and passengers have had to cope with carri - an unusual bug on the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my Airline career," he said.
I expected to see the teeth and a battle gate.
"He was full of energy and he said he offered it as a liquefy-screw."
Frontier also follow coffee, tea, or two of Spatty's $2 cents for Zeus.
Frontist Vahan, who leaves a passenger or a guy, can keep the whole box, and this release will only be given for once.
It'll still take away the water.
In 2008, US Airways tried to charge for drinking products, but they turned back seven months after the fact that they were there and no other other major Airlines were there.
Frontier's passengers do not buy directly from the airlines, so Frontiger's step is to charge credit on the cariators to his own website.
Airlines pay online traffic vendor for $10 to $25 each of the tickets.
That's why all Airlines have been encouraged to buy passengers directly instead of going through an online traffic agency.
Frontier, though, has gone further in this area.
Many times in September, the flight was half on the way to the remote shift for customers who bought an online travel agency from these people.
It cut to 25 percent of the trucks.
So, a thousand miles from an online traffic agency would release a 1,000 miles [150 km] trip.
They also allow users to choose their seat in the first place when buying directly from the Frontier website.
There's a loyal interest in customers in the city of Denver in Frontier, but it's getting low and it's losing money.
9 percent of the drop in the kingdom and its ability to fly have been reduced to 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the report, by the Corporate Perpre Repic Representative Press Holdings Ink.
Trying to determine the sale of Fronter as part of the Republic Airlines sale.
The NSA accused the "internal Error" instead of the Web crash to be crashed.
The official national security agency told Friday that our website had been closed for hours because of some technical lack of technology, not because of Hackers, as some people claimed online.
In the moment of sending email, Zefaia agency said, "It wasn't until NSA.gov.gov didn't reach many hours, which caused an internal error in pre-depending."
This problem will be solved tonight.
It's not true that this ban was due to the distribution of service [DD.S.].
In the evening the online server tracker found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and that site is still not accessible for some users.
The NSA spokesman said to the ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network, was "not even a "satisfy" with the N.C.A.N.
The president said no classal instruction is in danger.
At least one hackist group has claimed that they are responsible for blocking the NSA websites via DAD.D.S.A.
The D.D.S. attacks are designed to be designed so much as traffic is sent to the website, until the server is closed.
This is predictable, and the aim of attacks is not to reveal internal networks of the system.
Former-pre-presidious NSA, sometimes named "not an agency", has become a subject of discussion and criticism between foreigners and home-identists in front of the events of the past month - ads which are equally common to common people - from NSA. N.A.A.A.S.A.A.A.S.A.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.S.S. has been known as "noon.N.S.A.S.A.A.S.A.
Because of this growing issue of agency, such arrests were made after tonight's events that were the result of the careful cyber operation.

The plane ship and train in Canada's Bombrdier Inc reported on the loss of 15 percent in pure profit, as pressure on its train in the third quarter in the United States and on emergency issues.
Montreal-based Bombrard also offered an update of any flights to his brand new Csideris planes or planes to complete his prestigious program from the next September.

Camaran Dorson, a analyst with the National Bank Fainary, has reduced his rating to Guerrer's "counter" from the "counter performance" is limited over the next or the next one or two ways.
"Morjour would expect most of the airport delivery, we clearly feel disappointed by the marionette performance, "Dorson said in a client note.
We will receive a new order for the Bumber CSeries as the progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are announced in months, undoubtedly the market program will be destroyed.
Bombard expects the plane family can cut it at the end of Boing and Airbus market.
The first test was suspended in the plane March and was flying for the first time in September after the delay.
Possible Kreather new jetliner waits for the results of flights to recognize the consequences of flight to the company's prices on survival and potential cost, but as is the case with the firm order for CSersess up to 177 to 177.
15 customers and 403 total order and dependencies are available with the operators and the operators.
The Chief Minister Pierre Baudin believed the Bombrdier would fulfill his 300 standard order target since bringing the jets of commercial use.
The authorities assured the media that the program was acting according to the schedule.
"The experiment plane remained at the ground for a long time compared to the pre-preference," Bodoin said in a conference call, adding that it also added land testing and software updates during the end of a software update.
Every maker makes a schedule in a different way.
We have decided to take a first flight and make an update and say what we did.
That'll all be through that flight program.
With the rest of five pilots' other parts shortly after, with the following, hopes to fly in the coming weeks, the company said.

Georgia's teenage parents believed their son had been murdered in "an unexpected accident"
A young girl from Georgia, whose dead body was found in her high school course, believes that their son was murdered by his son, the minister of the family.

They don't have any confidence in death in the way Sheriff told them.
Camp said that "they think this is from physical laws and common sense."
They think it's a excuse for the safety of the responsible person or people to the death of their son.
He sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag.
U.S. Prime Minister Michael Michael Mazar said to the teacher that he's checking an official investigation on Johnson's death, seeing many important questions are answered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder due to a crime?
Murray said these words to a journalist at a meeting in Thursday.
I will follow the facts. Let them lead us wherever I go.
My purpose is to bring the truth in front of me.
He said, "I think there are environmental reasons for an official investigation."
Murray told the reporter that the initial funeral test was due to Johnson's death as a result.
According to Morse, a different reason for death was found in a second funeral test."
They said: "If indeed thou dost ask a number of questions, or can it be that we speak the truth?"
Morrie also said that if he finds enough testimony to divorce a criminal in the case of Johnson's death, or to investigate the public rights, he will say to him to do it.
The chairman was not immediately available to comment from the office of Londez Contrifi's office on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the Judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to continue all surveillance videos that were reviewed by the investigators.

The parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children's 'digital'
Germany has become the first country in European Union, which has approved third gender for children born with unexplained population.
No longer will be specified for the newborn children in a formal way.
According to the new law, parents don't need to announce gender for such children, the law allows them to declare sex on the birth of a child’s birth or to declare “undistinguishable” or “depressive”.
The purpose of the new law to reduce pressure on parents who can quickly make a decision regarding gender-dependence for newborn children, and have to fight discrimination against the children.
According to B.B.C., an interactive person said years later, "I am a man, not a woman."
I'll make a box made by Chittis.
According to estimates, one child is out of 2,000 children every year, and no child is born.
They are intersects, part of the group of about 60 cases of sexual development, which comes under a series of test tests of sexual development, which is used to be used for unusual properties, genetics, genetics (or generation), or unusually developed gender.
Well, it might be Vallis Simpson's having an interface.
The gender identity is still not considered properly, but most experts in the United States believe it is better to use the best information when the gender is not able to be specified and the child's best information, if such an incident comes to monitor the mental and physical development of the child before the child's development.
In New York City's psychologist Dr. Jack Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. in the case of gender-possing, he said that the new law of Germany seems to appear "good."
Intersex children create moral issues.
He said, "Some people are in a situation similar to the need for medicine, but most of the children don't."
You can specify the gender without a cure, and then see how it develops.
Science is not very reasonable to know how a child will develop a gender.
No one can answer the right answer about it.
It's a kind of puzzle that people are gay.
In 2011, the European Commission's survey of the European Commission has been described as different from people with transsexuals or transgender, since their position is not related to gender but is clearly related to the biological structure that is not either male or female, either by male or by both of them.
These features can display themselves in secondary sexual activities, such as weight weights, hair distribution of hair, breast and length; primary sexual orientation; primary sexual orientation; or oral sex skills; or quality structure and Hormono.
The report also provides a basis for lions regarding the discrimination, violence, violence, and discrimination faced by Internet and Transnder people.
Now there are special camps for non-uniforming girls.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark older people on their official documents as men, women, or "the third gender".
In June 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Wube, after the legal appeal for life, the world's first unsatisfied "duced" apps were the world's first legislator.
According to the Internal Ministry, there will also be a third definition for Internet people except M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, issues involving gender in neighboring countries are still controversial.
In 2011, by the year 2011, the French legislators have signed the Essex to return from the University's books to "Ling principle" from the University's books.
The U.S. website Catholic online has also opposed the law of Germany, saying, "When the world is going to go into a state where sex is chosen, but not sexual activity, we are taking two and three columns in opposite direction."
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn baby also told the Baby Jann that she would like to see the child being specified when she was born.
He said on the website of raising children: "It's extremely stressful, especially if you don't know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and determination.
Historically, children born with both men and women born with genetics were called Hermipharades, who were in the name of a beautiful Greek god who was considered bilingual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered gender as a syllable that could be destroyed and written again.
But now many people are challenging the morals of hygiene, they realize that the gender-exposure work is complicated, and sometimes even medical professionals, who don't know what the children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
Drish says "in the middle of the 20th century, it was called "morongues".
When these children were born, you didn't call psychologicalists, you called me Shaul-Chitist.
The current principle about treatment of babies with unsanitary genetics was presented by Dr. John Hepkins University, Dr. John Mani, who considered gender to be ideal.
He designed the word "ling identities" and reasoned how social and environmental sign - how parents raise children - determinedly with the baby's genes and Hormones that he should be recognized as a man or a woman.
But in a case known as "John/Joan" in 1966, their principles became controversial.
He was a child whose sexual leggrgrroom-house-of-faced, recommended to his parents to release the baby’s egg and give it its red-pare girl like a red-paan girl.
She said, "My mother has presented the matter as a success issue, but it didn't happen."
At 15 years of age, the child turned himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drishr said that some doctors are still "following the image."
But with the arrival of the Internet in 1990 in the years following the 1990s, the people who went to the front of the Ling Chechnya-Subs began to "not be happy with grace."
The same case was with the 36-year-old author Jim Bruce of Montena, who was born with X.Y. properties, but his engagement was unattainable.
Doctors didn't clearly understand that his gender was small, or his confusion was large, but they were sure he could never live as a man.
So shortly after she was born in 1976, Bruce's right body and an ovarian medicine was removed and his child was raised as a girl.
She was given a woman Herrmon in the age of 12.
He said to ABC News.com, "I know I'm not a girl."
I wasn't happy, but question was very difficult.
At 18 years of age, she was going to be a veneeroplastic with her.
But feeling helpless and confused, he asked for medical records.
That made him aware of the terrible truth.
I was married when I was born - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., who prevented his body from creating enough teststones, which could not have developed properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man, he took a piece of Tesstenron and removed his breast.
Because of her condition, she lost her mind.
Today, he teaches people to make their views general about interfeses in the Interface Project.
However, the legal group of California-based Avevocates for Infractions for Infractions Human Rights expressed concern that Germany’s law "science and corruption" invite."
They say, "Many activists think that Germany’s law will move parents to make immediate decisions and to give the child a "depressed"
We're afraid this will encourage the intervention.
Instead of waiting, it's better to specify man or woman-in-law.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Mattis said that his organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to recognize in the third gender."
He said, "The elderly should be able to make their own decision about the domestic gender."
The German law is related to specifying it at birth.
It's not the war against newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions related to their body.
But the Chinese radioist Dr. Erlen Bartz, whose daughter is a teenager, helped hundreds of other people in support group, said that Germany’s law would give both parents and children “power”.
Beatriz's daughter was born with men who were born with properties, but she was a full Adrogen anesthetic organization called D.D.
Since her Adorn Granze was wrong, women were developed in Katty.
In her body there is Ginin but not abortion or dedigition.
The 29-year-old Kat is married and is registered in the Child Psychological Department at the Pencil University of Pennsylvania.
Though she's barren, she expects to be a mother through shots or Gestaposel Sargasi.
He said, "This law allows parents to make their own decisions soon."
It provides them with a proper understanding and time to understand and write 'men' before they write 'men' or 'mila'.
Thus, you live well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely baby and enjoy it.
We don't need to make a quick recovery that cannot be returned.
They said: "This is the process of bringing children to the process of decision, and that parents should free their parents from the worry that they do not believe."
Finally, the child will determine what kind of sex he is -- and that would be very good.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
A legal guard in the middle of Raiman and Ramangar, head of Tashal Leslal Services Commission, was held in Radman and Rammangar's Middle School School Camp.
The students and others were given information about the law for education and economics.

Report: Think of the Binding Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to New York Times, nearly 30 percent of President Barack Obama’s experts were quietly thinking about Hitler’s position at the position of the U.S. President Bardein for 2012.
The most outstanding threat in the secret conference is Mark Haffner and John Heleman's heavy 2012 campaigner Tom, "Dear Down Down on 2012".
Times received a copy of the Amadami book and told Thursday that the president's top president’s top advocates can help to find Polming again in 2011.
According to Time’s National Political Dialoger Jonathan Martin, the book has full knowledge of efforts and efforts in the campaign of the main authorities and lay the foundations of the White House for the name, the head of the former White House, to learn what impacts the change from the former Secretary of State Centin.
The possible changes were a very secure secret within the basic structure of Chicago campaign and inside the Oval Office.
With only half-registers, Obamma campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House vice president, David Alexler and David Palfoffe, knew that the change of the change was inconsequential.
The "Dbal Down" claimed to change Bindin, but they tried to make their information finally before they finally informed them of their decision that the client's ticket would not improve the situation of Obama's ticket.
In an interview with Martin, Ray has confirmed that the administration was actually thinking about the place of Clinton with Bindin.
"I looked at the whole view, and said, one of them, it was," said the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the president was in danger of the president's office, and we were in such a way: "The holy Christ, the Christ, what will we do?"
While Tara pointed out that as "teacher to Richardson's CNN", Martin told Enderson Cooper that the election campaign was once more important to find how much the price would be paid to find it.
"The campaign doesn't spend the votes and attention groups until they think seriously about something," Martin said on Ess360.
It's obvious, Holki, or Obama knew that their team was looking for changes.
Martin told the CNN that he asked if his boss knew the possible change?
While Tanya said "they don't think the president knew of the potential change"," the former Chief of Staff admitted that Obama knew it.
"Doable Down" is certain: Wouldn't answer if political investigations reached Obama's desk?
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama did not know about Dampling Research.
"Well," said Martin.

Though I'm his taste is very good.
Apne is known for unusual taste, including used companies, beer, cheese, meat and gold.
But his next design is going to prove even more noble.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is natural impossible because of snow crystal that makes ice cream behaves, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
ice cream is used by a jellyfish, used by Chinese scientists

George Carver: Euro Wonttt gave a choice to Scotts
Another day, fear of freedom was another story.
This time we have been warned that the terms of EU's subscription will require independent Scotland to join the independent travel area throughout Europe as a whole.
Birvik points to stories about the control of passports and hardyra walls.
The truth is that the Stethclide paper describes the potential economic benefits of independent exchanges with other Europe, even though it did not describe it in pre-dependence.
Nor anyone described that EU users spend most of their time changing their official laws according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer in the field, Bruce'sss will will always be available for non-unnuendated blogs instead of getting whatever he wants from Scotland.
So, then, uh-oh.
And the thing that caught so long has been gathered, first I've heard about the port control of Pakistan nearly 40 years ago.
Still, the interesting story was lost to hear it again.
Why should independent Scotland expect Europe to be divided?
Why would London's judiciary have to be crisscrossed, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great, war-style plan to organize Europe is finally halted.
With Euro disaster, the project has been officially dead.
In entire EU, dedicated teams are getting strong enough to stop Euro as opposed or equal currency.
Even in Germany, Europol Alterov for the German Front Party - which has been founded this year - suddenly came and received nearly five million votes in the Central election of September, and this way out of free Democrats (our personal library databases).
The plan to build the Union Europe has always been a challenge.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be a disastrous change.
In addition to the harsh laws imposed by Berlin and European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project has gone far away.
There was no greater role in Euro's disaster in the worst of the national government's losses - such was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Euro system established its members in favor of German exports - something that wants to keep German political.
Without the possibility of a domestic price, South Europe has found itself in an incalculable condition of production compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce the wages and public spending - which is encouraged by Berlin.
A deep European product is a patient who is no longer in the process of starting budgets and currency problems.
French and German power firms at the cost of consumers - resulting from the "greed" energy policies, the European Union paid double and four times for power compared to the United Nations.
It's the loss of a pinhead, which we've already seen in Grigmamouth.
Even in the world all paybacks can't be affected by the European Petrocoms industry by S.S. Shell Gas.
As a result, people are outraged by rebellion, especially in France, who was once a prime fan of EU.
France's top politicians saw EU control of Germany, and Paris as a way to provide as a way to provide as full-fundishing support in the world.
But Berlin does not need Paris as a passport for political integrity, and it has applied its own economic policies in Europe, causing France’s economy to disappear.
The result is that the U.S. National Front has recently won a third-class championship in the U.S. subsidiary.
At this time, the most popular group in France with 24 percent of the votes - it's a critical warning for British Leber that they can't walk out of the way to the left, to the right.
Le Pen French bullets, what are they doing with their new fame in the middle of the working class?
The team wants to use the EU elections in the European Convention to create an EU anti-government, all-faithful opponents.
If so, as far as it is possible, the EUss show good displays in these choices, this kind of code can affect the European constitution for the first time.
My view is this: Soon in Europe, the EU will end the EU and the most loyal opposition of the EU.
Euro won't be completely finished, but it's going to come back to Europe like "Urter" of the nations which will support General de Gale.
Germany and some of its traditional economy can keep Euro, but France and South Europe will re-enter their currency.
I hope the U.S. will keep the U.S. itself away from this project.
However, the growing interest in the maggotton in Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland next?
We can choose to be the territory of Little England (socially).
Or we can protect our own financial interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brazil to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do a better job in the drying European system, believing we should keep our own currency.
It would be easier to work with other people of non-Islamic nations in Europe.
Otherwise we should think about keeping our financial freedom in the way of Norway.
In Scotland, the S.N.P. has been described as the most successful anti-communicative campaign in Europe, which is proposed by Albert's Chancellor Elsier Darling and later on on the basis of the Torrlieb de Damement in 2011.
It'll be exciting to vote for freedom for Scotland right now, because in that situation it will accept the law of the Militian and Brazil.
Before Time Evan: Getting Biger
Research shows that African-American and Spanish girls get sex at the age of their age younger girls.
Physical change does not mean that sexual intimacy is close
There is no evidence that Hormones or any other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that stress can be a factor in a low life - style
The case of sex before time is not as effective as boys
Former reporters of CN.A. are the health and family journalists in the health and family issues of pets.
Should the mother be concerned, if his daughter is born at 7 or 8 years of age and has to start developing and producing a baby’s hair?
This week, at the annual conference of the American Child Medical Academy in Florida, Florida, Child Medical Academy Dr. Paul Kpolovitz made it clear that these original physical changes are common among American American girls.
"I spend a lot of time-time commitments to the actors - usually not showing progress in the direction of full recreation."
It's already seen in the hair and the hair of the hair and the physical smell girls like the apparent symptoms of development.
But in the last four decades, a major change has taken place.
In the United States, the average age is 125 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast begins to grow, the first of two years takes place," he says, "is at least two years ago, which is the time-old Yunnan: the writers have to deal with this common problem."
It's time for the most accurate investigation of the development of the biodiversity.
The beginning of youth is debate about what happens, but when breast development with breast development before 8 years of age, it's called "bal-old".
In most cases this process will be slow or stopped - which child medicine can be closely monitored.
In the situation of more rapid progress, the end of the dynamite may need to be tested by the end of the dynamite so that serious problems such as untommes or stests can be solved.
The treatment is to delay the time-to-dos and other consequences: the time-old age-of-life increase, which may lead to an immobilized growth and aging.
Thanks to the drug or Hormones treatment, child age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional growth.
Mentalistic aspects are also important.
Capology has been published about medicine but accepts, "The pressure to press on can increase positive points, and girls may feel separated from their peers."
Another major problem may be to understand: Parental not only wants their young daughter to be a patient.
She said, "They are concerned about the risks of the pregnancy." She said, "How can we keep clean?"
A woman whose daughter had started the magazine when she was 10 years old recalls, "It was a shock".
Although this was a sign of the fact and we even talked about medicine, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She was afraid of her school and upset that she had started the first magazine religion in her classmates.
There are very well-known principles about the causes of so-called sexuality.
Still, there is no constant witness that Hormono can be accused of sexual messages in the domestic, or media in milk or other food products.
The kids are getting the same time-time sex as girls.
The Caplatives determines that it is the main cause of stability.
He helped to conduct studies over 6 to 9 years of age in 2001, linking the body to the period of sexual activity.
Other results support the conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Spanish girls are tempted to get sex before their young girls.
This is a lot of explanations.
On global level, the image of time-old wine, from economic conditions to weather and genes, appears to be influenced by all things.
Other puzzle: even though children are getting the hair and the hair of their hair at the age of age, the girls are not as clear as girls are.
Other medical experts who attended the AAP conference supported the subject.
Even in the eyes of the children, and in the ears of the children, the hair of the beast is become a common sight.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginning of the yurcessance at Garreb Children's Hospital, Dr. Lawrence Silverman says: "We need to be careful about how we start online."
Parents should not be surprised to consult their child with their child doctor in order to think about it.
Caplativez recommended, "This means having to talk before expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.
From time to time, this trust needs to be reassured that even if it's been earlier, it's part of normal life.
The fight was dropped in temperatures 3.1 degrees Celsius.
The rain and the cold came by night, and the wind made the people feel cold.
The mighty men put their hands on the battlers, and went out toward the marketplace, and toward their destination.
The first rain of the winter has also been taken away.
In the morning people came to see the sun.
The weather changes are also a source of relief to the old and sick, but then it continues to continue to warm up all day long.
The children also came to their school by wearing sweaters.
There, according to the Air Force Weather Department, the maximum temperature of the wave is 25.1 degrees Celsius and at least 13.7 degrees Celsius.
While 7.8 mmmt rain was dropped.
The clouds will still appear in the sky according to the weather department.
A dispute for seat width was on the top of the largest order of the jet manufacturers.
This month's two-month disputes have become a shock between the surfaces of the flight seats of tourists.
The debate is centered on the width of the seat of the Economy class in a long flight, not always by Erlines, but by the position assigned to Lott Jobs Ebbs and Boining Company.
Erbes, this week at least 18 inches (64 cm) of Economy’s largest seat in the Economy cabin (64 cm) has the hope of a standard, but it must be determined by Errlines.
The dispute between the plane manufacturers occurred when the large engines of Ercroft, a long distance from 17-21, were sold.
How has the last section of the plane been created - especially whether seating is 9 or 10 as equal to that of Minni Janbo jets's design in perspective?
Boeing says it's created "777 X" that will place 406 people in 17 inches and 10 in a row.
Airbus says it's going to take 350 people to 18 inches [18 cm] to the seat with A350.
The plane’s speed is often seen on technical matters by advertising commercial press.
Now, there's hope to be more than 100 yards in the double of the Airbs 777 X with the Aerbis X, which is going to be released to public.
It's been recently seen as something starting from the beginning of the war, showing Fincino with it, would you accept it together in a restaurant together?
Erbes sales chief John Lei said "injin Region Turbo is also driving long distances in the camps."
As a change, people are getting better, but the way to sit is not different.
According to data from the U.S. health department, between the 1970 ’ s and the 1970 ’ s when Boingbo described modern travel ke, Taha, and an average of 40 - year - old American male weights.
According to American Health Statistics, the average American man in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.7 cm.
Iberbes says it's against a seat-set of 1950 when the average compass of the new name "jet set", says Irbis.
Earbes says they've established the Research Commission which suggests a further step in the width of the seat to improve the quality of sleep during the 5320s of sleep in the quality of sleep.
Boing argued on the air line measure, and said that it does not depend on the decision of the Creator’s creations.
It also says that the research indicates that the length of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin's experience more than the width of a seat.
Boing’s expert, Kevin Krecker said, "It really is to provide airliners and believe what they need to do to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us what they're doing."
They know better than anyone else.
It's about a cohesive room, but it's a quick point for officials that can affect I.
At least 700 billion dollars behind the debate, it is sufficient in the last decades to republished in American and European exports.
The first time in July, what seat layout is really the point of fighting between the new jet planes.
Erebs and Boing claimed 20 percent of the seats have been processed in their newly connected engine design, compared to 365-Citt Boing 777–300 E.
The claim to being depends on the 1077 X plane compare with the 777 basic design.
10 times equal to the benefit of the unit.
Kevin Cantstein, a European eberbes passenger's head says, "This is our plane, with our products, and more resistance to more seats."
On the other hand, the analysts say the whole 10-C-bit-line cable for the present 777 S suggests that many passengers are on the side of the Daener Lout, which can go along with the satir.
Kubin inside expert My Kirby, the founder and editor's online girl network said "it will be very good for the seat widths of the eighteenth inch, but the fact that this business point of Erebs is conducted by the threat of the threat of 777"
Airbus and Bogg seats don't pass, but they're providing a list of agents to choose for the Airlines.
The jet vendors around the world will also handle carefully to check this Leitos competition.
More comfortable, all Builders are offering high- density levels for low-speed flight services and regional travel.
It's a 10 times A350 but says it's not sold yet.
However, while recently, Erbis stressed some of its jet seat seats to need more cabin facilities.
Without support for modern jet planes, a new project is not possible, but it can drive down 777 X sales waves without support from other designers of modern jets.
New anti-antiton vaccine can finish smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-kotin vaccine, which can end the funnels coming from smoke.
One of the herbs, the rats, were able to protect themselves from the use of nitoin for whole life.
The man needs further tests before he starts testing, which may take several years, but in New York, Professor Rond Clerle said that strange signals are positive.
Professor Cornwell said, "We hope this kind of vaccine can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the ways in the market today, but they found that their strength is even stronger than they are."
The new vaccine has a damaged virus that is designed to produce an anti-intactivism information with the purpose of creating anti-kontin anti-tactivism.
The virus transmits the selected cells, which then begins to form a permanent hole of the antibody.
Antibates search for any neurotranslators in blood, and prevents the formation of nicotine from rise within the body before they get into the brain before they reach into the brain.
In test, the vaccines that were later given, continued their normal activity.
The researchers say, but the chicken that had not been given vaccine was a sign that Nicotine had come to his brain.
The use was described in the journal Science.
In the past Tambaku's vs failed because they had anti-bates.
It had to be repeated on regular intervals so that the anti-identity level was formed, but it proved to be expensive and unrecognizable.
But the price of new vaccines is expected to be too much, since the genetic cells will make an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before smoking, to protect them from nicotine.
But it probably will be used by people who smoke themselves.
He said, "They will find out that if they resurfaced smoking again, they will have no joy because of nicotine's vaccination, which can help save their habit."
British scientists pointed out the results as interesting, but warned of the need to find more.
Even after the postmarmum, Baghin could not rise again because of the real cause of his death.
The Green Department is the first to tell the death of the Babalin in response to Gomoll’s response to the issue.
On Thursday night, the animals of Ramgare forest were found to be a corpse of a tiger near the plain of Rizv near the river.
All the bodies of the tiger were safe, and there was no injury or injury on her.
On Friday on Friday, Van Hydalla, CTR's foreign-free conscience, CTR's foreign sit-in-in-law, DFOO Nasim, the SDO GS Carcakes of CTR's Animals in the presence of CTR, and the remains of the tiger’s animal gutters in the presence of the tiger.
The values of the constellations are being told that during postmarum the internal corpse was damaged.
This did not identify the reasons for the real death of the tiger.
The circuit officials were responding to the death of the tiger.
Yet Ivira's internal organs have been restored to the apposcialized test to confirm the safety of the tiger.
The forest protected Western conscience said that the death of the tiger can be called natural.
The corpse of the tiger has no symptoms.
Still, the area around it is being sent to the Bisrah check for confirmation as well.
Tripodi denies us being affected by Obid.
The former NSW company Minister J.R.R. will be tested by State Corpson Watch.
The former NSW company Minister J.T.R.T.T. has refused to submit to the request of his political teacher Adame Obid, former New South Wales, to hide in three land controlled by the government.
On Friday (ICC) further check on Friday, if Mr. Obid from several state ministers to a portion of the rules of the rules of the rules? Where two restaurants and cafes of Obama, without received permission, were completed in August 2005.
Lin Assley, after the news given to Thursday by the former Chief of Staff, Mr. Tripoli knew the secret of Mr. Obid, is now being tested?
During the years of the discussion in 2005, the government forced public banners to start the bars.
The traitors were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the entry of the press for the bars, which Obid spent $5 million a year, was released from the Tander without bars.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the prime minister of the village from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favor of Public Temple.
But they refused to change on Mr. Obid's request, Mr. Tripoli urged the government policy to change.
In a phone call, quoted in August and September 2007, Mr. Obama and Mr. Tripoli and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the office after serving the port office
Assistant Anthony Waheley asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the telephone conversation on the business issue of business affairs?"
"No," Mr. Tripoli answered.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obid.
The authorities say that Israel’s warship was running out of Syria.
The Israeli battleship planes set up the port of Lácaria on Thursday night, a senior official confirmed that Fox News was confirmed.
The official did not tell the purpose, but there was at least one purpose.
According to the SA-125 press report, the Tartargat St.
Israel has failed to attack missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
457 foreign employees can go through the "Protective" test on Vyja.
The government is considering an "activism" test for foreign workers on 457 VIZ, because its purpose is to expand a harsh action.
If checked, this test will be applied through a set of values which is used to allow the family and friends to be transferred to Australia by means of a value intended to prevent 457.
A government discussion was issued today, condemning the government's words against foreign employees, former L.M. Maxine McQu today said it could distort neighboring countries of Australia.
He said to the United States India Institute that "national people are reaching the end of Qatar" and "Australians are being told a very rare double on a time when Greece has asked a safe market."
Historically, its intent was that white workers should have provided protection - and if some people in the area have seen the fulfillment of the historical witness.
The discussion article shows a pattern of 12 solutions, which was previously considered by former ex-municator Chris Bowin.
The minister Brandon O'Connor who was in Sri Lanka, where he meets authorities on the day he's been in Sri Lanka, has triggered five important changes, while the rest are skeptical.
If "visuality" is accepted, the search for the "administration" command can be made about whether Vija app is true in situations known as the owner, or the owner of the person known, Viza, who is the owner of the person who has approved the video.
The businesses may need to count the number of 247 votes, because first businessmen, who wanted to publish workers, took advantage of hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, 35-year-old Sri Lanka refugee, this week, passed through a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
The nine-year-old son of the man was with him on his journey to Australia, and on the Wednesday, after his father's death, he's a brother of his old cousin, who was in that pool.
The Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Massal and hospital where he died.
The British government has announced a study for the increase in the benefits of Scotland’s HS2 railway project.
HS2 represents high speed services in the north of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transportator Barnes Kramer said that "Brryen will be one of" from this project.
Kenneth Brown, from Scotland, said that working with the British government, working with the British government, is very "surpassed".
The first step involves a new high speed line between London and West Midlands.
When the second step is completed, lines will reach Manchester and Lids.
In June the government transferred the cost of high speed link between London and northern England to £32.7 billion billion.
The British government, which was discussing Scotland transport, directed HS2 to consider the possibility of the railway ability and the possibility of making the trip to Northern England and Scotland.
It includes the possibility of spending three hours or less of the possible travel time from Glossgo and Edinberg to London.
According to Barons Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring you and his cities near."
We're moving with HS2, because its benefits will be great.
Without it, we will face problems related to the ability of our railway network.
But this is also about the involvement of 18 cities of Glossgo and Edinburgh, which will be more closely connected with HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elisier Carmi, who said: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed Mr. Carmill to the H2 network of Scotland.
Mr. Brown said: "The chances of Scotland to have a huge financial profit from the high speed line, but this will also increase the financial burden on Scotland throughout Britain.
So we are excited to work in the British government's share so that we can examine options for the high speed line in Scotland, to create benefits for all and to fulfill the Global-Aidinberg line, which has already been planned by the Scottish government.
The following year I am willing to review the investigation report with the British government's ministers and make decisions on the next activity.
Aircraft tools rule will now be effective in Australia.
The move to be softer in the US will continue to shut down its telecasts and smart phones when they fly to Australia's airports and get off the plane.
U.S. Department has left the alternative to change their operations, so passengers will be able to read e-book, watch, play video, or play games on their devices during flight.
Travelers can do this just during a lot of flights, but it doesn't seem to be a failure to reach their e-book entries while flying and flying.
Australian air service companies are considering the decision, as the US Air Force Services companies have to do much work to meet this need, but they have no immediate plan to change their process.
The civil plane security officer also said that he is thinking about the announcement, but emphasized that there are restrictions on using electricity tools in Australia still in important stages.
"To CASA, there is no special order to control the power of power in the planes," said the official, "it comes to the conclusion that the plane service companies have to be fully established, and the security system has always been established by companies or companies."
Virginia, who is already communicating with CASA about the use of his in-FI-FI entertainment system, is already talking to the CASA, but he asked to follow this change, but he asked for further action.
"We will welcome review by CASA in the case of allowing the use of electricity tools, for we really feel that it will provide better experience for customers, because now we have (the current (visibility in flight) in our planes.
quantas said it's currently going to follow the current rules.
He said, "Our current policy cannot be used by electricity devices while flying and landing the plane, and we have no quick plan to change it."
The FA's decision applies to American Airlines.
Well, we're always interested in the genetic development that can benefit the passengers, and we'll definitely consider the FA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The effect of this decision will be different on every US Air Service firm and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
The Air Force Service companies will need to prove that they can endure radio transmissions from their plane mobile devices, as well as research their rules, training materials, car-on-Bajz programs and passengers to provide short descriptions.
FA said that he would allow the passengers to use the light-power tools such as the telenet, e-readers, and smartphones after their plane approval.
In less visible cases, drivers will direct off their equipment during the plane.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment under the seat or in the top boxes during flight and flight.
The silver of the panbrows because they feel difficult by the middle class in Singapore
In the Bedmire shopping Center in Ponshop, Singapore, Janina is taking a shower of gold to pay her daughter's school kiss, ring and hair to pay for her daughter's school fees.
"My husband and I have recently bought our house, so our money is involved."
They say, even though they earn 3,000 Singaporean dollars ($2,400 U.S.). and their husband also work, but family's monthly income is sufficient.
In fact, there is the same demand in South-east Asia - where home loans are increasing - Vulmux, this week, became the third poll listed on Singapore Stone.
It's not the only way to get down to the ground – 1,300 Singapore Dollars - but nearly as well as the safe bank as well.
usually Ponbrokers in Singapore pay 17 percent a year, less than 15.4 percent of which are offered by the United Operas Bank, which is a local taxpayback with the same shopping center.
However, the panbrows have the benefit of testing or the payment of the creditor, and they can be more easily available than the bank.
Millions of people in this region are seeking panshop because of the increasing cost of life by families and domestic and consumers due to increase in debt.
After five years of strong economic growth after global financial crisis, and after a simple economic policy of economics, families of the lower and medium I have been looking for their needs to meet.
This week's rating agency, Standers and Puppets, mainly reported the cost of the domestic profit due to the increase of the rising hostages (motgage) of the Asian Banks.
He said that in Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore in Asia, the highest housing rate in the number of domestic products.
With 80 percent of Malaysia's GDP, this list is located at the top of the list, while it was 60 percent in 2008.
In the economic Thailand country, consumers are concerned about the high level of debt, which is a light-striking from the technical level this week.
On Thursday, the data has always appeared low in the export and consumer demand.
In the Malaysian Bank, C.M., C.B., the academic Song wave said, "It's with the cost of increasing prices, [that] people from the lower classes will try to increase their income."
In the last two years, high values have motivated people to destroy personal resources because they are benefiting from the chances of losing their family's possessions.
70 percent of the items dropped in the 200-on restaurants in Singapore are gold.
People say, "The feeling of gold looks good, let's put grandmothers down the gold chain, and take back the next month."
Thailand’s largest Panshop director, EGMini, has seen 20 percent increase in the number of consumers using their own outlet in recent months.
There is so much increase in the work of keeping the church in Bedmir's office that 15 others are planning to expand in their neighborhoods, not just in their neighborhoods, where four shops are planning to expand, but also out of Asia, the work of the Walmas or Leginger.
Compani will use 60 percent of the $60 million waged on Singapore Stones in listing this week.
While some discontinus have been criticized for high interest rates, Sue Yaah says that other loans are not only a perfect rate compared to other debts, but it does not directly increase debt.
They say, "People put things before them that they already have, and do not increase the demand for personal policies.
The social acceptance of panbrokeing is increasing to receive short and secure financial assistance.
It's not that the panbrows use only the weakest person.
The rich people in Singapore also use the vanilla outlet, they lay the Gold Bar or Roleyx Clocks, which can pay 60 percent of their price.
We have all the clients of society.
Says Mr. Yaha, "I have a rich person who needs a price for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that need to satisfy their physical needs."
Sometimes they only need wealth in a very short time.
India's biggest businessman Mukesh Ambedi (Wifi Ninta Anami) is celebrating their 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita has been celebrating her birthday, not in Mumbai, but in the city.
He arranged a big party on this occasion.
Many large stars of Bollywood arrived at the entrance of the party. On October 31, many stars were seen holding the flight of Mount Mumbai Airport on Mumbai Airport.

325 million dollars saving package for taji's health
The UN has emphasized that the state government is also involved in the harsh conditions of the 325 million saving package for the health system, which will ensure that the state government cannot be destroyed.
The Federal Health Minister Tana Pubrz has announced that the United Nations has been doing “work” to solve the present crisis due to the growing population of the island, the rise rate of the disease, and the system's limitations.
During four years, the decision to receive education was followed after the government had been issued with independent Sanandro Wilkesi.
Mr. Plbrök said today, "There is an emergency defense package, which we believe will solve special challenges facing by the Kingdom.
The company of 325 million dollars includes the alternative service plan of 31 million.
There will be 2500 operations, including Athropak and Mothiantabande surgery, that will help to solve last united issues.
It also includes better care, training, medical experts, mental health care, and local health insurance systems to start a personal health archive system after Wok-in-in-law, a hospital.
Mrs. Ploveska said, "These investments are the best ways to improve the health system of Tesmania's health."
The minister insisted that Tasman's government will face severe reporting and accountability rule.
The Kingdom must maintain the current growth level to achieve the state wealth, and report every month where additional restrictions are being imposed.
Three members will be held to ensure that they are able to provide effective and effective services by the Kingdom.
Mr. Wilke said that the cost of 325 million dollars will not be much longer, "as long as Tesman's public health system does not improve more critical levels."
Yet, they praised the government for responding to their request immediately, which they first brought before the Prime Minister in May.
Mr. Wilkey said, "I hope the government will be very helpful in separating the public health system from the affected list."
According to the State government, these extra alternative processes will restore the most recent cuts.
But the Federal Health Prosecutor Peter Denton believes today's announcement "band-Aid's sense."
He said to the ABC TV, "We're here because the Lab State government has taken 430 million dollars in its health system.
The state government can't accept nearly half a billion dollars and 300 million dollars to be given by the world as a good news day.
Mr. Denton requested that Mr. Puperbrrec should give credit to the salvation package that none of the savings will be forced on extra additional jobs.
The better version of design and time period is design and times times, but it has been more than that.
The story of 1760's period of 1760, depicts the story of a young man named Sujaan, who sends Convenente to his family.
When she acts in rebellion, she suffers extreme cruelty at the hands of the Superper, and becomes an object of sexual attraction for another.
The film is never going to be committed to sexy or sanctimonious - and that's the problem.
This is also the risk of becoming a boring film because of the strongness of fiction.
Dr. Munna lion has decided to run into the garden in the streets of the CSA.
In the same way, 15 days have been collapsing the state of the section.
The chief observed the development of the foreign seeds and the regional search with the forest department on Friday morning.
Meanwhile, he found more workers, including the director of these departments, under their seat.
They warned them to cut down the wages the next time they were missing.
Dr. Nasash Khan, a university media official, said that he would have to make 30 cents for a month to travel.
On a $20 wage, people can go to the garden.
The system will be replaced by: files associated with different processes will be accessed under a system.
Each employee will not have the right to enter into his own file and the whole office.
Related authorities will bring their finals.
The watchman group said that Syria has destroyed the ability to make his chemical weapons
The guard who watched the Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important tools to make the chemical weapons and weapons of war, while in the northern part of Syria, a fierce conflict was found near the place where the poisonous agent was located.
And on Thursday, the Syrian Anandlon said that almost 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in Syria, about three years ago.
This announcement of the chemical weapons protecting organization has been one day before the final date of November 1
The Higgressive organization appointed Damascus to destroy the machine used to fill all chemical weapons units and to make them fit in the war materials.
The initial phase of destruction is the stone of the remarkable event that has been planned to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by the year of 2014.
To destroy the device means that Syria can no longer build a new chemical weapon.
However, Damascus is still to destroy the weapons and collections.
It is believed that Syria still has 1,000 milligrams and weapons, including Master Gas and Narve Agent Seren.
The British situation, Syrian Observatore for Human Rights, reported that this announcement took place when Guerrara grew up in the struggle in the city of Seifra, where experts believe it is a collection of chemical weapons and collections.
Adonian group with an article describing the number of dead people in Syria's network in Syria told Thursday that 120,96 people have died.

In 2002, the 202 persons who were killed in bomb blasts, and members of the 202 people who were killed in 2002, cried out to the bomb blaster, saying Samark should face fire band.

She can be released in 15 years when Peral is granted.
45-year-old Sumer, in the famous tourist area of Kuta, was attacked by two netizens who were killed, including 82 Australians, and many people were injured.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including the series bomb blasts in the Church of Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The activists asked for the execution of the Davina sacrifice, even though they could demand that this man who was known as a "disgusting person" as a bomber was called "the terrible man."
The decision resurfaced the painful memories of a woman living in India who had lost her 39-year-old bonds in the destructive attack by Chech and her associates a decade ago.
When he stopped his tears, he said he should have been killed.
I really feel that he should be punished like other terrorists.

The U.A.: Air Force Forces can now use gegates in the air (Can not call from the cell phone)
Air Force passengers will be able to use their electronic device - using their cellphones to continue their extended flights from entering the gate to work, play games, play games, play, watch music, listen to music.
But the passengers should not immediately expect these changes.
At a news conference, Michael Hartty, the director of the F.A., said how fast these changes are performed, it will be different in every Airlines.
Airlines will have to show how to complete the F.A.A.A. how their planes accomplish their new orientations, and how they're uploading the books of their own crews to provide training books and devices to store devices.
The F.A.A. said that he has already acquired plans from some Airlines to expand the use of Portable Electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Jatbub are among the Airlines that have already presented plans.
In a statement by F.A.A.A.A., "on the position of Jonah, we can readily accept the extensive use of electronic devices.
However, the passengers need to close their smartphones, tapes, and other devices when the plane is closed.
They are expected to reach 10,000 feet of planes and do not operate until Captain's permission is allowed.
The passengers are expected to reopen their devices when they get down to the plane, and don't run until the plane is completely off.
F.A.A.A. said that Airlines whose airlines are fully safe from the plane, they can allow their passengers to use the device while flying, while they are flying, and at the time of stressing.
Most new Airline companies and other airplanes are expected to meet these requirements.
The President of the Society of Pregnant, Laura Glading, has welcomed these changes.
One report said, "When the policy will run safely, and we will work together with Airlines companies to do so, this will be a victory for both sides."
When it comes to this point, we're starting to say "Hello Monitors".
The agency said that the Internet will still be banned using at least 10,000 feet to connect to at least 10,000 feet and store mail, send mail, send or receive messages, or download data.
The passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tapes, and other devices in Airpin mode.
So there can still be no communication with friends, such as online scroll game, which is connected to a popular event that was playing at the airport during the year 2011, while the American Airlines were playing on their smartphones while they were on the door.
And there's still to store the laptops like heavy equipment because they're concerned about the loss of another person in the cabin.
The cell phone call will continue to be banned during the flight.
The Virtual Rights Association, connected with the call, is near the U.S.
restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and flying during a plane may be off.
Last month Mark Rosekon of the National Transport Security Council, a national transport security expert, said that the cell phone is still a risk.
"Cel phones are really serious, but not only because they can probably cause a breakdown in the development-related device, but also because they can also cause the cell phone towers at the air."
To test this point by F.A., the executive committee of the world has gathered last month to allow the government to allow more use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure has increased to reduce the use of the FAA to lower the risk of using them.
Clarar McCack, D-M, has said that there's no valid security reasons for the execution.
These restrictions are also more difficult because the use of the device is incompetent.
Some studies also indicate that nearly three third passengers forget or ignore direction from their device.
The use of electronic devices by the F.A.A. has been banned in 1996 since the use of electronic devices by the Yares, when the Yares received a report in navigation and communication devices due to taking F.M. radios and radios of the time.
New Airlines companies are more dependent on the previous generation than on the last generation of planes, but they are also designed to oppose the F.A. to oppose electronic intervention.
Airlines have been using y-fai for many years since the use of the y-Fai on the crossline height.
The planes that have been modified for Y-Fai system are also more resistance to pollution.
Horta said that most Airlines companies should be true to the qualifications for more use of the new directional electronic device.
Today's electronic device releases a lot of power transmissions compared to the previous generation's electronic device.
For example, e-reeds, converting the exact equivalent during the page conversion.
But the transfer rate is powerful when the device downloads or sends data.
Among those who use the device using the device are Amazon.com.com.
In 2011, the company's authorities loaded their entire Kingdom E-readers in Airlines and made it a test of problems but no such problem was found.
The F.A.A.M. has expressed mixed emotions about the risk of using the device.
Dugas Ked of the National Air Force Traveler said that they believe that the device is a real problem, whether it is a risk.
Other members of the committee said that only pilots are described as being described by pilots in support of the device’s transfer system, most of which are very old.
However, members of the committee agreed to allow the FAAAP pilot to order users to shut down the device while they were removing the device.
The travel industry group has welcomed changes and has also made them use of general knowledge of people who travel to the latest part of technology.
The U.S. Tralog Association's C.O.R.R. has said that we are happy that the F.A.A. has recognized that the passengers traveling with joy are not equal to safety, security and security.

Is Europe’s highest class ready to trade with Britain?
In April, Business for Britain was introduced to Britain and promised to bring the business together and to determine what changes to our relationship with the UK's labor and prosperitymaker EU.
For him, we held the largest and most widely held issues of Britain's commercial leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain's business with EU.
U-Gov has considered 1,000 business leaders, representing the business size, fields and places of Britain.
The conclusion of this survey may be amazing for many.
We found that a large part of business wants to export out of Europe now, and to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU members are slow.
They want the government to focus on new business relationships with such countries as China, India, and Brazil, not that EU’s secret societies have long and hard to process.
When asked about certain policy fields such as the right to the standard law, the majority of business leaders believed that the control of these electoral qualifications should be back to Westmester.
It was easy to be seen with a single market, while businessmen say that the price of Brazil’s Maninism is far more than that of the benefits of Europe’s commercial sectors - even large business, which was in the sight of 40 percent of the European companies in general.
In the end and most clearly, our audience of commercial leaders found that a large portion clearly wanted to go ahead with Britain, EU rather than politics.
The conclusion was seen in the levels of major business groups, showing that businessmen are moving to a "real change", which would provide the lack of power to UKK.
The value of its high price – the point of a transition to Britain and a better deal, changed 16 percent in the case of staying in EU.
The Prime Minister should not have any doubt: it is reasonable that Britain's business, the EU, supports their plans to talk about the terms of Britain's subscriptions.
It also showed that businessmen expect to rehabilitate a significant change in the sides of the U.C.
A better deal for British business is possible, and very fast it is going to be necessary, since the Eurojoan, related economic and state organization is moving forward.
The priority must be to have jobs and increase in Britain, as our survey points indicate that it means businessmen to make basic changes in a new contraception system and in the mid-winning process of a new constituency system.

Scientists have also published more light on the matter of how the dog's tail has a connection between its mouth and its brain.
The previous findings indicate that happy dogs move their backs to the right, while the Bebean dogs move their tail at the top of the left.
But now scientists say that partners can recognize this tiny secret of dogs and respond to it.
This study is published in the Journal Cort Biloge.
Professor George Wellgra from the University of Toronto said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in a different process that produces positive or negative feelings."
Here we try to see it also among the nations.
He told them that the right part of the brain, like men, was responsible for dissident and opposite order, and two shots played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to moving by other dogs, researchers watch other dogs.
He measured the hearts of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably don't have much time to understand why their twos sometimes move on opposite sides.
Prolatora said: "We have offered dogs with dogs to deal with dogs - in the photos, and in the pictures, and we could look at the front left or the left. "
And it came to pass, when the beasts saw a wild beast moving toward the south, that they might rest safely.
But when they turned their backs on the back, their hearts were hardened, and they looked as if they were turning their backs on the left.
According to the Pre-Ellipger, they don't think dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these abuses.
Instead, they think dogs have learned from their experience how to worry about what they should be concerned and not on whom.
He said: "If you've met the other dogs many times, and if they move their tail regularly, this is related to friendship behavior, and it's a little bit of friendship, and you're reacting on the same experience."
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about the feelings of animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert at the University of Bristol, explained that it is not the first study to check whether the left or the right part is important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Lincoln found that when the dogs see a dog, they move their head to the left and their head to see the happy dog.
In another research of the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "On the contrary, when the robot's head was moved to the left, it was more likely to reach the dogs instead of reaching the dogs."
He said that it was because dogs in different studies didn't fully understand animals or robots dogs.
He explained that it can help a study of how to react to real dogs through dogs.
"While various breasts have been given a lot of evidence that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still being found - and there are no dogs in this case," he said.
However, the easy way their behavior can be applied, it seems that we probably don’t take much time to realize why their differences sometimes move one side of another.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February.
The Vatican has announced that Pope Francis would first become a new cardinal of the Catholic Church on February 22th.
The cardinals, the Catholic Church, are priests of the highest degree, their positions are only below the pope, and they choose the pope, so Francis will assume the first group of his men, which will eventually help choose their successor.
There's 201 Cardsells right there.
Well, after arriving at 80 years of age, cardinals are not allowed to participate in the pope's election - it comes in a group of 120 "Padical Elections" group.
In a moment of announcing the news, Fedrico Lambadard, president of the Vatican, said that before the convention of new cardinals, all present cards will be held, which call Pope-linda.
Lombard said, "Possis has decided to make his decision to hold the pope of February to make it easier to make it easier for other parties from different countries."
Jack Valer of the Catholic Voice said that by February, the number of cardinals had dropped by February.
He generally declared that Pope, the number of cardinals is less than 120, as many as 120 cards, and that according to their wish, more than 80 years of age.
Valler said that the pope will be important in the next year, because it will be the first Pope after the arrival of France in March.
Currently, there is a type of prejudice toward Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see what new popes, even from the rest of the world do.
In South America, 40 percent of Roman Catholics are Roman Catholics, but their number is very few.
Francis's Council - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose work is to seek reform the church, will also be the first to be selected after the election.
The pope first made his own decision.
Vallero said, "But now France has chosen these eight cardinals to help."
He said that it's "equino" that French must ask for advice.
But we're not first in this situation - it's totally new.
Valerro said that Pope bishops usually take sides in large places, but France was "the most surprised, so we don't know who they call."

Obadi’s Disappointments of Obama’s Controversy
I gave Obama twice before I could change
They say Obama's great efforts have been banned because of the G.O.P.'s policy.
Opposition policy cannot allow the suffering of Obama’s website, drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 conference reminds us of what could happen
The National P. Morrisherd Medical School is second-year-old students.
I've been reading very painful books today.
It's a book about which I think it will stir me up during the Second Year of Medical School and give me hope.
Its name is "the courage of survival", and it's the title of the 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get tired from my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me into a period of time in which politics inspired millions of people to stop your breath.
The elections proved to be one, and the news speakers took advantage of the historical significance of that time.
My classmates' eyes were tears of joy, and my parents saved the news every meeting.
A group of distant persons were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, they had 82 percent approval ratings during Obama's president.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to remember a distant, a painful memory of past events.
It's actually changed since I first went to the poll.
Simply, I couldn't imagine any of it.
I'll give Obama credit for a lot of options, from the FBI to our army in Iraq, with the end of "Don't ask me" until Osama Bin Laden dies.
I also believe that the policy of opposition to the country has prevented many efforts to move ahead of our country: which includes the public choice for foreign reform, health services, and the blockades of the Ghottimo Bay, and other other.
But countless times in which I take the side of my colleagues and my colleagues to be equal to Obama administration, I end up with what I can give them.
I've reached the point of political disappointment.
The opposition to the Republic is not the answer to foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on female children in foreign countries.
It cannot answer the national security agency to store data on the private life of ordinary American citizens or answer to the government’s mismanagement of the government’s mismanagement.
It cannot tell the reason for the murder of American American citizen Anwar El Alaki, without any travel, is not the cause of the murder of the murder of the U.S. President Campan.
It can't answer the results of that report, which says that by the White House, the effort to silence Medio is "the most urgent thing ever since the unexplained administration."
And the most recently, it can't offer a simple website to design the failure of a simple website after three years of being signed in the Press Care Act.
I don't know what I expected.
If, in the age of 18, I should have guessed that the regime system could break the political campaign which will bring it forward.
Apparently, the electoral office is not a precedent, since opposition political parties and memorable events such as the Newtown murders, our public discussion.
Yet the examples I have set above are most likely to be chosen by the administration.
This thing bothers you most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited with his expectations.
Ms. Romani presented a singled and unsatisfied option that didn't seem as if their policies or their position were not as valid.
I thought Obama would meet another job that would be free of the choice of future choices, the expectations we have been listening to for a long time.
However, while Obama's consenting rating is less than 45 percent of this week, returning to 2008 has become very difficult in 2008.
Seeing her, I miss their last promises.
This week was reading a portion of the book, which was described as how Obama had a huge loss because of Obama's override in Pennsylvania.
In a post-Martam Camping, he told his officials that they need to return to the park, and need to be honest on their purposes.
He said, "I want to get back to my uncle."
We should remember who we are.'
Five years later, President President I can't agree with you any more.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are from the Nethanal Morris.

So because if anyone does not like it, he can remove it.
It seems impossible to use pencils today.
The election costs are studying options for electronic media, and recently a joint with New Zealand has been released.

The god of wealth is given to the god of substance, and to the god of death, Jemiz king.
Our religion and life are the most important place.
No wealth is good.
It's good to feel our feelings for money.
There is nothing more valuable than a man's work, but the wealth that makes for pride has no meaning.
For we have riches, that we may obtain from holy things; and from holy to holy.
Every person has a responsibility to earn money for the family.
Some parts of it should also have a sense of euphoria on society, but the motivation to undue collection or Yon-Ken-Eun-e-de-definable gains is to destroy our conscience, personality.
The spirit of charity should remain in my mind forever.
Any part of the wealth you provided may be the basis for a life of singleness.

In fact, men of life have been given the meaning, religion, work, and moksha.
Every man works riches and success, and every man gains wealth and success.
It's the richest thing to have the honor connected.
How much more shall a man be rich, and he shall not be satisfied in his own way, neither shall he be able to do another's work?
Don't boast in anyone else's wealth.
He that is rich is the man that is to go into great riches through the multitude of riches.
There is nothing more valuable than the creation of the work for others.
Another thing, not just money as money.
It would also be your health, character, love for others.
Try to make you master this wealth.

The police have completely removed the security of the former Prime Minister Hahan Khan, including the People's Democratic Party, who is involved in the Congress.
Khan appointed the government responsible for it and said that their security has been removed for political reasons.
Let's be surprised that a year after the performance of the PDP ticket year in 2002, slaves who won the election were included in their prime minister's domain.
Slave Hasan Khan said I've had the security chain since 1996.
I dwell in the towers of terrors, called terrorists.
One of the CRPF's security charges at my house was in the lead of all inspectors.
There are guards with me, but my fighter was suddenly taken back.
I spoke to Jill Sp while security phoned my house.
But rather than restore security, he just said he'd check this case.
In this context, however, when he was contacted by Kashmir's Ignail Ghosh Mir, he refused to report the matter and said that it was sensitive.
I will examine how a former minister and vice leader have finally removed the security of the leader of the Shisi.
The country's head of Congress said to Safundan Souz that there is no such thing as my information.
It's very serious if Hasan Khan's defense has been compromised.
I'm in Jammu right now in the next two days.
I'll discuss this point with the relevant administration.
According to the report, the U.S. government spent $85 million in the last four years to celebrate the victory of the leaders.
Rather, there was a period between the NDA (between 1999 and 2004) during the rule of Odin Bajputi Bajpei (from 1999 to 2004) a period that had not been issued by the government for two years (201-02).
Mudi said that before he had no advertising on the chances of the winner of the winner's victory, he was based on a 182-year-old "Stal of University" in Gujarat's village, which was 182 feet [182 m] high in the state of Gujarat.
While the DVP reports that the UVP has spent 4.10 million in 2009, 2010-10 million in 2010 and 2.7 million in 2011 and in 2012.4 million in 2012.
When Central Information and Media Minister Mani was asked about Modi's properties, he said that the PM Candate does not talk about the facts.
In 2008 no advertising was obtained at Phelal.
The third said that this was due to economic collapse that year.
However, the money spent on the advertising of the presidential panel is less than enough to cost the winners and family members of Nehauru-Gandandand families each year.
DVP spent 33 million to win Mahatma Gandhi's victory and promise, 21 million to the east PM Rajdha Gandhi, 145 million to India's Gandalgaon, and 938 million to red negotiators.
When asked about this space, he said, "It should not be seen from the perspective of the commercials on advertising."
Because the price of advertising depends on a number of things, including the use of advertising or advertising products for that year.
The fact is that it shows our dedication to which people who oppose are trying to handle the inheritance of a great leader without knowing it.
Today, he will meet the families of the people who were killed in the railway station last Sunday.
Within a week of the explosion, the police have been shut down in security by seeing the republished reopening of Narndra Modi's trip.
The police tested the exact route of Modi's journey and meeting places.
Police will be watching people who come to the meetings.
The Gujarati police force, the NSIB and the state police will watch security.
Modi's security will be covered and broken.
Meanwhile, there are also questions on the Ajju's AjP's Assessment journey.
The minister of the State is accused of destroying the BJP environment.
Moving From clay, rivers, and woods to provide medical services
Dr. Georges Well, who has served in rural areas of Cameroon
The branch and its crew watch hundreds of sick people every week
The West African countries do not have much medicine; only for 5,000 people
Give your vote here or give it through mobile.
Dr. Georges Well, in 2013, is one of the 10 chiefs of C.N.A.
You can vote for them or for someone in another top 10 to make C.N.A.'s chief of the year.
The winner will get $50,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to Hosea and gone to the hospital, which was not well equipped to help them.
Jameel Well, in 1981, was involved in an accident near the border of Cameroon, the capital of Cameroon.
Their hands were broken in the beginning, but a infection spread to their brain, and he created bloodbath, which affected their remaining lives.
Georges Well says, "There was no cancer in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well continued to work with his father with a huge crowd of Clemens and hospitals and to receive any treatment.
She said, "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5:00 a.m. hoping you'll be the first person to get to the hospital, but it's not.
There are many sick people there.
Some people can be waiting in the mouth of death.
The situation has not changed much since Well's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, there is a physician for every 413 people in the United States.
And if there be any physician there, many of Cameroon's inhabitants can't afford it.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country, and about two thirds of the income in the country is a personal area.
Well says, "He's the only problem they have is poor."
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their life.
When he saw the affliction of his father and his people, and the pain of their land, he determined to bring it to him.
Dr. Georges and their team of volunteers have been in the field of medical treatment for the past 700 years.
They also became a medical doctor, and worked as a vishal surgeon at the Center of Young.
And they started the non-lasal organization, which goes on to rural areas on week after week to provide medical services.
Since 2008, they and their volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
On nearly every Friday they and about 30 people sit in the lake, bound from roof to roof, and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes not with them.
They need more than one time to push the vehicles out of rivers and clay.
But when they arrive, they receive the real honor: the best of guests, singing and dancing, and the community.
These villages are truly a source of medical service, and well - with their big smiles and endless energy.
The next morning, his team starts to meet hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We're meeting 500 people every trip."
They come from the village about 60 km from the village, and they come to Paddles.
These are all weeks of clinics providing various medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, diabetes, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people can get a market, credit card, or non-profit birth certificate -- this document is needed in schools but many poor families can't afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local expression.
Operations are usually held at the school house, at the Tower Hall or at the house; after the process, the patient goes to the bed and builds a place for the next person.
The group publishes the generators in the room and satellite devices, and their own volunteers get up early on Sunday morning.
It's a slow pace, but village musicians usually help the team to be motivated.
Well said, "They keep playing the drums all night to keep us alive and continue our work."
On Sunday their troops return to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group, including Cameroon’s medical and foreign medical students, has been a medical doctor for the past 700 years, and they know that help can change the world of those who help them.
One person said that Nielsk would be able to go back to work because he had a medical condition.
And the man said: This will change my and my family's future.
Apart from working as a medical-squatic in the weekly clinic and working as a medical test at the hospital, El works in the private medical clinic near Yon during the night.
He told them that this is another job that contributes to 60% of their non-work work; the rest of the share is completed by personal donations.
"I don't know when they sleep"
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to make a profit for their organization so they can keep them running.
This is a practical opportunity for students from United States and Europe who come from the United States and Europe to join the efforts of O'Malley, who can never get into their country.
O'Malley said, "In the genetic medical treatment we hold a tool for Dr. Well, we are able to get practical experience."
You will never have the opportunity to do this as a second-year-old medical student in the United States.
Volunteer students usually feed themselves from their own to visit Cameroon, and they often come with the medical intercedes of charity.
But they live in Anna-Ja, and pay the instructions.
O'Mali says, "There's no doubt they're sharks."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroonns will never end.
For the vine, almost the weight of a job, not hard.
Help others to live a happy life, fulfill your father’s promise, these are the things that make them very happy.
Well says, "I am very happy when I do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.
