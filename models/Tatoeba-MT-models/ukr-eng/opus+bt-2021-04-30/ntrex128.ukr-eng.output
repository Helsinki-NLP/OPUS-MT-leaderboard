The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they will be "associate with mappetts"
Some of the currents are horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their position to the "member of the parliament of Wales" (MWP).
This recommendation appeared due to plans to change the Assembly's name to the Wales Parliament.
The current of the entire political spectrum is concerned that this may provoke ridicule.
One line from the Labourists said his group was troubled by rum with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "induscient", and "pwp" means act of defecation.
The line from the Wales Party said its group as a whole is "not satisfied" and offers alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said that his group was "in open-minded" about changing the name, but drew attention that the MWP could quickly become a "mappet".
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to that of the Yoruba English pronunciation of "u".
The Assembly Commission, which currently developing legislation to change the names, noted: "The final decision on the new name of the members of the assembly will certainly be made by the members themselves."
The 2017 Wales Self-government Act gives the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales received widespread support.
Regarding what to call ah, the commission proposes to call them "the members of the Parliament of Wales", i.e. WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest public support.
Of course, the line offers alternatives, but attempts to reach agreement may cause problems to Chairman Elin Jones, who should submit a reform bill for several weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the assembly, among which rules of separation of the line and structure of the committee system.
the line will hold a final vote regarding its new name as they discuss legislation.
The Macedonians go to vote for a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters vote on whether to change the country's name to the Northern Macedonia Republic.
The vote was organized to resolve a centuries-old dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a claim to Greece territory, and has repeatedly opposed the membership of Macedonia in the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia George Ivanov, who opposes conducting a referendum on the change of the name, stated that he would ignore the vote results.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is just the price to be paid for entering the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin are silent because Harlem's churches are experiencing difficult times
"The old people I've been talking to say that there was a bar and a church here at every corner," says Mr. Adams. — —
Now there's neither."
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
"In modern times, people are socializing differently.
The bars are no longer a local living room where they regularly enter."
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough for as long as the leaders expect, and "early or later they end up where they started."
The churches, he added, can replace homes with condominiums, and there will be people living who will not help the shrines left nearby.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condomines in these houses will be white," Adams explained, "so it will speed up the day when all these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their patrons."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: The Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870 and Saint Martin was built ten years later.
Corinna the white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The Black Community, which conducted rituals nearby, was granted ownership of the building.
Saint Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main trading street, and these merchants did not want to accept black people's jobs and raise them in service.
In 1939 the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners wanted to recover it and installed a carrion.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in Saint-Marten, proudly referred to the carrion as "the scoundrels of the poor."
The expert who played the carrion in July called it differently: "cultural treasure" and "inchanged historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world's first carrillion to play the black musician Dionicio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger Caribbean in Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merriveser, no replacement was found in St. Martin's.
What's happening in Saint-Marten over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of which have been involved with church leaders, some being the Episcopal diocese.
The Council is a governing parish body consisting of laymen leaders, in July writing to the diocese concerned that the diocese would "will seek to transfer the costs" by the council not participating in the hire of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Akula injured a 13-year-old boy who dived behind lobbyers in California
According to the official, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and the boy dived behind the lobbyers in California on the day of the opening of the lobbyers season.
The attack took place at almost 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV canal in San Diego that in the morning on Saturday he had been diving with friends when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and along with the group came to him to pull out of the water.
Hammel initially thought it was just a thrill about the caught lobbyer, but then he realized the boy was screaming, "I got bit!
I've been bit!"
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
"I shouted to all to get out of the water, 'In the shark'!" added Hammel.
The boy was taken to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that has committed the attack is unknown.
A rescue captain, Larry Jayles, told the media that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in this area, but it was established that it did not refer to dangerous species of sharks.
Jayles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
For the purposes of investigation and security, authorities shut down access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas.
Jayles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are to go to the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdreug, and Debenhams using islands with cosmetics similar to those in the departmentrs. Work on the islands will be skilled sellers.
As part of the increased output to the British Space Market, $2.8 billion (continues to grow as the sale of clothes and goods for the house drops) the increased islands with cosmetics will be protested in 11 stores across the country, and in the following year, if the idea turns out to be successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics relate to supermarkets seeking ways to use the general space that had previously been used under television, microwave furnaces, and goods for the home.
In Sainsbury's said that they would double the makeup of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 goods, including first brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: brand zones will appear similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket also updates Boutique cosmetics assortment: most of the goods presented will now not be tested on animals, which are increasingly required by young buyers.
In addition, the retailer of the Parameria Fragrance Shop protests his stalls at two Sonsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, northern London, last week, and the second opens at Selli-Ouk, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and moving to purchase small amounts of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coope, executive director of the Sainsbury's, said their stores would become more like department stores as the supermarket network tries to confront Aldi and Lidl discers using more services and unsold goods.
Sainsbury's open Argos departments in hundreds of their stores, also open a number of Hubitats departments. Sainsbury's purchased both networks two years ago and argue that this increased the sales of food goods, and also made both networks more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to update the cosmetics and pharmaceutical goods departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested the collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute about how to separate revenues from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its apothetic business (281 pharmacies) Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an extended range of the hatching brands to skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury, stated: "We have changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant for buyers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who would be able to give advice.
Presented to us by the brands' aorty is called to meet any needs, and a pleasant atmosphere and a comfortable location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which constitutes competition of the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "surprised" because Holly Willoughby left the deal worth $11 million
The Dragon League star Peter Jones "surprised" because TV host Holly Willowby has come out of an agreement with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is $11 million) to focus on new Marks & Spencer and ITV contracts
Willob doesn't have time for a brand of home clothes and axesseurs Truly.
The business of the pair was associated with the Goop Gwyne Peltro brand.
A 37-year-old program host This Morning announced its entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willowby proved the Dragon League star to be Peter Jones until the last moment came out of their lucrative business of goods for life to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones's "surprised" when a gold girl from the TV confessed during an intense meeting on Tuesday at Jones's headquarters in Marlow, Binghamshire, that her new deals costing £1.5 million means she no longer has enough time to dedicate it to their joint brand of domestic clothing and the axesseurs of Truly.
This business was associated with the Goop Gvinet Peltro brand and had to double the Villaubi fortunes, which is estimated at $11 million.
When 37-year-old Willouby reported to Instagram going from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his homes for recreation.
The source reported: "Truly was no doubt Holly's main priority.
He was to become her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoby's decision to get out of the business shocked all the interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
In the headquarters in Marlou is a complete warehouse of things ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the entrance of the leading This Morning, which is one of Britain's most highly paid stars, could cost firm millions due to large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and domestic clothing) and create further delays with launch.
This can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three of Willouby's children and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willobie and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of rule in March.
Couples held festivals together, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's shares, which deals with telemarketing.
Willob will become an ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Anthony McPartlelin as host I'm A Celebrity to ITV.
Source, near Jones, said last night, "We will not comment on his affairs."
A hard conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he would get from news media for a comment that someone would consider "not presidential" and for a very positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
"Why did President Trump make such big concessions?,
said Trump, imitating the voice of the lead news. — —
I didn't go to any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump named their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step toward the denoclelarization of North Korea.
But negotiations about denocleralization went to a dead end.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat Ring Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "revocal response" from the United States on its first steps on disarming.
Instead, he remarked, the United States continues sanctions aimed at supporting the pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions would be killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results: the end of rocket trials, the release of hostages, and the return of the remnants of American military personnel home.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke of his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this batting stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of those killed
In particular, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-government organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboka's population was affected, national disaster was not announced, and this is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they don't seek international help, so it's a little hard," said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children, the team gathers for a trip to Palu, as far as it is known to be possible for foreign personnel to work in place.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster elimination agency, stated that Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Considering the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly untrained for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh Province, shelters are built from tsunamis, but they are not typical of other coasts.
The apparent lack of siren's warning of tsunamis in Palu, though the warning was active, likely contributed to death.
It is not just in the best of times to move among the many Indonesian islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lomboca to treat earthquake victims floats to Palu, but it can reach the location of the new disaster at least three days later.
President Joko Uidodo made improvements in Indonesia's infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased costs on roads and railways.
But funding deficits created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, which plans to re-elect in the following year.
Panu Joko also interferes with the ongoing interfaith feud in those parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people died, tens of thousands were evicted from their homes as a result of opposition to Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using matchete, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

The House of Cromwell at Parliament becomes a new monument that will be affected by the "resusion of history"
The removal of the statue would be deserved to be crucified for destroying in the Taliban style of many cultural and religious artifacts in England, which was carried out by his fanatical Catholic followers.
But Cromwell's Community called Mr. Krick's offer "stupidity" and "a desire to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said, "Looking at the current debate on the removal of statues, that Oliver Cromwell's statue near Westminster Palace would be a target, was inevitable."
The iconoclasty during the English Civil Wars was not performed by Cromwell himself nor on his orders.
It is likely that Cromwell will be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell, sculptor William Hamo Thornecroft, is a testimony to the sentiments of the 19th century and part of the history of the figure which many think is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, probably more in the late 19th century than now, consider Cromwell to defend Parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, monarchies.
Whether such an idea is entirely accurate is the subject of the ongoing historical debate.
There is no doubt only that the conflict of the mid-19th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell was one of the famous figures representing one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord-Protestor should also be celebrated and honored."
The killer pig destroyed the Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in the market in southwestern China.
A man identified only by Yuang's surname was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a lead in the market in Liupanshu Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Cinhai, Cinhai Province, China, on 30 May 2005, the pig is going to pump pigs into pork.
He is reported to have left on Wednesday with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw the lead door open.
The brother noted that the piggy had a large boar with blood on its mouth.
The court-medic expert confirmed that the 249-pound cane had destroyed the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were in blood and disfigured," said the victim's cousin with the surname Wu, which was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera record showed that Yuan had come to market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
An animal that killed a man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence on the scene, the pig was locked to prevent her from attacking people.
Seven I'm Yuan and the market administration are reported to be discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, the cases of swine attacks were still recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and injured a man of critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig held the Welsh farmer pressed on to the tractor until the farmer's wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer said CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can become "treger".
"They're just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring extensive rainfall to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was projected to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the near days, Rosa will bring rains to northern Mexico and southwestern the United States.
Rosa had winds of 137 km per hour (this is a hurricane of category 1) on 5 morning east time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta-Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that on Sunday, Rosa will go north.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean begins to form a logger that moves east to the west coast of the United States as it approaches the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, it begins to push strong tropical humidity north to the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the nearest days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching log, will create strong rainfall in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 cm of rain will cause hazardous flooding, garbage streams, and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will result in increased rainfall in places up to 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm rain is expected in some parts of the south west, especially in a significant area of Arizona.
The torrential floods are possible in rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We are encouraged not to walk into the desert on foot, for tropical rain is possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will bring rushing winds and dust storms.
The approach of the valley will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause heavy streams of garbage and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and morning on Monday and Monday evening on Monday and Tuesday rain will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will go over the Forr Courters from Tuesday on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperatures across the United States can be observed as Arctic becomes colder, but tropicals remain quite warm.
In some cases, this results in a sharp drop in temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, a fine example of a sharp temperature swing in the central United States will be observed.
It's almost 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the summer will warmly try to return and spread again.
The temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast is expected to be 27 degrees Celsius in significant areas of the center and east of the United States.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is approximately 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have been observed listening in Bretta Cavano case
On Thursday, over 20 million people on six television networks watched the exciting testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court Justice Bretta Cavano and Christine Blazi Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, channels interrupted scheduled programs to report the final news of Friday: an agreement prepared by Senator Arizona by Jeff Flake, on the conduct of the FBI of a one-week investigation on the charge.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavano was touching her drunk and was trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Cavano said in his emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure he wasn't.
It is quite likely that more than 20.4 million people were watching this on Friday, as Nielsen's research company reported.
The company calculated a secondary audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Unable to get the numbers immediately on other networks which also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
In comparison, such an audience is about the size of an audience watching a play-off series or the Oscar Award.
Fox News Channel, whose thought shows strongly supported Kavano's appointment, was the leader among all channels during a hearing that lasted the entire day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, noted in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.5 million.
Interests remained high after hearing.
Flake became the central figure of the Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavano, then on Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras were recorded as protesters shouted at Flake when he tried to go on an elevator to the hearing of the Court Committee.
He stood with swollen eyes for a few minutes, during which he was cursed, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“ I’m standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth of the country?
He was told, "You have power, and countless women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had published a statement and, before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more on the committee's hearing.
All cable and wide-language channels were broadcast for hours later, when the Court Committee was to vote on the promotion of Cawano's candidacy to vote to the Senate in full stock.
Flake said he would do it only if he knew that the FBI would consider the charge against the next week's candidate, which a democratic minority demands.
Flake has partly convinced conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with Kuns, and then with several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had an impact, because it was obvious that Republicans would have no vote to appoint Cavano's candidacy without investigation.
President Trump initiated FBI investigations against Cavano.

The volcano dumps ash on Mexico City
The raft, which is ejected by the Popocatepetl volcano, reached southern areas of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Disaster Warning Center on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater was active and 183 gas emissions and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center followed numerous noises and swings.
A photo on social media shows thin layers of ash on the car's lobby glass in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Chemiliko.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 ball in central Mexico in September 2017.

The independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to follow a different route.
68-year-old Narsis Teremes, an electricity involved in the separatist protest with his wife, stated that he no longer had the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they can vote, but now we're in a dead corner," he said.
Despite the vital but very complex victory in regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties fighting for independence failed to preserve the momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment in anticipation of the court for their participation in the referendum organization and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed protests in support of police on the phone, stated that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"The tension grows", he said.
On Saturday, Oryol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalonian leaders who are in the investigator's office from the end of last year, announced that the following year he would run for the European Parliament.
"The candidate's status in European elections is the best way to condemn regression of democratic values and repression that we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men were arrested after the car drove into the house
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car hit a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard-Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 per British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings noted that the gate was damaged and the house itself.
At some point, it is possible that at some point the car was fired from the arena.
Menga's strike provided a Lewingston victory over Rangers with a 1-0 score
Dolly Menga's first goal in Liwingstone became victorious
The high-ranked Lavingston class shocked Rangers and brought Stephen Gerard a second defeat from 18 games as the manager of the Aybrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved decisive: Gary Holt's team rose one level in a second from Hibernian.
Gerard's team won no win in the Premier League of this season and the following Sunday plays with the Harts leaders, from which she is behind for eight points.
Before this, on Thursday, Rangers will accept Rapida Vienna as part of the European League.
Meanwhile, the Riverston continues its invincible move to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has not yet been defeated after replacing Kenny Milner last month.
"Lewingston" assumes the odds that are granted to the unremitting guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead long before they scored, because their directness creates Rangers of all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through defense, but made a strike along the gate, then Alan Litgo kicked past the gate after opposing and accepting Craig Halkett's strike along the gate which the one made head.
The hosts were satisfied that they allowed Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew they could cause trouble to guests from standard positions.
And the crucial goal was killed.
Rangers missed a free strike, and the Riverston made a opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Meng, who took the ball and scored from the penalty centre.
Prior to this stage, Rangers dominated the ownership of the ball, but the defense of the hosts of the fields proved to be irreproachable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely not disturbing.
This trend continued in the second taim, although Alfredo Morelos managed to make a strike towards Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot off the legs of the Rangers Allan McGregor. Litgo hit the gate in another standard Lavingstone combination.
The signs were constantly flown into the Lavingston fine and continuously neutralized, and the two applications on the penalty — after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton, who had been replaced, and at the game by the hand — were rejected.
"Leingstone Fenoman: Analysis
Alladair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaron Arena
The Fenomenal Game and the result of "Lewingstone".
Everyone to one played well, they continued to exceed the expectations of this updraft trajectory.
Their style of play and composition did not change much after returning to the highest level, but it should be given to Holt for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grandly, very well organized the defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep alert.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerard's leadership, but now they don't get much to those standards.
They didn't have the last ball — only once they broke the defense of the land's masters — and it was sort of waking up for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdogana was consistently hosted in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29,) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a smile and blue sky.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There have been some controversy over issues such as human rights, freedom of press, and the introduction of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police did not give 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the president's supporters did appear nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — among them many Kurds — have also forced themselves to hear; they condemn Erdogan's politics and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Two - sided protests testify to the ambiguity of a guest, whom some German Turks called a hero and others to be a dictator.
An expensive accident in Depford: A cyclist was killed in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car collision in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Beloud Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Deptford area in the southeast of the city at around 10:15 a.m. at the British standard time.
The car driver stopped, and paramedics came to the scene, but the man was killed on the spot.
This accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after escaping the driver from the accident site at Childrs Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday accident.
The London police said they were working on the establishment of a man's identity to inform his immediate relatives.
Travels are also banned, and bus routes have been changed, and motor vehicles are recommended to avoid this zone.
Long-Laartin Prison: Six prison guards injured in riots
Six prison workers were injured as a result of a riot in the men's prison of strict regime, reported to the prison administration.
The imprisonment in Her Majesty Long-Laartin's prison in Wustershire began at approximately 09:30 at the British standard time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
To stop the riots initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special section of Tornado was called up.
The officers were given medical care due to light facial injuries received on the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: "For the solution of the incident continuing in Her Majesty Long-Laartin prison, special-trained prison staff were involved.
Six employees received medical care due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make clear that responsible ones will be sent to the police and their prison term may be extended."
In her Majesty's Prison, Long-Laartin has more than 500 prisoners, among whom the country's most dangerous offenders.
June reported that the prison chief was sent to permanent treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a special police unit was summoned to prison to stop serious riots, in which prison inmates were attacked with billboard layers
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with torrential floods (annexing territory this may be in favour)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but that's what might happen at the beginning of the next week, because the remnants of the hurricane Rose are heading through the southwest of the desert, creating a risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already published a warning of torrential floods on Monday and Tuesday in the territory from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday is expected to rain in the evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones retained the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
and Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricanes Center, the Moullon-Rome area in Arizona is expected to range from 5.08 to 10.16 cm and the locations to 15.24 cm of rainfall.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Bassain, will probably get from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of rainfall, places maybe up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rains are likely to be useful because the south-west is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Center for the monitoring of drought, a little over 40 percent of Arizona's territory is suffering at least extreme drought, which is the second highest rate of drought, reports weather.com.
First of all, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landslides on the Mexican Lower California Peninsula.
Rosa, on Sunday morning still in the power of the hurricane at the maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta-Evgenia, Mexico, and moves north at 19.3 km per hour.
The storm is found with more cool water in the Pacific Ocean and is therefore weakened.
Thus, it is expected that in the strength of tropical storm day or evening, Monday hurricanes will cause a landslide in Mexico.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the total rainfall from Lower California to northwestern Sonora will be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, places perhaps up to 25.4 cm," reportsweather.com.
Rosa will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, get the Arizona border early in the morning as tropical depression, which will continue through Arizona and late in the evening will reach southern Utah.
"The ultimate danger expected of Rose or her remainder is very heavy rains in Nizhny California, Northwestern Sonori and southwest American desert," reports the National Hurricanes Center.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening torrential flooding and refuse in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Middlesomer Norton: Four people have been arrested who attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old guy with a knife wound was found in Somerset.
A wounded teenager was found in the Exelsior Terras area in Midsomer Norton about 04:00 at the British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in stable condition.
17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at the Radstock District at night, reported police to Avona and Somerseta.
Police are asked to respond to anyone who can have any video recording of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Cavano's "endurance and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The Voice for Judge Cavano is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at the rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavano "endurance and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the promotion process.
Cavano testified before Congress on Thursday, furiously and emotionally denying the charges of Christine Blazi Ford in that he committed sexual violence on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day, "American people saw brilliantness, character and courage" Cavano.
"Gloss for Judge Cavano is a vote for one of the most perfect lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a sterling public service experience," he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly mentioned Cavano's rise when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans' appearances in the Midterm election.
"After five weeks one of the most important elections in our lives will occur.
I don't run, but I'm really running, ” he said.—
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrat mission is to "oppose and interfere."
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate regarding Cavano's candidacy will take place not later Friday, reported CNN as an assistant to one of Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people died from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of casualties increased
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away in the ocean, when giant waves moved to the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, stated the country's authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting on a beach festival in the city of Pali on Friday, when waves of up to six meters (18 ft) in the dusk broke ashore, killing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami took place after the 7.5-point earthquake.
"When tsunami threats arose yesterday, people were still doing their stuff on the beach and didn't immediately run away, and they were victims," said the briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugoroho, a representative of the Indonesian disaster's destruction agency (BNPB).
"It wasn't just a tsunami, it moved cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that before hitting the coastline, tsunamis went through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To save themselves from the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, adding.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Many buildings and stores have been destroyed, bridges recovered and destroyed, and mosques surrounded by water.
The post office in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of a severe earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the tsunami's strength, said the agency.
Nugroho named the loss "broadmastable" and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the debris of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the victims and damage could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coast line north of Palu in the area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
"The communication lines were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000,000 people live there, said in the Red Cross statement, and added that his staff and volunteers went to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger," says the report.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that the tsunami hit the Palm, although officials said the waves came at the time specified in advance.
On amateur footage that people shared on social media, you can see a man on the upper floor of the house screaming a furious warning of a tsunami approaching people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall crashed into the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
In Reuters, they couldn't immediately check the quality of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious decommissioning of electricity, which severed the bonds around the Pala, which made it difficult to coordinate rescue actions.
Military personnel began sending freight aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, reported to the authorities, but evacuated people still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was opened only to help, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Uidodo was to visit evacuation centers in Palm on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala managed to reach the city of Palu, where they hide in the tares set in the courtyard of their office, but along the way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he shared.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to take decisive action to eliminate the aftermath of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Paw.
Under Indonesian rules, funding, supply, and provision of personnel from overseas can only begin in case the site of the disaster is announced to the national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“ It is still a disaster at the level of the province, ” noted Aula Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross. —
Once the government says "Okay, this is a national disaster," we will be able to take international aid, but this status is not yet granted."
The second night fell down on the Pali following the Friday earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would adorn these grim plots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was retrieved from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers received a woman lying under the stones with her mother's body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national team of paraplanerism, trained two missing paraplaners to participate in Asian games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplaners who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in paraplanerism, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon tells how a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which had spread among the Paraplaners community, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp opponents of Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, his report was noted for only one grey gall rather than double blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 in exchange for the bank at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brecker employee who ran a bank in Newport on the Leeve, reports Newport Police Department news.
The car driver emptied the bankroom in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "came up behind to Brecker's fellow" and stole a sack of money designed to fill.
The Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the crime scene is on the news, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these individuals should address the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: Reper changes his name to Ye
Reper Canier West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, announcing the change in Twitter, he wrote, "The more officially known as Kie West".
The 41-year-old West was called Ye for a while, and he used this contraction as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place the day before he appeared in the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces Arian Grande's co-host who cancelled her participation because of the "emotional causes", the show's author reported.
It is not just a reduction in the present professional name, West used to say that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that "he" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing the name of his album with the radio-leading Big Boy. —
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanie, which means "the only," was reduced to just Ye, is just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanie is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deady, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen Love's name and Braser Law.
A former colleague of West, JEI-ZI, also experimented with defiss and capital letters.
President of Mexico Andreas Manuel Lopez Obrador promises not to use an army against civilians
The newly elected Mexico president Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the slaughter of students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador, on Tlatelolco Square, promised "never to use an army to suppress the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people, while the left student movements began to be founded throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who are studying, and by opening more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead youths to criminal groups.
United States should double funding in artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing activity in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, considers investors and practitioners in AI Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments were given after various parts of the U.S. government made claims on AI, although there is no formal strategy in the U.S. field of AI at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it seeks to become No. 1 in innovation in the AI field until 2030.
"Two-day AI research budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are much behind the United States, and we're preparing for the next breakthrough in AI field," Lee said.
The doubling of funding can double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement will be made in the United States, said Lee in the CNN interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Nations of AI: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month Houghtton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Sinovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that played the best American player at Otello, and was later executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee noted previous technology competitions conducted by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for advanced defensive research projects (DARPA), and asked when the next would be to help determine the next promising participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations," he remarked.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies in recent years hire lights from universities to work on AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policies can also help the U.S. to increase efforts in AI.
"I believe Green Carton should automatically offer science candidates in AI," he said.
The State Council of China has published its new generation artificial intelligence plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences in China provides funding to individuals who work in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations distribute money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Common Center of Intelligent Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from industry and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Intelligent Intelligence Committee.
Also this month in DARPA, an investment of $2 billion in AI next initiative was announced.
As for the National Science Fund, it now invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Legislative Authority, who wanted to create a National Security Commission of artificial intelligence, did not take any steps for a few months.
The Macedonians vote on a referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia on Sunday voted on a referendum on whether the country's name would be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow for a long-year dispute with Greece to block Macedonia's opportunity for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and imposed the veto on the introduction of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made a deal based on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents of the agreement claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote on the referendum, and because of the boyship campaign, doubts arise whether the voter's appearance would reach minimum 50%, which would allow the referendum to be considered valid.
A question in a referendum bullet reads, "Do you support membership in NATO and the EU under the terms of accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should be paid to enter organs such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the European Union's e-election, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski in Skopje.
Although the vote result does not carry legal obligations, sufficient members of parliament said they would support it to make it decisive.
Two-thirds of the vote in Parliament will be required to change the name.
The State Election Commission stated that prior to 1:00 p.m., there were no reports of violations.
However, the opening was only 16% compared to 34% in the recent 2016 parliamentary election when 66% of registered voters dropped their ballots into the urn.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said the 62-year-old constituency of Gyoze Tanewski in the capital of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumit, Macedonia, the prime minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Doucha gave their vote on the referendum on changing the country's name, which will open the way to enter NATO and the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud raised head, not through service doors," said Kavardarkov. —
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can address others, like China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration."
The Prime Minister of Zayv believes that membership in NATO will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment rates are over 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will vote for because more than 80% of our citizens are acting for the EU and NATO," said Zayv after voting.
He noted that the result of "yes" would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies in Macedonia, 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the need.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote for.
In order for referendum to be recognized as valid, the opening must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure at the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since the beginning of his work in May last year.
See: Serhio Aguero of Manchester City runs the entire Brayton defense and scores a goal
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have been defended by Breitton and brought the Manchester City win at 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguro's goal at the 65th minute of the match looked like a funny simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brayton defenders and found himself in the open field.
Aguaro then realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He bypassed one defender, then ran around a few more at the edge of the Broadon penalty.
He went on to make a pass to the left, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penalty to hand over Aguero's ball, which his right-handed fortune launched him into the right-hand part of the gate, defeating the Briton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguaro has some foot problems," said the reporters manager of the City of Pep Guvardillo.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky he scored the goal at this moment."
But the initial advantage of the sky blue in this Premier League match provided Sterling.
This goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguaro received the ball deep in Brayton's territory.
He sent a beautiful passing pass along Lera Sane's left flank.
Leroy made several touchs and went on to make a pass of Sterling towards the far pants.
Forward of the sky-blues threw the ball into the gate as soon as he slipped outside.
The City will meet with Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Championships League at 12:55 Tuesday at the Rein-Nekkar-Aren Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take points from Roxis
Since the Washington Nashinals team came out of the play-off, there was no substantial reason to wait for another start.
But prone to competition, Sherzer hopes to get out on a piter bitter Sunday in a game against Colorado Rockies on the condition that the Rockies will still have trouble getting out to the play-off. Now the Ricos are on one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
"Roxes" at least have a Wild Card for winning 5-2 over "Nachonals" on Friday evening, but still seeks to secure the title of the first division.
"In spite of what we play for, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how viewers behave here in Denver, and another team will probably play the highest level I've seen in the whole year.
Why don't I want to take part in this competition?
"Schools" will still announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they tend to be Sherzer.
Sherzer, for whom this would be the 34th start, had a pitching session on Thursday and could play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
Washington's right-handed is the result of 18-7 of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-auts in 2202 inning inning in this season.
Mitinga Trump in West Virginia
The president briefly mentioned the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans' followers' appearance in the midterm election.
"All we've done will be put on a map in November.
Five weeks later, one of the most important elections in our lives will occur.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm everywhere I can, fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it's happening now.
And they're firmly set to turn power, using any means, you see the subsidy, the crotch.
They don't care who's suffering them, who needs to go over to gain power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them."
The mission of Democrats, he said, is to "oppose and interfere."
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "sick and mean, disgusting and lying."
He mentioned the Senate Court Committee, calling the Democrat Senator Diane Finestein by name, prompting the audience on loud cries of discontent.
"Remember her answer?
Did you give the document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting - it was really a bad language of the bodies moves - the worst language of the bodies I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is untolerant to those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to convict me, it almost became a surprise.
Eventually, I'm the last of those Parliament's Labour members to be informed that they are not welcome, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
Joan Ryan, a member of my Parliament, was treated almost the same way because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, these issues are ironicly similar to those of which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a report on a meeting of the Nottingham East Labour, Friday says, "We want meetings to be inculatory and productive."
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labourists were just like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of "more kind, more soft" politics has long been forgotten if it was ever done at all.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate differing views and each opinion is rated from the position of whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, the colleges, which I had previously thought had similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take a position that I would never agree with, whether national security or the only EU market.
Always, when I'm speaking publicly — and it doesn't matter what I say — is followed by a yead of assaults on social media with calls to revocation, condemnation of the center policy, I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because I'm being addressed to comments usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the flow of sexist or racist attacks every day, but never give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is that the standards of abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Labour Party should raise the culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and with every movement "unbelieve" or changing the rules of selection the party narrows.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been called on not to grow up, not to express myself so loud as to have "all been well with me."
But I didn't come into politics for that.
I joined the Labours 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because because because of the lack of attention from the government, Thatcher my class in high school literally collapsed, since then I have sought to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether it be a local advisor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has confused my political views and differences with current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday events, I only want to say one thing: in terms of a country stepping towards Brexit, which would harm households, businesses, and government services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Nottingham's Monument, but for my voters, as members of the Labour Party, and no: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no threat will cause me and no political benefit to act in accordance with what I consider the best interests of you all.

Air 38 - 17 "Melroses": Unbeated Eyr climbs up
The last two attempts may have distorted the final result, but no doubt the Eir has won the triumph in today's wonderful entertainment game Premiership Scotland.
Now they head the table, it's the only unbeatable team of ten.
After all, the excellent defense and improved ability to use the odds gives the hosts and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be content.
"So far we've been tested by our games, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be content," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrouse commented, "Give it to "Eyr", they better used chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, implemented by Fresier Clemo, brought Eyr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, published by Verriors, allowed the Mallrose to show figures, and Jason Baggott used an unrealamized attempt.
The climate increased Air leadership with penalty and right before the break made and implemented solo test, which gave a score of 17-5 in favor of Eir
But Melrouz began the second time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggoth, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a delay due to the serious injury of Ruriad Knott, who was taken out of the field on the stretchs, and from the Eyr's restart came forward through Stafford McDaull's attempt, which was implemented by Clemo.
Captain Eyr Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and once again the Melrouses forced another player to pay an unregulated attempt by Bruce Colwyn under intense pressure.
The hosts returned, however, when Strauan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the rechub Klemo without a ball from the penalty line, McCerson made a touchdown behind the May Eir.
Klemo implemented an attempt that he did almost every time after the restart, then Kyle Rowe received a blowout from David Armstrong in the box and sent a flanker to Gregor Henry for a fifth attempt by the host team.
Looks like the show's star Still Game is set for a new career in the restaurant field.
Looks like the star of the series Still Game Ford Kiran is set for a new career in hospitality, and that is the conclusion that comes after it is known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC television series, a script he writes to and in which he is filmed with the ancient comedy partner Greg Hamfield.
Duet announced that the future ninth series would be the last in the series, and it seems Kirnan plans life after Crejling.
According to the official record, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source in Scottish Sun indicated that Kirnan wanted to enter Glasgow's "brighting restaurant business".
"Moro ours: Internal Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol an equipped fleet headquarters in La Pas.
Public buildings hang ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titika to the Amazon are painted with a motto: "The mass is our right.
We have to get it back."
In Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline that left Chile in the 19th century bloody conflict due to natural resources, and there is also a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, since Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision on 1 October after five years of reviewing the case.
"There's an impulse in Bolivia, there's a spirit of unity and quiet and of course it's looking forward to a positive outcome," commented Roberto Calstadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the MKI decision on large screens across the country. They hope that the tribunal in Hague will make a decision in favor of Bolivia, that after decades of interim conversations, Chile will be forced to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Moreáles, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced a rival against his reelection in the following year, also puts great hope for a decision that will be announced on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if that happens, little will change.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to condemn Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the MCI decision, only six months after the final arguments were given, indicates that the case was "not difficult," told Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Bolivia's case has not advanced; the last four years could have contributed to the withdrawal.
"The prospect of access to the sea was used by the present Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
The warlord Morles detonated the remains of Chilean kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
The two countries have not traded ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltze, a representative of Bolivia in Gaza, did not agree that the ruling of the court was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will get "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and the chance to end 139 years of differences, receiving mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadiya also denied that Moreles — still another of Latin America’s most popular presidents — had used the marine issue as a political favor.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This determination is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ring Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leader of the substantarian countries.
His comments appeared when the U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of a nuclear diplomacy restart that has entered a dead corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen In.
Ri says that belief that the continuation of sanctions and the U.S. declarations of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on the knees is a "independent dream".
Washington is afraid to accept a declaration before Phenyan takes significant steps from disarmament.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a widespread skepticism that Phenyan takes seriously the rejection of his arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to secure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan the following month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
On Paris fashion shows, they presented the last trend of massive lead constituency, which is already heading the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or hide completely from the sun, you've found what you need.
Designors Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of eccentric lead election in the oversaise style from the 2019 spring-lit collection on the performance of the brilliant Paris week of fashion.
Very impractical hates have filled Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their mind-blowing creations beyond the podium.
Valentino isolated himself with an exclusive beige hat with broad decorated feathers of fields that covered the heads of the models.
Among the others are the overseys-acsessors decorated with precious stones of the melon, the witch's hat and even the banner hat, but they're not to keep the head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the assortment of the original masks — just in time before Hebron.
Many of these colorful masks had stitched lips and were more like the Hannibal Lekter than the high fashion.
One creature was like an equipment for underwater swimming with tubes and glasses, and the other was like a ice cream drop that melts.
And if you support this serious fashion statement, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go to the main streets of your city.
Oversaise cappeds entered fashion thanks to the Lion Bombi, a straw hat with fields of six feet sixty cm wide, which they saw on all: from Rianna to Emily Ratagekowski.
A ball brand behind a very impractical hat, which could be seen everywhere on social networks, gave peace to another creature: a straw beach bag about the size of a model in a bathing suit that carried it.
A bag of yellow-red fradi with a bacre from the pharmia and white leather handle was a central element of La Riviera's collection spring-lit 2019 brand Jacquemus on the Paris week of fashion.
The celebrity Stylist Luke Armigage told FEMAIL: "The next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the cities, because the designer's influence is so great that it will be difficult to ignore demand for the overseasure.
John Edward: knowledge of language is mandatory for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland support high standards of learning, and in 2018 have again received excellent results of examinations that complement individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which teach over 30,000 students across Scotland, are presented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SRDS), and they seek to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education chosen by them as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable on the choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person of the language that she understands, she perceives it in her mind.
If you speak to her in her own language, she perceives it in her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't only use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year's exams, we see that in independent schools, language is leaded in the rankings of the best scored subjects.
Overall, 68% of the students who studied foreign languages received a higher A score.
Data collected in 74 SRNS schools showed that 72% of students received A's top score from Chinese, and 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French, and 63% of those who study Spanish, also received A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland regard foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now language as a choice subject is taught just as NTIM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), as part of independent school programs and other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close the vacances associated with the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for future careers.
As more promising positions require knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of a chosen career, if someone learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives the person who speaks several languages the advantage over competitors.
According to a 2013 survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% could not speak in a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by ambiguous percentage of people (15%).
That's why investment in language teaching is now important for kids today.
Learning several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will have its own language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always choose several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scottish Independent schools try to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with skills necessary to achieve success regardless of what has prepared them for the future.
Now it can't be denied that in the international business media language, it continues to have vital importance for the future of the country, so it should be shown in education.
Modern languages must really be considered "the skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, variety, and perfection to Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le fire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
Leebron debuts with Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see Leebrone James's first launch for Los Angeles Lakers almost waited.
Leakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first preseason match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play is not decided yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Leakers Reporter Mike Trudell reported that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Guides games.
"At this stage of my career to prepare I don't need pre-season games," he replied.
Mitinga Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today begins a series of pre-election rallies from the city of Weiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled for the next week of Trump rallys, including rallies in friendly-advised states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidate proposed by him to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump seeks to form support for future midterm elections, since Republicans risk losing control of Congress after voting in November.
At what hour will Trump's tonight rally in West Virginia be held and how to view it on the Internet?
Mitting Trump in the city of Wieling in West Virginia scheduled for 19 hours in eastern time today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online on live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to remember the intense hearings that took place this week over a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cawano, accused of sexual harassment, and of deferring the vote of Senate for a week while the FBI is under investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans with gaining popularity before the election in November.
President Trump's representatives said these five rallies were aimed the following week to "activate volunteers and supporters, because Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," reports Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so critical for its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the strained season of the pre-election campaign approaches," said Reuters representative of Trump campaign, who did not want to call his name.
At a planned Wesbanko Arena Stadium in the city of Weiling today's rally, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be the second in the last month by Trump's visit to West Virginia, in which he scored more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump tries to help the candidate from Republicans to the Western Virginia Senate Patrick Morcis, whose rankings are based on surveys.
"It's not good for Morris that the president comes to raise his rating in polls," commented Reuters Simon Heather, a political scientist from the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team set to fight and full of hopes before Sunday singles
After three sessions ending in a one-way win, the afternoon Saturday forks can become exactly what Ryder's Cup lacked.
The tailal pendulum of the pulse is a fully fictional sports concept that players really believe in, especially in similar competitions.
So when they say that the pulse works?
"They were ahead for six points, and now at four, so I think we're taking it a little bit like an impulse," said Jordan Spyt as we entered.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, says Spit, feel a bit of wind in their sails, also a lot of them encouraging, not the least of the shape of Spita and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
The spin with his killer strikes from the little guy to the gron shows an example.
These guttural cries of celebration became louder when, in continuing his round, he made a crucial patt and leveled the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas had retreated into two points.
His hood, which allowed them to win a 15-walk match, met with a similar scream, such as tells you that the American team doesn't give up.
"You really just have to put forth a lot of effort and worry about your own match," Spit said.
That's all each of these players left right now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spin and Thomas have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot suppose to be wrong.
The Molly was the only couple who didn't make the boygi on Saturday afternoon, they also managed to avoid the boygi in the morning on Saturday and after lunch on Friday and for nine last holes on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back, sets the belief that they will win on Sunday and that there will no longer be popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to reinforce the potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
It's a pleasure both at the same time on different holes.
However, to speak of the triumph of Europeans before it is too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt with Sergio Garsia, the hero of the morning forballs when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One boygie and two miles in the first nine holes brought a Spaniard and a swede to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Forballs and forsaks are very interesting to see close-up through the interaction between the couple's participants, through the advice they give, advice they don't give, and also interesting to watch how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe currently plays better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of forsoms has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight, which some, especially Americans, have doubts about.
Europe leads on 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe's Cup will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's forballs and forts, it is ahead of the United States with a 10-6 score.
Inspired by the duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the retired Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to return the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning forballs with a 3-1 score.
The United States resisted more in forshores and won two games but failed to cut the gap.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (with Mollywood) are only the second couple to score four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in the fortballs, they merged to defeat the wild Woods and the American-born Brison Deschambo with even more effective 5th4.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturday, demonstrated random bursts of genius, but he currently lost 19 of his 29 matches in forballs and forss and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in morning forballs, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in forsoms to receive a 2th-rate loss from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coek, who are the first and third in the world rating.
Europe was unable to do everything in its own way this pleasant fresh day on the south-west of Paris.
Three times, the chief winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They gained a decisive 2ta1 victory over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in the forbs and later defeated Poulter and Rory Maclroy with 4th3 in forks, losing two first holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned with a four-point deficit, though the Furrick team only needs a draw.
However, after the second seat for two days, the counter attack on Sunday looks as if it were beyond their power.
North Korea says that "no way" will not disarm in a one-way order without trust
North Korea's foreign minister on Saturday reported to the UN that the extension of the sanctions has increased distrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country will never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ring Ho told the UN's annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea had introduced "substantive measures of good will", such as the end of nuclear and missile testing, a nuclear test site and commitment not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"One, we don't see the appropriate reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm in one-way order."
And although Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "potap" approach to denoclelarization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for the gradual steps, his statement proved to be important to the fact that it did not reject the one-way deunicleralization that made Phenyan in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Chen's joint statement, and Donald Trump on the first in history of the summit between the real President of the United States and North Korea's leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called on to work on "denuclelarization of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea seeks the formal end of the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Phenyan originally has to give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls to weaken hard international sanctions on North Korea.
"U.S. insists on "denucularization at first" and raises the pressure level by using sanctions to achieve its goal violently, and even deny "proclaiming the end of war," said Ree.
"To think that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the sequel of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed in the United States at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister called attention to the three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae In in the last five months and added, "If the side in this issue of denoclelarization were South Korea, and not the United States, the denocleralization of the Korean peninsula would not go into such a deaf corner."
Despite this, the tone of Ree's performance differed sharply from the previous when he told the General Assembly that aiming North Korea's missiles on the continental part of the United States was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a man-raquet" who wants to commit suicide.
This year in the UN Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for the courage to take advantage of the disarming measures last year, but said that much more would be needed and sanctions must remain in force to denocleralize North Korea.
Wednesday Trump noted that he does not set the time frame for this: "It takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia state that the United Nations Security Council is to reward Pyngang for taking steps.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "Election of the Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and steadily until we see a complete, final, confirmed denocleralization".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block funding for nuclear programs and beam rockets of Phenenna.
Pompeo met Ree in the United Nations General Assembly and then said that the following month he would visit Phenyan again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Phenyan in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for "gangster demands".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to disassemble the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States would use "responsible measures".
He told us that, according to Kim, he needed "responsible measures" to ensure that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University in this year provided all of his students with more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight a growing culture of cool learning all night after caffeine gas.
The instructor found that university students number one in the world are often ignorant when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigam Hospital of Women, developed a course that he felt was the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end, one girl approached him and said, "Why do I have to be told this now, at the last course?"
"She told me that nobody had ever told her about the importance of sleep that surprised me," shared the teacher from The Telegraph.
On the course, which was first introduced this year, students explain the basis of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Medical Services at the University, said that the university decided to enter the course after it was revealed that students were seriously deprived of sleep for a week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one chapter, there is a picture of a room in a dorm room where students click cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficits on sports performances, and the importance of routine related to sleep.
Another chapter tells participants how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The chart on the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior instantly.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride for "tossing all night" still exists, he added, and also noted that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is increasing.
An adequate sleep of good quality must be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with a set of excess weight, since sleep deprivation moves the brain into a hunger regime that causes constant physical hunger, he told.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler to develop the course after she enrolled at one of his other courses last year during the first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will turn to all graduate students to ask for a similar training program before coming into a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students put on reminders that they have to go to bed as well as put on the alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circus rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Riverston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerard's boys
Rangers survived another assault of exit sorrow: the strike of Dolly Menga brought a distinguished team of Stephen Jerrard defeat with a 1-0 score from the Lavingstone.
The Aybrox team wanted to win its first out-of-the-way win after the February triumph over St. Johnston with a 4-1 score, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerard second as a manager of 18 games. Gerard's team remained eight points behind the leaders of the Scottish Premiership Harts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lacked inspiration, did not look as if the score could be leveled.
The Rangers now went down to the sixth position, and the Lionston rose to the third, and at the difference of the balls, they are only preceded by Hibernian.
Additionally, Rangers may encounter another unpleasantness, because the lineman Kalum Spence was forced to cultivate the head wound after a guest sector had been thrown into it by some object.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that once passed the Air in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same composition of the Lion 11, which took one point in Harts last week, and was thrilled at how his forced boys oppressed rivals at every step.
The Rangers may have dominated the ownership of the ball, but the Riverston worked more with the resulting ball.
They were supposed to kill in just two minutes of the game when Menga's first pass in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gates of Allan McGorre, but the half-operator wasted this great chance sending the ball past the gate.
The deep free kick of Kegan Jacobs reached Craig Halkett's skipper, but his defense partner Alan Litgo hit his rear pants
Rangers really got control, but on the last third there were more hopes than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get the penalty right on the label for a quarter of an hour after a collision with Stephen Laules, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the call of the columber.
The Rangers managed to make only two punches on the goal in the first taim, but the former Aybrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, hit the head of Lassana Kulibali and a calm strike by Ovie Edjaria had hardly bothered.
And although the larger goal of the Riverstone for 34 minutes may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it only by their hard work.
Rangers failed again to deal with Jacobs' cooking.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Meng for a simple ending.
In the break, Gerard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost worked out immediately as the viger went through to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came from his line to block him.
However, the Riverston continued to force visitors to play the same game they like when Litgo and Halkettt make one long pass after another.
Holt's team could improve the result in the last stages, but McGorg was a good resister of Jacobs before Litgo hit the corner.
Glenn Middlelton, a replacement in Rangers, made another late bid for a fine when faced with Jacobs, but Thomson took a look again.
Almanach: inventor of Geiger's counter
And now a page from our Almanac Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago on that day, and time goes... in Germany, the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, Gaeger's licients have become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Bell Coronado with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play the questionables in the look of cowboy scientists.
Man: "What is it at all?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can really hear how radioactive atoms are affected in minerals."
Evans: "Well, well, it's really cracking right now!"
Gans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer may teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new vaccine against cancer may teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, which are part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and their change in the laboratory
These cells are then able to see a protein that is common to many types of cancer.
A test vaccine demonstrates promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can "see" shared protein cancers (HER2), and further re-election of these patients.
Professor J. Berzofski of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer Betesda, Maryland, noted: "Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine."
"HER2 "stimulates multiple cancers growth, including breast cancer, ovarians, lung and colactial cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which consists of removed immune cells in patients and "learning" them to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show in the MAGAA Kanje West made a sharp speech to support President Trump,
What caused the audience's negative reaction
The audience at the SNL show studio (Subly Tuesday night in live air) was educated by Kanie after his mournful performance, during which he praised President Donald Trump and said that he would run for presidential post in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball labeled "Let's restore America to former glory", he exploded in a council in which he criticized Democrats, and again stated his support of Trump.
"It's often during conversation that whites ask me, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I had been bothered by racism, I would have long since left America," he said.
The SNL show was started by Matt Damon's cricketer, in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Cavano, which he gave before the Legal Committee of the Senate in the case for the lawsuit of Christine Bleizi Ford on violent acts of sexual nature.
Although West's speech was not broadcast on live air, a video with his council posted on social network comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to mock West by placing this post.
West also complained to viewers that behind the scenes there was an unpleasant situation due to the head covering.
As reported by Washington Examiner, West stated, "When I was behind the scenes, I was rudely treated.
I was told, "Don't go out to the audience in this baseball."
They mistreated me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed keep quiet."
The West went on to say, "You want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'm going to put on my superman baseball because that's how no one can tell me what to do.
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused the audience's negative reaction in the hall, and the performance actors of the SNL looked confused, and one of the viewers said, "There was a dead silence in the studio."
West was invited at the last minute to replace Arian Grande's singer, whose former boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days before airing.
West caused in many surprise by performing the song I Love it (I love it) in a Perrier water bottle suit.
Westa supported the head of the conservative organization of PUSA Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the boldest: Thank YOU THAT TO BE SUPPORT OF NATO."
Instead, she wrote on Twitter to the talk show that West "is who he is, and it's just great."
"Well, I'm not going to reward him (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art"), who I think is practicing and erupting an ideology which harms my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Prior to the show, the reper announced on Twitter what changed the name: he is now "the one previously known as Canie West".
West – not the first artist to change the name; he follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Deady, Puffy, and Pi Diddy.
The colega rapper Snoop Dogg was previously named Snoop Lyon, and it is known that the music legend of the last decades Prines changed the name into a symbol, and then became "Artist, formerly known as Prince".

The star of the "Gra of the Thrones" by Keith Herington condemns idealization of brutality
Keith Gerington became famous for his role as a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "The Hor of the Thrones" of the production of HBO.
However, a 31-year-old performance actor with the condemnation of a macho hero's stereotype, claiming that because of such heroes on screen, young boys often seem to have to be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit stated that in his view "something went wrong," and asked how to address the problem of idealization of brutality in the era of hashtag #MeTo (#iano, #jatege, etc.).
Keith, who recently married his colleague at the Grey Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, noted that he was "fully determined" to deal with this problem.
"I'm currently quite determined, when we're on the slippery path of the idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up through the lens of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He went on to say, "What is natural and what do we have?
Why does television and the street teach that young boys feel pressure to be such?
I think today is a really important question, "How can we change this?"
Because it's obvious that young boys have gone astray."
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any prickwells and sidvels of "Gri thrones" after the show ended the show the following summer, since "he had already finished with battles and horses."
Since November, Keith has played in the production of "The True West" by Sam Shepard – stories of a film producer and his citizen brother.
As an actor recently confessed, he considers meeting his wife Rose as the best that he received from participating in the series "The Horse of the Thrones."
"When I was filming in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life," said Keith.
In the fantasy series, which received Emmy awards, Rose played Igritt – the love of Heroington's hero John Snow.
The couple were in June 2018, and the ceremony was held in the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases of disease
China has reported a 14% drop in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, there are a total of more than 80,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in past trends.
For a long time in some parts of China, HIV was quickly distributed through contaminated blood during transfusions.
However, according to official health officials during the conference held in the province of Yunnan, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has grown to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through time is a serious problem for Chinese LGBT community.
The decryminization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to the study, 70–90% of men who have sexual relations with other men are still marrying women due to domination in a country of conservative values.
The transmission of disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of protection tools during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, seeing in part the solution to the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the release of Republican senators' data into the network by her staff and subservient the "unsafe lie" and "the theory of conspiracy"
On Saturday, a member of the United States House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, condemned the loud statements that one of its state workers posted personal data to three American Republican senators on their pages in Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat states that these statements spread "ultrarights" to political viewers and websites.
"Breach, lies, and then even more disgusting lies," said Waters on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Getch of Utah.
The data appeared on the net on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from Capitol during the hearings of the Senate Commission on charges of illegal sexual acts committed against Brett Kavano, a U.S. Supreme Court candidate.
The leaking occurred some time after three senators questioned Kawano.
The Hill publication reported that on conservative websites such as Gatesway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the source of the leak had been linked to the Waters office and was able to find the data of her state colleague.
"These baseless claims – absolute lies, they do not match reality," continued Waters.
"My office's half-worker, whose personal data and security are being threatened as a result of these fake and lying statements, has nothing to do with the source of this information.
These baseless claims – absolute lies, they are not true."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the network, among others also expressed a former press secretary of the White House Arie Fleischer.
"This denial is full of anger," Fleisher wrote.
"It suggests that, with that nature, she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not act arrogantly.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He should stay calm and uninhibited."
Looks like Fleischer was conducting parallels between Waterers' reaction and the critic of Democrats at the address of Judge Cavano, who was accused of being too angry during hearings on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican party candidate running to take the Voeters place on the results of intermediate elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is so news if everything is true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters noted that her office had already reported "responsible state authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements."
"We will do all we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they have responded before the law for their actions which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of the film "Agent Johnny Inglisch: New Mission" – Passing parody for spy militants with Rowena Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to seek in every new British film a thought inspired by Brexit, and there they are in the new part of a series of comedy parodys on the militants about Johnny Inglisz, the first film called "Jonny Inglish" to go on screen as early as 2003, later the series resumed in 2011, taking away "Johnnie Inglish: Relaunch".
Will it be a mocking-ironic self-satisficer on what we are ignorant, the new export potential of the nation?
In any event, Johnny Inglish with his moving face and his elongated eyes was given the second time to make a mess, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
Jonny is known to be – a ruthlessly fun secret agent in which, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, there is a little from Inspector Cluso, just from Mr. Bean and a lot of things – from that guy who played one note of tunes from the film "Woked Crows" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
A typical character is also a traveller and mystery of international scale, which has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in the long-lost television commercial of Barclayard.
In the last film about Johnny Inglisha there are several beautiful moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglish in the knighty armor was approaching the helicopter and the screw blades were blowing on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent is nicely unveiled in the film, however the humor of the pass, and at some times it is too much, especially when compared to the "serious" moviebrands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission impossible", one of the "insidents" who are also comedy.
It is as if jokes are intended for children rather than adults, and I find foolish attacks that happen to Johnny Inglishech not seem as ingenious and thoughtful as Atkinson's docks in the silent films about Bina.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat looming over Britain.
In the British supersecret network of spies, the hacker penetrates and reveals the names of all field agents, which has become a complete surprise for the active agent (for regrettably, Kevin Eldon played only a scene role in the film).
This proved to be the last drop for the Prime Minister – a haughty person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to convey the image as best he could, inspired by Teresa May, however the script did not allow him to fully reveal it).
The intelligence boards informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she had to engage someone from the retired.
The choice falls on awkward Johnny Inglisha, who now works as a teacher at some super-supposed facility and unofficially teaches the children operational work under cover (in this part of the spy's 'school of the year' Inglisha for teenagers there were several successful jokes).
Inglisha is quickly taken to Whitehol for the emergency briefing, where he meets again with his long-term friend Baf, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine captain (the role of an existentated narcissist person does not exactly match Vicki Pepperdin's talent).
So when everything in her Majesty's Secret Service went to the cruising, Batman and Robin return in formation and suddenly face the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletov, who is played by Olga Kurilenko.
And during this time, the Prime Minister comes under the chart of the charismatic billionaire who earned his fortune in technology and technology and claims that he can address the problem with the British network – the villain Jason Volta, who was played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Baf go on a trip and use their ridiculous tricks again: overdressed by waiters they make a fire in the shrill French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally going outside the border on the luxurious Volta's boat; Inglish is doing real mess as he tries to use the helmet of virtual reality to get familiar with the planning of Volta's house.
All stops bring us down to the last episode, but his kindness and violence reminds us of the film for children.
It's a passing film.
As I watched other films about Johnny Inglisha, I asked myself the same question: Can the British film industry not offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labourists deny the preparation of a plan by which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days
The Labour Party Jeremy Corbin is scheduled to discuss a radical plan by which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to commit company leaders to transfer funds saved as a result of an artificial intelligence revolution, to employees, giving them an extra outage.
Thus, the workers will have a three-day out and will bring home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea corresponds to the party's economic programme and directs the country's resources to support the working class.
The four-day workweek has been approved at the British Congress of Third Juniors, and it is feared that this will enable workers to benefit from the changes in the general economy.
The source in the Labour Party reported the publication of The Sunday Times as follows: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day workweek corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labourists were not the first to endorse this idea, since the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day workweek during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment endorse such a desire.
Spiker of the Labour Party said, "In the political program of the party, there is no provision for the establishment of a four-day workweek, so now we don't look at this idea."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election meeting of the Labour Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was set to take power back from the "no-titled directors" of communal businesses and "experts."
The "Tin's" plan of the Chancellor also means that the shareholders of the water supply companies may not get all their fortune if the Labour government sets a "counting" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include workers in company rule and to create inclusive accommodation funds to pass 10% of the conventional private sector firms to workers waiting for an annual division of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy relate on the show 60 Minutes (60 minutes), whether the investigation of Kavano case, held by the FBI, can change their opinion
Due to the investigation of the prosecution against Judge Brett Kavano, who leads the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as Supreme Court judge is postponed for at least a week.
On Sunday show, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelli asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his fellow from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavano.
I called him after the whole thing happened and came up with that charge, and I asked him, "Did you really do this?"
He was determined, steadfast, uncompromising."
Graham's opinion seems to no longer change.
"I believe Cavano's prosecution is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Forde, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it, – added Graham, turning to Christine Blazy Ford. –
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under the oath.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect the decrease in poverty?
On this Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival festival (The World's Citizens Festival) – an annual event in the music world with a stunning number of star performers and no less dramatic mission – to combat poverty worldwide.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival Festival, tens of thousands of people will be mobbed at the Grand Haven of Central Park, not only to enjoy Janet Jackson's performances, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the true goal of the festival – organizers seek to combat the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival Festival Festival, which started in 2012, is a sequel to Global Everty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors must perform a series of tasks or "works" as they take on a volunteer project, write an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or whatever else to help draw attention to the purpose of the organization – the elimination of poverty.
So, are there any results, because there are 12 years left to reach the goal of the Global Citizens?
Is it really another case of so-called "clicitivism" when people feel that they are really changing something by signing electronic petition or making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 they have recorded 19 million "works" of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to claim planned financial assessations and programs worth more than $37 billion, which will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by the year 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 financial obligations and public statements as an example of the results of their activities, with at least 10 billion already being collected and spent.
A group of estimated funds have already directly affected the lives of some 649 million people worldwide.
A major financial commitment may include The Power of Nutriation (State Force), which is territorially relevant to Britain. As part of the project, investors and realists committed to "help children grow up" and promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million help to cope with malnutrition problems after receiving more than 4,700 messages in Twitter from the Global Cities organization.
"In support of the government of Great Britain, patrons, governments of other countries and citizens of the world such as you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history," said the representative of The Power of Nutrion Tracy Ullman, speaking before the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "works" that called for improved nutrition of mothers and children, the UK government announced the fundraising for The Power of Nation project to improve the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can beat the extreme level of poverty?",
The Global Citizens wrote, "It's a long and difficult way, so sometimes we'll fall down and fail.
However, like the participants in civil rights movements and against apartheid to us, we will succeed because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, the band The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Giangelle Mona – this is only a part of the star performers that will perform this year at the New York Festival and lead him Deborah-Lie Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
Interior Minister has stated that the United States can use naval forces for "blocks" to prevent the exports of Russian energy sources
According to a quote by U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington can turn for help to the naval forces to prevent the release of Russian energy markets, including Middle East markets.
Zinke stated that Russia's participation in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates on the invitation of the legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to mediate energy trade as they already do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address the problem.
"The U.S. naval forces can provide free passage by seaways and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy sources don't go to market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the event participants, which was conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance (Alyses of Consumer Energy Relations) – a non-profit organization that positions itself as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He then compared approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
"Economical strategy for Iran and Russia generally is that we effectively use energy and place it alternative," he said, calling Russia "one-way development" because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these statements were echoing, the Trump administration set out to grow the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by replacing the Russian-born energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To this end, the Tramp administration officials and President Donald Trump himself try to convince the Germany government to abandon the "indemnable" project of building the Highway "North Stream 2" which, Trump said, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the ‘North Stream 2 lawn, ’ which is worth $11 billion and which will double the capacity of existing gas to 110 billion cubic meters, – a purely economic project.
The Kremlin convinces Washington is hotly opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"In my view, we share the opinion that energyress cannot be a tool of pressure and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after meeting U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the Federal Union of German Industry (BDI) has urged the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and two-way agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when the third country intervenes in our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federal Union of the German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Merkel Angels with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren "will think seriously" about bedding for president's post in 2020
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that he would "think seriously" about the president's ballot after an intermediate election.
During a meeting with the public in Golicok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of promoting her candidacy.
As The Hill Warren reported, "It's time for women to go to Washington and get the work done by the government, and for that, there must be a woman on his head."
"After November 6th, I will think seriously about exterminating my candidate for the president's post."
During a meeting with Warren, he expressed his assessment of Donald Trump's presidency, saying that he would "bring his country in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, criticizing Trump and a candidate for the Supreme Court's office, Bretta Cavano.
In the Friday tweet, Warren wrote, "...no doubt, the FBI's vote is to be investigated."
However, according to a survey published on Friday, the majority of Warren's voters do not believe it should run in 2020.
According to a survey jointly conducted by the Saffel University Center for Political Studies and the edition of The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts state have expressed themselves against the promotion of the senator of their candidate.
Thirty-two percent supported promotion.
The results of the survey indicated that the former governor, Deval Patrick, had greater support, for the potential promotion of him to the President's post, was 38%, against – 48%.
During a discussion of the candidate for other well-known Democrats, who may run in 2020, the former vice president Joe Byden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders State is also called.
According to Associated Press, Bayden said that he would make a decision before January.
Sarah Palin mentions the Pittsburgh Trek Palin during a rally to support Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after entering military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"That which is now going through my son, through which he passes upon his return, can only understand other families who are experiencing the effects of the PRSR and other health problems with which our soldiers return home," she stated before the polling participants to support Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest Trek "a problem nobody pays attention to" and said her son and other veterans of war "turning home not as they were before, more violent, and want to know if they respect what their fellow soldiers, pilots and other military personnel have done to this country."
According to a spokesman for the Vasilla Police Department, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as in preventing reports of violence and carrying weapons in the state of alcohol abuse.
18 States and District of Columbia advocate asylum provision policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new U.S. policy, according to which victims of gang persecution and domestic violence are denied the status of a refugee.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and district sent an analytic note to a court consultant in Washington to support a plaintiff who needs asylum and has charged in court order the policy mentioned.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Greys v. Sashns case for the American Civil Rights Union's suit, in which federal policy is charged and which was filed in August, is not revealed.
The summons said that her partner "and his cruel-baked sons" beat her, but U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on 20th July.
She was illegally held in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace's lawsuit said that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (the refugees of whom often seek asylum in the United States) often face serious problems such as gang violence and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy dismisses the 2014 Appeal Board's decision on immigration, which allowed immigrants with no papers escaping domestic violence to request asylum.
Secretary-General of the District of Columbia General Karl Reisin stated during his speech on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state laws, federal and international laws."
"Federal law requires that decisions regarding a refugee's status claim are based on the investigation of the facts and circumstances laid out in such a statement, and the ban violates this principle," is in the analytic record of a court consultant.
Further in an analytic note, prosecutors argue that policies that ban immigrants from entry in the United States are damaging the country's economy because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labor resources."
Attorney-General Jeff Sashns in June issued a decree for immigration judges, which spoke of them no longer being able to grant the status of a refugee to those fleeing domestic violence and gangism.
"The application is given to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," said Sishns during the presentation of politics on June 11.
The provision of asylum was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately seek to find those who remained alive, while the number of deaths in the Palm grew twice as many
For those left alive, the situation continues to worsen.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries the body.
Clean water is scarce."
Some residents return to their ruined homes, reeling their underprivileged belongings, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged as a result of an earthquake with 7.5 points on the Richter scale are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including two Geris with back and shoulder fractures, rest near the building of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are given help under the open skies due to constant repressives.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled how a strong force shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for rescue.
It seems to me that I'm trapped in the debris of the wall," said Geris to correspondent Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife begging for help, and then mastered the silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador blames China for "sexing psychological pressure" with "the props containing propaganda"
A week after the state Chinese newspaper posted on four pages of the American daily edition of advertising material on mutual benefit from the trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump of the last Wednesday referred to the paid addition of the China Daily edition in Des Moines Register – the most popular newspaper in Iowa following China's charges in an attempt to influence the election to Congress that will happen on 6th November. China rejects these charges.
As reported to Reuters agency by officials in the United States, Trump's statements, in which he charges Beijing in an attempt to intervene in American elections, mean a new stage of escalation from Washington, whose purpose is pressure on China.
Although foreign governments can place advertising to activate trade, there is an escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington at the time, as part of which they have already raised the customs to import.
According to experts from China and the United States, in the beginning of this war, the introduction of the repressive customs in China was intended to strike exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party Trump.
Terry Brensted, U.S. ambassador in China and former governor of Iowa, the largest agricultural product exporter to China, stated that China was causing harm to American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in the Sunday edition column of Des Moines Register, "enforces pressure by publishing an advertisement containing propaganda in our independent press."
"For the spread of propaganda, China's government uses the road for the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and independence of the press, placing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"In contrast, in street schedules here in Beijing, you will find only individual voices by dissenting, and here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people actually think about the direction of the development of the Chinese economy, which is a concern, of which it can be concluded that China's media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respected Chinese publications has offered to publish" his article, but did not call it what it was.
Analytics warn that a failure with Cavano Republicans is setting up against themselves female voters before intermediate elections
Since many well-known Republicans support and protect the candidate for the Supreme Court Justice Bretta Cawano after he has been charged with sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may cause an undesirable reaction prior to future interim elections, especially in women.
Around this situation there are passions, and most Republicans publicly claim they would like to move on to the vote.
Such things then can't just play back," said The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Riger, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University.
Riger expressed doubt that the FBI's investigation, on which, at the last minute, Senator Jeff Flake, a republician from Arizona, would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
As reported in Washington, D.C, Chief Advisor and Regiment of the Progressive MoveOn Group (Ruther) Katrina Jean-Perrier on Friday said, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or in November."
According to Mick's information, on Friday morning, protesters sang "Listista approaching!" during the demonstration at the Legal Committee, when Republicans decided to move on to the approval of Kavano's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
In an interview with Stew Rotenberg's news website, an out-of-part political reviewer said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"This is what they're saying right now, and it's true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in 18–29 women's voters, from the suburbs that have not yet been defined and often do not vote if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford gave testimony due to the charges of the candidate for the Supreme Court's office in sexual crime, analysts predicted a negative reaction of voters if Republicans insisted on approval.
As reported by NBC News earlier this week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele stated, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As noted in an interview with the news channel, the director of the United States (U.S. ironies) (the groups that help in the pre-election campaign to Democrats) Guy Cecil, "is not really in the vote of the committee, the final vote, or the fact that Cavano found himself on the dock of the defendants, but in how they reacted to this situation and how they acted further."
However, the minds of Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Cavano split, a little bit more support has Ford.
According to a new poll by YouGov 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford's testimony, at the same time the testimony of Kawano believes or believes more than 35% of those interviewed.
In addition, 38% of those polled noted that they believed that Cavano was giving or most likely giving false testimony, while 30% of those polled said the same to Ford.
According to The Guardian, after Flake's insistence, the FBI conducts a check on the charges made by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Ford testified under the Virgin Committee's oath of how Cavano attacked her while in a state of alcohol abuse when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that the Supreme Court Justice candidate showed her his genitals at the party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Internet discoverer plans to launch a "new Internet" to create a Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global Internet, launches a new startup to create a Facebook, Amazon, and Google competition.
The latest design of technology legend, the Inrupt, is involved in developing an open source platform, Solid, whose idea belongs to Berners Li.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store the data and whom to give access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about a startup. –
It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create a "persunal online data storage" or POD.
It can store contact lists, lists of current affairs, calendar, audio library, and other tools for personal use and work.
It's like using Google Drive at the same time, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser.
The unique feature of this personal online data store is that it is fully consistent with the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the spread of personal opportunities through data."
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to activate resources, processes, and skills so that the Solid platform becomes available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired in IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not conducting talks with Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete replacement when all their business models are experiencing profound changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication at Medium Burners-Lee, he wrote that an Inrupt company mission – "to secure commercial energy and ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of a new network created on the Solid platform base."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Web Consorciate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months Berners-Lee – an influential figure in debate over network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt Burners-Lee, he remained the founder and director of the Conservative of the World Web, The Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of the Representative of the Church of the Order of Victoria in the First World War
The only representative of the Church of England to have received the Order of Victoria for participation in the fighting during World War I, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded a award for participating in the attack under Belsandez and Leokur on 29 September 1918.
However, he died of a sniper bullet four days later and never learned that he had received Britain's highest military award.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called "extraordinaryly symbolic" that the discovery of memorial stone took place just 100 years after his grandfather performed an feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Vann transferred his battalion across the Saint-Katen channel "with a very dense fog and under dense fire field guns and machine guns."
Later, he hurried to the fire section and with "a desperate courage" leading the race forward, one burst into the field cannon and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – a little more than a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather did what he himself would never be able to repeat and what deserves respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann placed the crown after the parade under the Brentwood Group Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very proud of taking part in this parade" and added that "the display of the real hero shows him the honor that so many people show him."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, and instead they were shown the Pepp Spark.
Imagine that you are not sleeping all night just to watch the full event of the Bellator 206 tournament, and you are denied the opportunity to review the main event.
In the tournament posters held in San Jose, 13 fights were listed, including six main program matches broadcast live at night in Britain on 5 channel.
At 6 a.m., just before Hegard Musasi and Rory Macdonald prepared to come together in the match, the British television viewers were frozen with wonder when a Peppa pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the battle.
Some viewers were not thrilled because they did not sleep until the morning, waiting for a fight.
One fan wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon appeared to him "some unfortunate joke."
"In accordance with the ruling of the content government broadcast at 6 a.m., it was inadequate, so they had to release a baby transfer," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of marketing and relations with the Bellator public when asked about television, "
"Pepa Spark," yes."
The president of the company Bellator Scott Coker promised to work on the broadcasts schedule so that viewers in Britain would be present in the future.
"I think if we talk about the broadcast, we'll be able to do it," Kower said.
"But now it's Sunday, 6th morning, and we can't do anything until we have a Sunday, and they have a Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was off, we received a lot of messages that we answered, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turned out that this was inconsequential to government regulations.
I can promise you no more such things will happen.
We're going to reduce the tournament to five battles instead of six, as usual, as we're trying to send the signal to fans, but we've put these attempts aside.
A really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daley tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not everyone looks like him," until he went to high school.
As he participated in the transfer of Desert Island Discs (Districts of a deserted island) on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he spoke openly about gay rights to give a "hope" to others.
He also stated that his fatherhood had reduced his anxiety about winning the Olympics.
The bear, who has long held this program, Kirsty Young, went to hospital for several months.
Coming as a couple for the first Lavern program, Daly stated that he felt worse than others when he was a child, because "the society didn't accept when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the sense of less value and the difference was exactly what gave me strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that something was "worth" so that he wouldn't disappoint all those who eventually learned his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic receiver became a famous LBGT community rights wrestler and took advantage of the emergence of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to challenge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke openly about his views because he felt happy to live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
The three-time World Championship admitted that feeling for a man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise to him.
The Daily took with Oscar's award winner, senior of 20 years, last year, however, he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so many things at such a young age" (at the first Olympics he performed at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone his own age who would also survive similar failures and falls.
In June, a son named Robert Ray Black Daley appeared in the couple, and since then, according to Daly, his "enlightenment" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd only think about having gold," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father couldn't accept the thought of the end and before he died asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't sit in the front row because you're not going to be around anymore," the Daily said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daly took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of my fellow countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that," said the Daily.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud (Gord) in the performance of Heather Smoll – which resonated with him while preparing for the Olympics and still summons ants.
The Desert Island Discs program is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 according to English summer time.
On Saturday, from the game of the Ryder Cup, Mikelson was taken out, which was not in shape
American Phil Mikelson will set up a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup tournament, however he should restore the form so that this event will not become unhappy for him.
Mikelson, who is in the record 12th time involved in a tournament that takes place once for two years, has led Captain Jim Fowrick out of the game while holding forballs and forks.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained in the side, hoping to master emotions.
Since Mikelson was not famous for the fitting blows even while on the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete did not quite fit for the complex field of the Le Golf National golf, where the falsity usually punishes for wandering strikes.
And if the field itself is not so much an obstacle, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mikelson will have to meet the Open Championship champion and the master of Francesco Molinari's exact impact, who, in a pair with new Tommy Fleetwood, won all his games this week.
If Americans who fall back three points after 12 single matches start well, Mikelson's match can be decisive.
Furrick expressed confidence in his athlete, and he certainly had nothing to add besides that.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on his back, embraced me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furrick.
"He doesn't question his powers.
Mikelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, which has done so much for the teams in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't think he'd play two games.
I projected more matches, but it did, and so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, on the field, like anyone else."
If Mikelson comes out on Saturday, he'll beat Nick Faldo's record, which played the largest number of games in the Ryder Cup.
On this he may complete his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which never matched his individual achievements.
In Mikelson's account, 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 night results, however Fulrick said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, bity, witty, likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's cool to have in the team," said Furrick.
"I think younger players have had a good time coming to him as well as this week, and it was interesting to see that.
He's more than just a player."
Captain of the European Team Thomas Bjorn knows that a great break doesn't solve anything
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a palpable break in front of single matches the last day of the Ryder Cup does not yet guarantee the win.
Dutchin debuted in 1997 in a match on Walderram Club field, where a team led by Sev Ballesteros was ahead of the Americans for five points, but won the match with a minor break with the result of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the Walderram field match; a big break in Brooklin, where we lost, and in the Walderram field where we had the best to win," said Bjorn after watching the 2018 winning games with a result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National Stadium, followed by a break of 10.6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing is yet decided.
We have to play with the maximum retirement tomorrow.
To go to the fields and do whatever is necessary.
The game will only be over after the result appears on the tablo.
We have the goal – to win this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're pretty much aware of who's against us – the world's best players."
Contented with his players' performance in a complex field, Bjorn added, "I'll never run ahead.
Tomorrow, everything can come together in a different way.
Tomorrow, we have individual matches waiting for us, and that's something else.
It's great to play the field with your partner when things go well, but it's when you stand there alone, and you can check that you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how players need to be configured to perform tomorrow: at the limits of their capabilities.
You leave your partner with no support and now he also has to show what he can do."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furrick expects his partners to have a better one-on-one game, with the exception of Jordan Spayta and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
To Furica's very last day, fate returned to different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created the Chudo in Medina.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, team captain of 1999, organized players before the final day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves on to someone else's side, the players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We properly placed the players in the team, as if we were going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas is commissioned to try to lead a counterpost in top-mat against Rory McGilroy, then on the first half of the list of Europeans' teams, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter.
"There are these partners and in that order I choose because I want to evenly distribute the effort throughout the game," so I commented Bjorn my choice of players on individual games.
The introduction of a new German battleship was delayed again
Germany's most modern navy frigate was to be put into effect in 2014 instead of the old-fashioned warships of the Cold War, however, according to local media information, it would not happen until at least the following year due to faulty systems and a steep increase in spending.
According to Die Zeit newspaper, obtained from a spokesman for the military department, entering the Ranland-Paltz ship, the main vessel of the state-Wertemberg series's most modern-class frigates, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
This vessel was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the shipment have damaged the implementation of the ambit project.
The four ships of the "Baden-Würtemberg" class, which the navy was ordered in 2007, are to replace the obsolete Bremen class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-air and counter-creative rockets, as well as some technology to reduce visibility, particularly radiolomatic, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical security. New frigates are expected to not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
However, Die Zeit journalists warn that due to constant delays over modern warships that were to reinforce Germany's military power in the sea, at the time of introduction, they will also grow old.
A long-term F125 frigate was put in the headlines of newspapers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to bring the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm + Vosss in Hamburg.
This is the first case of a military ship's return to the shipbuilding company after the shipment.
There are few known reasons for the return, but German media mentioned significant "program and equipment effects," which made the warship unfit for military operations.
The failures of software are of particular importance, since the Baden-Würtemberg-class crew consists of about 120 sailors – it is only half the number of military men who served on the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it has been found to have considerable excess weight, making it more difficult to exploit and limiting opportunities for further modernization.
It is believed that the Rangeland Pfaltz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
Expected 2.2 billion euros turned into colossal 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion U.S.).
Problems with getting new frigates gained special importance in light of recent warnings of the decline of the German Navy.
At the beginning of the year, he was commissioned by Bundestagu on the armed forces of Hans-Peter Barthels reported that the country's Navy had "a vast amount of ships fit to perform combat tasks."
The official stated that the situation had deteriorated rapidly over a period of time, as the old ships were out of operation and the new ones were not coming.
He expressed deep regret over the fact that none of the Baden-Würtemberg-class frigates were able to complete the navy.
National Pass will observe bat's secret life
A new study, conducted in the landland area in the Scottish Highlands, aims to determine how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals to take action in the future.
In the Invery Gardens in Wester-Rosy, scientists of the National Road Scotland will observe species such as the non-topy dwarf and the non-topy of the pygmei, as well as the ears of a conventional and water night.
Special registerers will be placed in strategic locations in the land area to monitor bat behavior during the season.
The staff and volunteers of the National Road of Scotland will also perform mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and affiliation of bat screams.
It is then planned to develop a detailed animal habitat map and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a Nature Protection Advisory in the National Route of Scotland, hopes that research results will help determine which areas of residence are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help assess the effectiveness of environmental care measures (e.g., the formation of meadows) and determine the optimal methods of conservation for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bat populations have greatly declined in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by active construction and expansion of areas that rob them of nesting sites.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, sticky paper for flies, chemical processing of building materials, and home cats attacks.
Bats are not actually blind.
Through night hunting, however, the ears are more effective in helping them catch prey than the eyes.
They use sophisticated sonar techniques to detect insects and obstacles to flight trajectory.
In the National Route of Scotland, which cares for over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the entire country, the problems of bats are taken very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland for bats, and it is located in the Trive site in the Damfris-end-Galloway area, and it has found a shelter of eight out of ten species of bats living in Scotland.
David Thompson, the city manager, states that this is an ideal place for them.
"On the site of Trive, excellent conditions for bats," he assures.
"There are old buildings, many giant trees, and other favorable living conditions here.
But we still need to learn a lot about bats, because of the research we do here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to do for prosperity."
He insists that it is very important to check the area for bats before doing any technical work, since the unwitting destruction of one nesting site for the breeding of the young can kill up to 400 females with infants, which is likely to result in the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture, or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Center, called for the public to join the organization's efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot more to learn about our bats, and we still haven't discovered the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape and his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German edition
Krishtian Ronaldu called the charges of rape "indicted" and stated that people were "trying to attract attention to themselves," using his name.
His lawyers are willing to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published suspicion information.
American Catherine Majorga accused a forward of the Portugal and the Juventus football club in rape, which took place in 2009 in the hotel room in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel reported on Friday, Ronalda appears to have paid her $35,000 for silence.
A few hours after the charges of 33-year-old Ronaldo had been made, he turned to 142 million of his fans in video broadcasting in Instagram, calling appropriate messages "off."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's indictment is a slander," such a statement was made on the camera by the five-time Lord of the Golden Ball.
"They want to attract attention to themselves using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to live on me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine," added a footballer, smiling.
According to Reuters news agency, Rónald's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the published charges they have called "unprecedented reports of private life's suspicions."
A lawyer, Christian Sherz, stated that a footballer would require compensation for "moral damage in the size that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most severe cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the specified incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino Hotel issue in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the Ronaldu and Majorga nightclub, he returned to the player's number, where he allegedly attacked her anally, and was transferred to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident described, Ronaldo fell to her knees and said he was "99 percent good guy", which he raised "one percent."
As noted in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but by mutual consent.
The Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to an out-of-law settlement, because she was "in pain of revenge" and was alerted to "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel a previous deal because she continues to suffer because of an incident that she said had a seat.
At the time of the incident noted, Ronalda was preparing to move to FC Real Madrid from the FC Manchester United, this summer he became a player in the Italian football grant, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will "longly regret" the loss of automakers
Great Britain will "longly regret" if it loses the status of world leader in auto production after Brexit, warns Minister Greg Clark's economy.
He added that he was thrilled by the statement by Toyota UK representatives who informed BBC journalists that in the case of the release of Britain from the EU without agreement, the company would be forced to suspend the production and work of its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," assures Minister Clark.
A Japanese automaker stated that the effects of delays on the border in case of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The launch in Bernaston, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, released some 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"To my view, if Britain Exegets ES at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about the impact of Britain's exit from the EU without an agreement on international trade.
For example, in the BMW company, it said that the Mini model production factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main fears of automakers are that Brexit without agreement may cause risks for supply chains.
The Toyota production line operates in operational delivery mode for details and materials according to needs – details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars made for order.
If Britain leaves the EU with no agreement on 29 March, the border may be blocked in supplies of detail, leading to delays and lack of materials.
As noted in the company, there are no more details on Toyota than one day, so production will have to be stopped.
Greg Clark noted that in terms of organizing relations with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), "there is specifically a scheme to avoid problems on the border."
"We need an agreement, we need to make an optimal deal that I think will enable not only to succeed at the current moment but also to take advantage of the prospects that arose," he said during the Today program on BBC Radio radio station 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives, as well as other auto manufacturers, we need to make sure that the highly effective supply chain is formed."
In the company, Toyota was unable to report how production would be stopped for long but in the long term, it is expected that increasing costs would reduce the value of the factory and, as a result, cause jobs to decrease.
Peter Tsalris, chairman of the Unite Professional Society in a factory in Bernaston, which worked here for 24 years, reported that other participants were extremely concerned, "I can say from experience that cut-out jobs do not recover."
A government spokesman noted, "We have developed an accurate and reliable plan to form our future relations with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting can postpone, mark in the White House
According to White House representatives on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Trump with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "put off for another week" while the debate is under discussion over the removal of Brettt Cawano's candidate's candidacy as Supreme Court judge.
Rosenstein controls the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's intervention in elections, relationships between Trump and Russia's assistants, and potential interference with justice from the president.
For a few months, in Washington, D.C., there is a discussion of the possibility of the release of the deputy attorney general, which will put Mueller's independence at risk.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about using microphones to record conversation with Trump and the possibility of an early end to president's powers for 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House in the background of reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was appointed Thursday.
Trump stated that he would "not wish" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence over time with the Senate Legal Committee meeting, on which to testify to Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Bleezi Ford.
On Friday, Trump arranged to conduct a weekly FBI investigation on charges against Cavano, which further repealed the vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday television show.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied, "The meeting's date is not due, maybe it will happen this week, and I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I'm constantly making sure the press has the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not conduct briefings for media in the White House since September 10.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the time-ending of the briefings was not related to the dislike of "public play" on the part of television reporters, although she added, "Don't mind that they play the public."
She then assumed that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
"President gives answers to questions more often than any president to him," she said, adding without referring to the source, "Stitty talks for herself."
Sanders noted that briefings would still be held, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask a question to the U.S. president, it's better than talking to me."
We've been trying to talk to the press a lot, and it should have been particularly evident over the past few weeks, the ability to talk to the President of the United States is not worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings, or press conferences for the participation of high-end guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York City this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, acting in front of journalists disfigured and sometimes weird.
The Scottish State Health Secretary of State requested a letter to EU staff due to concerns over Brexit
The State Health Secretary of State requested a letter to citizens of other EU countries who work at the National Health Service of Scotland to express appreciation for their work and ask for it to continue after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent a letter in less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already taken on the commitment to cover the cost of applications to receive the status of permanent carrier for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman noted: "During the summer, there were negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of getting out.
But the UK government increases preparations for a possible solution without a deal.
I know this period can be very disturbing to you.
That's why I would like to stress again how I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Companions from all over the European Union and countries outside of it share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving health services in favour of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland – your home, we really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercrombie underwent surgery after head injury
The team's quarterback of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Ebercrombie, underwent a term surgery after receiving head injuries in the Sunday match against Wanderballt Comodores, which his team lost at 31:27.
The head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He went to the sideline where he was bad," Reed said.
Behind the side line, coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it to further examination on the burrows.
Tennessee State Tigers official representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV Channel (Nasville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie operated at the University of Wanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "as long as there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury." In the Tennessee State Tigers team, they try to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-year-old, spent his first season in Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He performed five ball intercepts on Sunday before getting out of the game, thus in the season he scored 18 interceptions.

In the Ministry of Finance, hopes are to attract an additional $120 million a year to help the homeless
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in Britain will pay more customs, and additional funds will be spent helping the homeless.
This step can be considered as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters with promises of more affordable housing aimed at highly paid workers.
The promotion of the customs will apply to the physical and legal people who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the government will direct additional funds to help those who are forced to spend the night under the open sky.
An additional tribute, which includes a two - year - old promotion to a second home and residence, may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, hopes are to attract an additional $120 million a year.
According to specialists, 13% of the new real estate built in London is owned by foreign citizens, leading to higher prices and difficulty with the task of those who only dream of their own housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country, particularly the capital, are out of control because large numbers of foreign buyers live most of the time outside the country.
A new plan of action appeared just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lowering of the state customs to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by purchasing land without further use of it, and he urged Teresa May to give up quotas for affordable real estate to correct "agnominable situation in the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of important real estate reforms, particularly the control of rent and the impoverishment of eviction without sound grounds.
He also offers to expand the authority of local councils in the construction of new housing.
Theresa May said, "Last year I promised to devote my premiere to restoring the British dream – for every new generation of life must be better.
It needs change in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their own future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own housing has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open skies is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "For the most part, I seek to be the head coach of the collecting Scotland"
The head coach of the FC Sanderland, Jack Ross, claims that "over everything" will ever lead Scotland's collection.
A 42-year-old Scotsman set out to restore the club from the north-east of the country, which is now third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to Stedium of Lyth this summer, returning last season FC St-Mirren to the Scottish Premier League.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to second in Scotland, but it's all over," Ross told the Sportssound program on the BBC Scotland radio station.
"When I was a little boy, my father and I often watched the game of a team of Scotland at the Hampshire Park Stadium, which has always attracted me.
The only hope for me remains to succeed as the club's head coach."
Ross's predecessors at the Sanderland FC, in particular, were Dick Advoct, David Meis, Sam Ellardas, Martin O'Nill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poett, and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach FC "Alloa Attletik" claims that he did not feel the excitement of moving to a large club following such authoritative names, having previously rejected proposals from the Barnsley FC and Ipswich Town.
"At the current stage, I will believe I have succeeded if the club returns to Premier League.
Due to its structure and material-tech provision, this club no doubt corresponds to the Premier League level," he remarked.
"It will be a challenge, but the other outcome I will hardly consider successful."
Ross has only been building a coaching career for three years, and he worked as a second coach at FC Dambarton and also spent 15 months at the FC Harts Training Center.
He then helped Alloa to hatch after FC reached the third division, and in the next season with St. Irene went the way from the flight stage to winning the first division title.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his game career in FC "Claid", "Hartplel," "Folkerk," "St-Mirren" and "Hamilton Academy".
"I found myself at a crossroads," he recalls, speaking of moving to FC Alloa.
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more suitable for me than playing.
That sounds strange because I was successful, a good job at it and achieved some height.
But playing is very difficult.
There are many challenges to face every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and stress, but as the head coach, I feel at my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt as comfortable in my entire adult life as after choosing this profession."

Research: 17:30 Sunday – The perfect time for a beer cup
The summer heat helped to increase the British pubs that survive not the best of times but increased the pressure on the restaurant network.
According to sales calculations in pubs and bars in July, it increased by 2.7%, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8%.
The author of Peter Martin of the CGA organization, which consults on business development, noted: "The dates of solar weather and more durable than expected, England's involvement in the World Cup, July passed by the same scheme as the previous month when the pabbs were grown by 2.8%, and the restaurant was worse.
The June drop by 1.8% in July increased.
Pabes and bars focused on drinks, while they have the best rates – the growth in their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pabes with food were also affected by the heat but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that only drinking is of interest to visitors.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of drinks per month increased by 6.6%, with food sales reducing by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst of the Department on Legislative and Hotel Business at RSM, remarked, "We have seen a positive trend since late April.
Weather and major social or sports events remain major factors affecting sales in the inner market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to lose profits, with an annual drop in sales by 4.8% causing particular concern over the need to reduce spending.
The long hot summer did not come at the best time for food-feeding facilities; we'll see if the milder temperature we've observed in August will give them such a needed rest."
The general increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new institutions, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing out of the market for new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker's Gale indicator of sales in the pub, bars and restaurants of Britain is a reflection of the collected and analysed production rates of 47 working groups whose aggregate freight is more than $9 billion. This is the generally accepted industry standard.
1 in 5 children has a hidden social network account from their parents
As evidenced by the research, 1 in 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, has a hidden account from their parents and teachers on social networking
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increasing number of fake pages in Instagram
This news has increased concern about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "general account" that shows parents
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years old, creates an account on social media that hides from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increasing number of fake pages in Instagram – a social network to exchange photos.
This news has increased concern about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean "base" account that shows parents as well as one or more private ones.
The mother, who happened to come across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the call "sworse me up."
A study conducted by Digitalhood UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) organizations in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles in social networks. Half of these children admitted that an additional account is secret.
The head of the HMC association Mike Buchanan noted, "We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel like creating an online space in which parents and teachers will not be able to find them."
Ailed Doyle will become the "representative of the interests of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Council
Ailed Doyle is elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an independent director during the annual general board of government members.
Doyle is Scotland's most prominent athleticist, the head of the Yen Beatty Council has called this step a fine opportunity for those who lead the sports movement to take advantage of its extensive experience acquired internationally for the past decade.
"Ailed uses great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Great Britain and the world, and we are convinced that by involving her to the board, the athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit" – assured Beatty.
Doyle noted, "With inspiration I'm giving as a representative of the interests of athletes, and I hope I can really benefit from and promote sports in Scotland."
American, four-time Olympic champion who won the run at 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 games in Atlanta, and now – a sports columnist for BBC, lost the opportunity to walk through a transit Ichmithic attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much.
With incredible effort, I was able to recover completely, and I learned to walk again, and today I am practicing dynamic exercises!
Thank you for the words of support!"
In a milk-sucker commercial, women were compared to cows – Internet users' thoughts split
The milk-pulling manufacturer has faced the repeated response of Internet users to a commercial in which young mothers are compared to effective cows.
On the recognition of the release of a product called "the first in the world of a quiet, domestic milk-suctor", Elvie's technological consumer goods company released an ad in a humorous music video style to demonstrate the freedom that is provided to mothers by a new suctioner.
The four real mothers dance in a filled hay-filled cower under the song containing these words, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail" and "You see yourself, it's not a bath, it's my breasts."
The chorus goes on to sing, "Smooth, suck to feed the children, suck, suck up the milk."
However, a commercial commercial, published on Facebook's page, caused a heated discussion online.
The video has gained 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the response of Internet users has proved to be ambiguous, and many have noted that the advertising has underestimated the "horrible organization" of the production of milk in industry.
"Not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their children are taken away from them a few days after birth," one of the users wrote.
Elvie's milk-sniffer can easily be hidden in a brastball for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "I realized it was traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why don't you engage them to advertise milk-snake for women who need to feed their babies?"
Another one added, "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users have defended the commercials, and one of the women's videos has been "very fun."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
It would be unrealistic to acquire such a thing if it was still breast - feeding.
I felt really like a cow when I was sucking my milk.
Advertising was a bit crazy, but I didn’t look into it for hidden meaning.
A great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "The fungal commercial focused on the moms, who suck out the milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at covering the benefits and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show milk suctions hidden in their ballots.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel that they are cows.
However, Elvie's suction works perfectly quietly, without wires or tubes, and easily conceals in a soup for feeding, which allows women to move, hold children, and even walk out on the street.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the Mother advertising agency, commented on the situation: "Elvie's suction so revolutionary a product it required a vivid and provocative representation.
Having drawn a parallel between women who heal milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breast-feeding, in an exciting and interesting way by demonstrating an incredible sense of freedom that will bring a new suction.
Elvie's suction is not first introduced into news headlines.
As part of the Week of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product while displaying clothing from the modeler Martha Jakubska.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of delayed migrant children increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively constant, partly because a rigid rhetoric and policy on the part of the Trump administration made it difficult to place children in caretakers.
Traditionally in most cases, caregivers themselves performed immigrants without documents, now they are afraid to put their own opportunity to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to give fingerprints and that these data would be transferred to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking Bureau of Immigration and Custom Control, testified to Congress that the Bureau staff had arrested dozens of people who had filed applications for caring for minors with no escort.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal past.
"Nearly 80% of the people who are caregivers or members of their households are illegal in the country.
So we continue to pursue these individuals," Mr. Albens noted.
According to asylum workers to view children's cases more quickly, officials have established new rules that require some of the children to appear before the court within a month of detention, not 60 days later, as it used to be.
Many of them will be able to use video conferences and not come to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who, under the court's decision, do not have the right to obtain asylum will be quickly deported.
According to asylum workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will feel anxious or depressed, which can result in outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Legislatives claim that these problems are increasing in institutions of larger size, such as Tornillo, where it is harder to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving the children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or to say good - bye to our friends, we are at risk of strengthening the injury that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S., France, and Turkey to immediately withdraw troops
In addition, in front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Valid al-Muall called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for eight years.
Moal, who also works as the deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were in the Syrian land illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so "representing them will be appropriate."
"They must leave immediately and not put conditions," he stated at the assembly.
Muhammad insisted that "war with terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He stated that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has placed about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are speaking against President Bahara al-Assad.
In the war - torn country of France, more than 1,000 soldiers were sent.
As for the refugees, Moal assured that the country had created proper conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of "probing baseless fears" that prevented the refugees from returning.
"We have called for international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to people coming back" – he said.
"We see efforts to fly purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not provide Syria with assistance in restoring the country until a political agreement is made between Asad and an opposition to the end of the war.
The UN Diplomats will report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey about the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major regiment of the rebels, created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian and cultural agreement, three million people have been prevented from being attacked by the Syrian forces supported by Russia, to a province where three million people live.
However, Moal stressed that the deal has "tick terms," and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against Jahidists, including militants associated with Al-Qaeda Front en-Nosra, who "will be destroyed."
Emissaryser of the United Nations Staffan de City hopes soon to gather the first meetings of the new committee, made up of representatives of government and opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for the elections.
Moal set out the terms for participation of the Syrian government on the committee, stating that his work should be limited by "a review of articles of a valid constitution," and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Be Re-elected
According to this logic, Trump may be reelected in 2020, if many liberal viewers are likely to be expected, he will not constitute a posthumously after scandal and impeachment.
No doubt that would be "the most dramatic conclusion of the presidency over the whole time"!
At present, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of prime-time viewers has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel ended up at the top of a rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news was discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our comprehension," said Neil Ber, executive producer of the drama "Last candidate" on the ABC channel about a state secretary who becomes president after a devastating attack on Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced human writer and author of the book, "Lice funny moments: as well as a few strict truths about penetration into the club of Hollywood men" offers another theory.
She recalled a trip to Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's making me laugh," he said.
Chaos is having fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington stories are able to determine the future of Row's case against Wade, the possibility of the reunion of immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
The separation is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it is not to be said that you are only trying to remain informed citizens when you spend six hours watching a group of experts discuss using Bob Woodward "well-known" sources for his book "Strach," a jacket by Paul Manafort of the skin of the ostrich for $15,000 (""" a clothing for the arrogant" – so wrote in The Washington Post, and the results of the shocking descriptions of Mr Trump's anatomy published by Scormie Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The sense of reality show is partly due to the fact that you are fed something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, the principal executive director of Weelhouse Entertainment and the author of the television series "The Rockbard Star", about the rotations in the cast and daily story twists in the "Tramp" show (Conflict with NFL, support of Kim Chen Inn).
If you allow yourself to miss one episode, you can be hopelessly behind.
When I was able to meet Mr. Flies in his home on the north coast of Kauai Island this week, there was a warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get rid of the TV – not when Brett Cavano stood before the Senate Legal Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on a hair.
"I remember we were creating all those crazy shows of our time, and people were saying that this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flies told me.
"I took it as a joke, but it seems they were right."

External donations of funds into the worst intermediate elections in Congress
Not surprisingly, additional cash donations are directed in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, as through a review of the boundaries of the constituency of the two current Congressmen are competing for one chair.
In the struggle for this suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have been recently changed, a Democrat comes in, a member of the Conor Lamb House of Representatives, who won a victory in another district in the additional elections last spring.
Lamb confronts another valid congressman, Republican Keith Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were re-made after, in January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court passed a decision that the old borders of the districts were defined in favor of the Republicans in spite of the constitution.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused fierce opposition between the financial units of the major parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee from the election to Congress (DCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's name became very well known in Pennsylvania after winning with a minimal advantage in the 18th district during the additional elections in Congress in March, which used widespread public attention.
President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in this county.
Political experts have given minor advantage to Democrats.
In the United States, the opportunity to punish El Salvador for supporting China was considered, but changed
The Diplomats reminded the faint resistance from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, who previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Pana Juan Carlos Varela, formerly Trump also had a hotel in Panama until partners discovered there personnel hired by Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department decided to revoke U.S. diplomatic missions executives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "last-last-time decisions on the ignorance of Taiwan," said the U.S. Department's press Secretary of Gezer Neuert in the early part of this month.
But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million American aid in 2017, particularly in drug control, as well as in social and economic development support.
Proposed fines, which provided a reduction in financial aid and the purpose restrictions on the visa's recovery, would be painful to this country of Central America with its high unemployment and killing rate.
According to internal councils, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed the conference at a high level dedicated to security and economic prosperity.
But by mid-September, senior officials of the administration had shown that they wanted the conference to take place, in fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador had ceased.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is now planning to perform at a conference appointed in mid-October, in recognition of what the administration considers this event to be very important.
At this, three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic because there were no new hard reports or penalties from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's representative in the White House refused to comment on the details of internal discussions reported by three American officials, two of whom are diplomats, on the terms of anonymity.
The information they provided confirmed by a side analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke on the terms of anonymity.
Study the History
The following unpleasantness may be the report by special prosecutor Robert Muller about possible violations of law on Trump's side, strong confirmation of what can be found in the public information available now.
As reported, as part of his investigation, Muller checks the possible relationship between Trump campaign and attack on our voting system from Russia.
If the influence in Congress passes into other hands, Trump will have to report to the congressionals as well as to the voters and eventually to the single-partys.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
We're all on both sides of the Atlantic to make a choice that will determine the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to launch a coup against Hitler if only the West began to oppose him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such turning points, and the uncontrolled movement of democracy accelerates or slows down.
There are a few of these fractured moments waiting for the Americans.
What will we do if Trump frees deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein – the man on whom Mr. Mueller's destiny depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble before this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to secretly record conversations with the president and shared reasoning on the subject of Trump's failure of office.
Rosenstein called information in The Times inaccuracy.
"How will we respond if an investigation in the case against Bretta Cavano, which recently started by the FBI, is not sufficient to be thorough or honest, or if Cavano candidacy for office in the Supreme Court is approved despite compelling accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, will we in the midterm vote for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, there will be evil times for democracy.
But I believe we will not, through the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slavic Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my Spanish house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me out to light Saturday candles on a youth table.
With that legacy, can I not look with optimism into the future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistically waits to meet Vienna's "Rapid"
The Rangers adopts "Rapid" (Avile) on Thursday. After an impressive night in Spain in a game with the Villarreal at the beginning of this month, the victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with good chances of exiting from the Group G League of Europe.
Because of knee injury, half-breeder Graham Dorrans was able to play for the first time in the season for his team only in a match with "Willarreal" that ended with a score of 2:2. However, he believes that FC Rangers can use this result as a tram to achieve more.
"This was a good result for us because "Williarral" – a strong team," – noted a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with the hope of getting at least something and winning one point.
Maybe at the end of the match, we could go forward, but in general, a draw is probably a fair result.
In the first taim, the opponent was better, but after a break we corrected the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday, there will be another important opposition to the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it won't be easy, our future opponents have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on support for fans, and I'm sure we can give a fight and get a positive outcome.
The past year was certainly difficult, starting with my injuries and ending changes in the club itself, but now the situation is normal.
We have a great warehouse, and all the guys are happy.
I hope we can go on, leave behind the past season and succeed."
Women lose sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Although poll participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize self-care, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people involved in the study of the Nationwood were said to have talked to their husband or wife about the value of long-term care.
Only 10% of those polled talked about it with the children.
"People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they don't have to rush into talking about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalside Division on Life Insurance.
That's where you have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: your family will not be able to provide needed care unless you inform your wishes to relatives beforehand.
Consult your consultant and family to determine where and how to receive care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining value.
Include a financial consultant: he may recommend how to cover appropriate expenses.
The sources of funding for long-term care include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or a personal security at the expense of your own funds (as long as you have money).
Prepare legal documents carefully, enabling you to avoid legal drafting ahead of time.
Prepare a trust for your representative, who will control your medical care and ensure that experts comply with your wishes if you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, it is recommended that we form trust at the expense of funds.
Choose the trustee who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if your disability is involved.
Remember the minor details, imagine that one of your aging parents needs emergency medical care, so they take him to the hospital.

Prepare such a plan."
In Ilfracumi, a man fired a number of times from a pneumonia rifle.
The man fired a gun several times as he returned home from the party.
A 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfraum, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at 002:30 for British summer time, as "a coincidence."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not a threat to life, but police are searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reports government authorities, but the number of victims may increase.
Due to the release of communications facilities by officials who are involved in providing humanitarian aid, there is no information from Dongala Regentship, a area north of Pow, which is located near the epicenter of the 7.5-ball magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Let us give you a few basic facts about the island of Sulawesi, the city of Palu and the regentship of Dongala.
Palu – capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 according to the 2017.
When the tsunami earthquake occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regent that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast line in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
According to a 2017 report in the regency, the administrative region located at the bottom of the province is about 299,200 people.
Fishing and agriculture are major areas of the province's central Sulawesi economy, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nikel mining is also important in the province, but mostly focused in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian agency for reducing the effects of natural disasters over the past 100 years, Palu and Dongala have suffered several times from the tsunami.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed as a result of a tsunami in Dongala, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongala, and nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located in a seismisticly active Pacific fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
The following are a few of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: December 26 a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acheg, located in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which – in the province of Acheg.
2005: At the end of March in early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: magnitude 6.8 quake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, resulting in the death of about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 magnitude earthquake was recorded near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: magnitude 7.5 quake hit one of the Mentaway Islands located near Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, resulting in dozens of villages destroyed and about 300 people killed.
2016: A weak earthquake affected the Vijajai Regency in Acheg Province, causing destruction and panic due to people's having not yet forgotten the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami was gone, but more than 100 people were killed under the debris of the buildings.

Federal prosecutors require a rare death penalty for suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifollo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist in New York City, resulting in eight deaths – a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipl at the drive of a leased at Home Depot pickapa rode a bicycleway along the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began to knock down cyclists and pedestrians who were on his way.
According to a report on the intent to seek the execution given in the South District of New York to justify the death penalty, the defendants must prove Saipov's "involved" killed eight people and "immediately" caused serious bodily damage.
According to judicial materials, each of these charges involve the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Justice filed Saipout charges for 22 counts, including eight murder charges in order to seek out, which usually federal prosecutors file in cases involving organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors who described Saiplim's crime as "surprising, cruel, and deliberate," this attack is the result of "responsible planning and premeditated minding."
The victims, by Siefull Habibulalević Saipov, caused injuries, injured or killed, were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laor Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferrchi, Ernan Diego Mendoza, and Aichandro Damian Pagukko, as described in a report on purpose.
Five dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time a criminal case was violated in the South District of New York, which is punishable by a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty for murdering two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty led to a performance in New York City in 1953, a couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of a conspiracy to spy out the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court material, a native of Uzbekistan did not demonstrate a guilty conscience in the following days and months after the attack.
According to police officers, he told the investigator that he did not regret what he had done.
According to Saipov's indictment, he was inspired by the authorities to carry out video IMPlCs, which he watched on his phone.
Police report that he also asked for an IIV flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He did not find himself guilty of charges for 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipa, said they were "very disappointed" by this decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting guilt recognition and award life imprisonment without the possibility of release only reinforces the psychological injury of all those affected," Patton said.
The Saipe's defense side had also asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Parliament's MP from the Conservative Party believes that the FARAJA's best-JOYAL needs to be appointed responsible for negotiations with Brexit
Today, during the protests at the Conservative Party's congress, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilise the national army."
Former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that politicians should "hear the pressure" of the European Union because one of the MPs of the Tereza May Parliament has proposed his candidacy to negotiate with the EU.
A MP from the Conservative Party, Peter Bown, stated on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have come out," if Mr. Faraj had been the secretary of Brexit.
Respect for May's problems in trying to reconcile its deeply divided ranks has even more attracted the MPs from the Conservative Party, who oppose the exit, to join the special action of protest in the city against Brexit.
The premier tries to implement Chequirs' compromise plan, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not abandon attempts to negotiate with Bruce, despite the negative reaction, and will force the Eurosquents and Labours to choose between what it offers and the "house".
At a rally, Leave Mans Leave in Solihhal, Mr. Bowon said he wanted to "response from Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraj to step out of the shadow and take responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were responsible for it, we'd be out," he said.
Parliament's MP, Wellingborough, added, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequirs."
Speaking against the EU, he stated, "We have fought in world wars not to subject ourselves.
We want to pass our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bowon rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, the public opinion changed, "The idea that the British had changed their minds and did not want to get out is totally not true."
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit Adre Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters, "I'm just saying, "Premier minister, listen to people.
The Chequirs plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who are actually going down the street and fighting for the votes of the voters.
Please throw away Chequers and begin to listen."
In address to Teresa May, she added, "Premier ministers keep their position when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Faraj stated that politicians should "feel pressure on themselves" if they are going to give up the decision made on the 2016 referendum.
"Now this issue of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say they won't get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who plans to betray Brexit's idea, to feel the pressure.
We will mobilize the national army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, opponents went out to Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists were waving the Conservatories against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
Leiborist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives because after the opening of the conference, their party program created security problems.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies necessary for Canada-plus, a well-organised border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a full fart.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren plans "to think seriously" about bedding for presidential post
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the election in November, she would "think seriously about the president's betting on the president's post."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during the general assembly in western Massachusetts, a Democratic Party representative from Massachusetts spoke about his future.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, runs in November for a second term against Republican Party member Jeff Dil, who was co-head of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is it that is considered as a major candidacy that can be fought with Trump in 2020.
On Saturday the day was her 36th meeting with voters in the general meeting format since Trump entered office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the election at the president's post.
Warren replied that "the time for women to go to Washington and get the work done by the government, and for that to be the woman on his head."
The suspect was arrested in the shooting of basketball player "LU Tigers" Sims
In the Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, on Saturday, it was reported that a suspect in a basketball basketball player's "LSY Tigers" Wade Sims had been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Authority announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the east time.
On Friday, they published a video recording of shootings asking to help identify the person on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot at the campus of Sautern University on Friday morning.
"Wyd Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head and died as a result," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade frowned for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found at the scene of the crime, carrying weapons, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton County Police Administration.
Sims, who was 6 feet and 6 inches tall and who performed in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge, and played 32 games with 10 stars in the past season and averaged 17.4 minutes on the field, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds.
Grand Prixes of Russia: Lewis Hemilton reduced resignation in the struggle for the world champion's title after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the moment on Saturday, Waltri Bottas left behind Lewis Hemilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well with a post office and almost bypassed Hemilton, who tried to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to a pit stop first and left Hemilton on a track in the tail of the race that had to solve everything.
The Mercedes team pilot drove another round and went behind Fettel, but Hemilton was released into the leaders after a certain maneuver wheel to the wheel, resulting in a reluctant driver being reluctant to leave the inner space due to the risk that he was trapped, after having been able to run forward on a third turn as a result of a double maneuver.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferspen started from the back row of nets and remained in the seventh place until the end of the first circle.
He led most of the race, since he did not change the tires to quickly come to the finish and place Kimie Rykonen from the fourth place.
He eventually stopped at a pit stop at the 44th lap, but failed to increase his pace at the last eight, making Reikconen move fourth place.
"It's a tough day because Valtterie was teaching full on all weekends and exhibited grace when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an exceptional job to take first and second place," Hemilton said.
The Language of the Body Did Not Affect
On Saturday morning, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Finestein for her firm stand in not publishing the contents of Christine Blazy Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano in sexual violence.
During a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly address the testimony given by Ford to the Legal Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his opinion of the events in the Senate, which he said demonstrated the human "subdivision, the implacence, and the lyingness."
"The only thing that could have happened, and all the wonderful things that have been happening for the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see the evil people showing the mean, the disgusting and lying," he said.
"You look at the publications and the information told, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finestein, did you publish the information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the contents of the documents? – "What?
Oh, no.
I didn't say it."
Wait a minute.
We made a statement?...No, we haven't made a statement," he added, copying Senator's behavior.
In July, Finestane received a letter with a detailed statement of charges made by Ford against Cavano, and in early September his contents were announced, but Finestein denied that the leak of information had occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't advertise the information I got from her," said Finestine of the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break promises."
However, her denial seems to have displeased the president, who commented during the Saturday rally, "I'll tell you, her body language didn't strike at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone hold on to worse."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual violence, the president suggested that Democrats use charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by whatever necessary means.
You see the mean, the ferocity, they don't care who gets offended, through whom you have to go to gain power and control," – Mediaite quotes the president's words.
Elliot League: "Dandy Stars" – "Belfast Jaiants", 5:3
"Jaantis" player Patrick Duyer dropped two shabes in a match against "Dandy"
Dundee Stars was rehabilitated for a Friday defeat in the elite league from the Belfast Jayants, winning a 5-3-point game on Saturday.
"Jaantis" received an early advantage in two shabes thanks to Patrick Duyer and Francis Boville's throwers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney leveled the score in the home match and then Duyer again led the Jayants forward.
The Dundee player, François Bouhar, leveled the score, and two Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's goals secured their victory.
This is the third in the elite league season to defeat Adam Keef's team, which received a volley victory over Dundy with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season, three previous matches won the Jayants team.
The first pair, Duyer, dropped in the fourth minute (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFoll, and four minutes later, Boville, who received a chaiba from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After the intense first period at the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the owners of the field to the game, and on the sixteenth minute (15:16) Kouni, when he received a show from Matt Markwardt, leveled the score.
Duyer preferred "Jayants" before the first break, throwing his second shayba at the end of the first period.
The owners of the fields were regrouped, and Buhar at twenty-eightth minute (27:37) again leveled the score by dropping the shaib when his team was numerically overwhelming.
Thanks to Couni and Charles Corcoran Nielsen's efforts at the end of the second period, he first led Dundy forward and secured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Jayants team, which has already lost four of the last five games, will play an exit match against the Milton Keynes.
Avidaspecher died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid the earthquake
Aviadspecher in Indonesia declared a hero after he had helped fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
Over 800 people were killed and many missing after a severe earthquake that caused tsunamis on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong underground winds continue to kill this area, and many people are under flooding in the city of Plau.
However, to differ from his colleagues who had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Aung refused to leave his post at the dispatch tower, which was badly lofted, at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Pow.
He remained in place to make sure that Flight 6321 Batik Air airline, who was at the time on the runway, was safely up in the air.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was being destroyed.
He later died in the hospital.
A representative of Indonesian company of aeronavigacy services carrier Johannes Siraut said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Badikpapan to Kalimán, who is to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're very sorry to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of casualties may reach thousands because the country's natural disaster agency claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"The number of victims may grow because many bodies are still under debris and many of them cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugoroho's representative.
The 20 - foot - high [6 m] waves devastated the city of Palu, which would host mass burials on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver relief and food supplies.
Reese Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute an ambulance brings the body.
There's not enough clean water.
Minimarks are everywhere looted."
The chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but things can get a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Vido arrived in Pal on Sunday and said to the officers of the country, "I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia was affected by earthquakes on Lombok Island, resulting in over 550 deaths.
Aviactastroph in Micronesia: As stated in Air Niguini, after the plane fell into the lagoon, one man disappeared missing
The airline, which performed a plane crash in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one person has disappeared, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crews were safely evacuated from the aircraft that was sinking.
In Air Nigini, it was stated that one passenger could not be found on Saturday's status.
The airline reports that its representatives seek to find a husband and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane fell to water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and exact sequence of events are unknown.
In the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believe the aircraft has flown the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low above the ground.
"That's very good," Janes said.
Janes told him that he and others managed to get into emergency exits on a ton plane while on a belt in the water.
He told me that the stewardess were panicking and screaming, and that he had received a light head injury.
In the U.S. Navy, it was reported that sailors working near the dock upgrade also helped in a rescue operation, delivering people to shore using an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data in the last two decades, 111 people have died in plane crash related to PNG-related airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analytic restored the chronology of the night, in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution broke the case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rollett testified as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told the jury members how he used recordings from the mobile phone to recreate the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinn Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rollett, reported by The Clarion Ledger, said that he received data on location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers that night, when she died, contrary to his previous claims.
When the data showed his mobile phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Senford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Senford testified and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford pick that night, Senford said he was "brighter because my pick was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Telephone records indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Rollett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He has wiped her out of his life," Gale said.
The defense has to post its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be passed to the jury later that day.

The High Bred group of Bristol claims hip hop changed its nature – withdrew political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the leaks and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fuges and Common have recently witnessed the revival of this directly in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
In New York, the babysitter sued a couple for dismissal, receiving a "parasist" message
In New York City, the babysitter filed a couple for discrimination release after receiving an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was "another black."
The couple deny that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit with "fighting."
Linsie Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she saw that a new babysitter, Giselle Morris, who arrived on her first day in 2016, was a black woman.
"No, ONE TEMNOSHKIRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flacman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him twice, Miss Morris.
As reported by the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plakson-Flaxman felt "uncomplicated" and released Miss Morris, she said that their previous baby-sitter, who was an African-American, had been doing a poor job and that instead she expected a babysitter from the Philippines.
Miss Morris paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now suing a couple, hoping to receive compensation for the payment she would receive in six months of living in a marriage that she was initially hired, although she was not under contract, and was expected to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't need to do that," she said Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the charge that they were racists, the couple said that Morris ’ release was a wise decision because they feared they could not trust her after they were offended.
"My wife didn't mean to have sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Post her husband Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with a man who was rude, even if it wasn't deliberate?
Your baby?
NATION."
Comparing a "fighting lawsuit," Plasco said his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and "not yet done."
"Would you avenge anyone after that?
It's a bad thing," added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their conduct and logic.
According to a new letter, Padington publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book agreed to print, said of the letter, "It's hard to put herself in the seat of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's funny because we know of a huge success that won the Padington story."
Speaking of her father, who worked as a BBC operator before a little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, optimistic about his work being rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release at the same time felt "joy and sorrow" because his father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was rather a modest man and didn't like to boast," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child! for when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although they are not theirs, not our wins.
I think he was looking at Padington's success that way.
Although Padington – creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good-bye to her
After her daughter landed, she was taken to Louis Pasteur's 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"Nad regularly called, said everything was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Eden-Lapers.
"And then Over called me and said she would die within the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The drugs given to her to keep her heart beating gradually ceased to operate and came out of her body.
She died some time before the whole thing was shut down.
I was supposed to just sit and wait knowing what's going on at this time.
I couldn't push, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
It was supposed to be really holding itself together."
Finally, Mrs. Edwin-Laperuz, who was grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had experienced.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I dropped my head and couldn't hold back my tears.
This is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to have deep sympathy for Nadia.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
The two women who have been affected leave cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphris leave a postcard on the Welsh bridge with telephone numbers for which people can turn for support, as well as messages that they would pray for.
Miss Davis Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I feel every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Leedna, told her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
"All knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room lighter."
But he quit work before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11, found his brother's body after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll have consequences."
Miss Davis created postcards, "so people know that there are those they can address and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't lock yourself up – you have to talk."
Ms Humphres, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, who was 15 years old, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, that he was depressed or that sort of thing," she said.
"Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas day, he finally got discouraged, and when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She told me that his death was a huge injury to them, but they had to survive it, "It's been devastating.
Oh, well, I guess we should go to the family.
But we must continue to live on and fight."

Bretta Kawano's future hangs on a hair: FBI begins an investigation
"I thought if we could get what we asked – limited in time and character of investigation – we might have achieved a certain agreement – said on Saturday Mr. Flake and added that he was afraid that the committee was "enraged" against the groundless loss of allegiance to the political party.
Why did Mr. Cavano and his audience supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to time.
The interim elections will go through everything five weeks, November 6, if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously make their attempts to run their own man's election into the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators to support Mr. Cavano, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who worked as personal secretary to Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI prepares their report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit, the vote will pass.
It is still unclear if Mr. Cavano would get at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice President Mike Pens to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy as Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Korean passersby "screw"
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of rednecks from North Korea to South Korea declined, said South Korean legislator.
Pack Peon Seug, referring to the Ministry of Uniting Republic of South Korea, stated that the number of outbacks last year was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pack stated that key factors were increasing border control between North Korea and China, as well as that smugglers carrying illegals now demand more money for it.
Pongen's refrained from public comments.
The overwhelming majority of North Koreans eventually offer the citizenship of South Korea.
In Seoul, it was stated that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, it is easier to cross than a well protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees passersby as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea, which is still formally in a state of war, has greatly improved in recent months.
In the early part of this month, leaders of two countries met in Phangnu and discussed denuclearization issues that had been negotiated in a dead end.
This was after the June historic U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Chen In in Singapore, where they generally agreed to collaborate on the Korean Peninsula's nuclear disarmament.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Jon-Ho in the background of accepted sanctions accused the United States of failing to progress ever since.
"Having no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no single-way disarmament," said Rí Jon-Ho in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Brett Kavano "theisteric" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosy called the candidate for the Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavano "theisteric" and stated that he was by temperament not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've been thinking all the time that if a woman ever performed this way, she'd be called "isterical"," – Pelosi commented on her reaction to Cavano's testimony to the Jurid Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denied the charge of sexual violence over Dr. Christine Blazi Ford, when they were both teenagers.
During his opening words, Cavano acted very emotionally, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling charges against him "absurbary and coordinated destruction of reputation," organized Liberals, who were angered by Hillary Clinton's losing the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Caavano's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward Democrats.
"I think that by these statements, as well as his performance against Clinton and Democrats, he will personally lead his candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was outraged when she was asked if she would attempt to announce Cavano an impeachment if his fault was confirmed, and whether the majority would receive Democrats in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only worth working in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently working as a Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about possible decisions by Cavano against the "On Available Medical Care" law or the "Row Against Wade" case because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his hearings, on the issue of approval in Kavano's office, he went by side with the question of whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now isn't the time for a judge to become an hysterical, biased person and we'll say how wonderful it is," Pelosy said.
Women must own this weapon.
These are just words, which included months and years of rage, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," she said to me 45 years later, Miss Stainham.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, and you?"
She continued, "One woman who worked as executive director somewhere and helped me a lot, said that she too was crying when she was angry, but she had her own methodology.
And I'm evil."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was amazing."
Tears are considered an acceptable ventilator of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my most memorable memories of my first job in the office, with mostly men working in the office, was the situation where I once cried with unspeakable anger, and an older woman – a hostile manager whom I had always feared for a little while – grabbed me by a collar and pulled me to a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Congressman of Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an outage on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Ms. Schroeder decided there was no reason why she could not run for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"The race already involved seven other candidates, and another candidate – this is the last thing they needed."
Somebody called the situation the Whites and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she resigned in the fundraising, so she promised that she would not take part in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret the support of men of $1,000, only gave her $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she was surprised.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotion – gratitude to the people who supported her, the frustration of the system, which made it very complicated the collection of money and made it easier to focus on the voters not as much on the constituency as the members of the House of Deputees, as well as the spite of sexism, and she was willing to cry.
"You'd think I had a breakdown," recalls Ms. Schroeder's press reaction. –
You'd think Klenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was then thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
As a trade war between the United States and China can bring advantages to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and, although still far before its completion, in the long run of the split between countries may benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots at the beginning of this year, taxing basic Chinese export goods, particularly solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
The biggest situation became worse this week because of the new trade tariffs of $200 billion ($150 billion) total, which is actually taxing half of all the goods that come from China to the United States.
Beijing was retaliating the same coin every time, recently putting a tribute of five to ten percent on American goods for $60 billion.
China pledged to take similar U.S. measures, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to miss that promise soon.
Force Washington to step back means to agree with the requirements, but for China's President, the U.S. Public Worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, as experts consider, if Beijing properly uses the situation, pressures in the trade war with the United States can bring China an advantage in the long term, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic drop in any country, and this is actually a greater threat than observers have recognized before," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with the issues associated with Asia in the analytic center Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister said Syria was "ready" to return refugees
In Syria, it is claimed that they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and are seeking help in the restoration of a land devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Foreign Minister Valid al-Muall stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore devastated areas so that people can return to normal life.
Currently, all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as one-way economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their livelihood.
According to the UN, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Muall stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept help in the restoration of the devastated war of the country.
But he emphasized that they would not accept the provisional assistance or assistance from countries supporting the riot.
Europe anchors the win on the Ryder Club in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, when the U.S. team won a total score of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in a suburb of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time and has not won the Ryder Cup here since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team scored 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikelson, who worked hard for most of the tournament, scored his first long shot on the 16th hole of steam-3 in the water and gave way to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of four players who had ever been held from a 5–0–0 since the beginning of the tournament in the modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spyt was defeated at 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team of Turbierna Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the first staircase in the world rating, has surrendered to 2:1 Jan Poulter of England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup tournament for the last time.
The Spaniard Serhio Garcia, a veteran of the Ryder Club, who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who won most of the tournaments for all time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"I don't cry at all, but today I can't do anything.
It was a tough year.
Thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, so happy to get the cup back.
This is the team's credit, and I'm happy to be able to help," said, without holding the emotions, Garsia after winning in Europe.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Remu, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods in a single game at 2:1 a.m. on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France Woods lost all four games and now has a career record for the Ryder Cup 13–21–3 tournament.
Strange statistics for one of the most prominent players of all time who won 14 Méjour tournaments, giving up only to Jack Niklaus.
U.S. collection throughout the weekend tried to reach the festival zone, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau showing high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furrick said of his team after a disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we briefly dominated Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking the hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll switch, I'll work with the United States Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We cannot fail to commend them.
We lost."
