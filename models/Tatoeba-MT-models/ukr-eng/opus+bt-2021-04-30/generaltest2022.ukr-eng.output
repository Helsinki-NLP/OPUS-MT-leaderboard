Green: Maripol – heart of war, stop fighting – we'll have weak positions
President Vladimir Greenski believes that fighting east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Maripol will determine the course of the war – and if the ZSU is defeated there, the Russians can abandon negotiations and reoccupiate decoupled territories.
The direct language is, "Maripol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights – we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have more weak positions.
They are (the city's guardians – ed.) – the people who have pulled a large number of enemies away.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in (the area) OOS, and if they are more strong, the table of the pass will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a situation that's going to be weak in all these directions, we can wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia would take all of these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we're buying right now.
They can go to that too.
Then our situation in the talks will be weaker and maybe not even interesting to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we're conditioning.
We believe in our result, in our victory...."
Details: Greeny also said that going to talks after Ukrainian torture is difficult, but "we must not lose the opportunity for diplomatic solutions if we have them."
The direct language is, "People will take peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the terms of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace at any time.
But if we say no emotionally, the war must end in peace, or millions of casualties will end.
And even where a million victims come to an end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight – but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for the dust, when there's nothing, there's no people."
Good day, do you have any more free seats for a Czech adult course with 19:00 on Tuesday?

Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by news of beastly abuse from civilians north of Kiev.
Photographs of shot and shot people confused the whole civilized world.
Tens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?!!!
But I wasn't surprised at all, and it's exactly what I've been waiting for.
I took children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then, the girls-cole with the children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, she has consistently assisted the ZSU and for no time has doubted that in the case of the occupation of Kiev's suburbs, my family will not spare.
Because it was and remains absolutely certain that the essence of the rotten commune-CDBs regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937 one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a Gitomir prison.
A few years ago, in the Jewish SBU, they were granted a copy of the executive's shooting case: the whole case is over a hundred pages, but the execution sentence is very simple and even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
The ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-door" route, never in the cogs.
The fact that lived on the hamlets and had several cows was sufficient to deny the pachar and feeding of young children to death.
The relatives did not even know of the burial site.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give a false witness.
In the criminal case, there's the name of the knocker Sharry.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and I'm not surprised if it was his relative who was the KGB Informer.
An apple from an apple tree nearby is known to fall...
The emergency three, which condemned the killing of the villagers, were ethnic Russians.
Analysis of the great-grandfather's case interested in various information resources.
There are great (no sarcasm) information resources such as the "Besting Barak" that reminds us of the events of those years.
So in the modern breeding of the NCVDists' descendants, they found ways to punish and kill almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repression and publicly wrote the names of murderers – the system first discredited and then destroyed.
Like they found children's pornography files on the computer, they put her in jail, and he died there quickly.
The KGB are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Why suddenly do you wonder what they're doing now?!
There, the most cold features of human nature are concentrated.
Over a thousand years of Ordian tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were imposed.
And then on what came out, they did a beastly genetic experiment, cutting off intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 half-French film Chexist, it was.

As reported by "European Truth," Welt writes about this with reference to sources in the Government Circles of Ukraine.
According to the edition, an appropriate proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economics of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 hooks, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered by the hooks in the variant on the BRT Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While the tanks in battle must climb relatively close to the enemy's objectives, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire more than 20 miles [30 km] away.
According to Ukrainian government circles with a reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-entered hooks will follow a circular circuit.
Bundesver, in the shortest terms, gives Kiev 100 of his hooks, and the gaps formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new hooks can be placed 30 months after the contract is signed, i.e. earlier in the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Are we in the first half of the day or the second half of the day together?
Thank you.

Yesterday at the 402 bus stop, I met Victoria, a Ukrainian.

So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Holocaust Memorial Center, Babin Yar in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by the German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in the Babin Yaru.
I was privileged to perform after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must protect – this is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the wicked demons of the past will appear in new clothes today," he said, – then to us Germans, there may be only one answer: never again!
The fight must last."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombarded and killed thousands of civilians, starved residents of its blocked cities, and given them to die of disease.
Russian troops perform mass shootings by Ukrainians, even visually it resembles shootings in the Babin Yar.
For over a month, the Germans see this in real-time news.
Yes, Germany introduces sanctions, provides humanitarian aid as well as weapons that have not been possible so long ago.
Germany delays the supply of heavy arms required by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only going against the svastic.
This means fighting all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to beat evil and stop the atrocities occurring in Ukraine.
One of you's song at night

Sergei Cidorino: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociologists showed that 67% of Ukrainians were opposed to entering NATO and only 18% of those polled performed for.
After the Giant Revolution, the flight of Victor Janukovich, annexions of Crime and the beginning of the Donbasi War, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's entry into NATO among Ukrainian citizens – over 75%.
Despite supporting Ukraine's entry into NATO and the help that NATO performs in the war, there is now much criticism on the account of Alliance and members of the country – for the timeless supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "drag" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will have to give up the desire for membership in Alliance due to the RF position if this can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In the new episode of the "Clush Issues", along with the editor of "European Truth", we talk about how it has helped Ukraine Alliance since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain why our prospect of membership in NATO is close as never before in history and why the security guarantees discussed on the talks with Russia may become the second Budapest memorant.
You think it's here.

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he did not do very decent things and I left him.
After a while, he returned again and asked me to forgive him.
I refused.
Then, some time later, he phoned that his heart had been operated on.
I asked him to just talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I was psychologically supportive of him for nearly half a year.
During this time, we talked a lot.
I started to have problems in parallel at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe we need to look at it differently.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
So God himself determined our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks in Czech.
I wanted to say I was able to find a place to live, and I'm very glad I now have a place to live and have a place to be with a baby.

I won't remember any of this schedule )
Russian army threatens to strike Kiev rockets: they say "formerly didn't do that"
Conaschenkov's direct language: "We're seeing attempts at diversions and the task of hitting Ukrainian troops on objects in RF territory.
If such cases last, the RF armed forces will strike the decision-making centers, including Kiev, which the Russian army had previously abstained from."
The Russians caused missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of a full-scale invasion of the RF occupation forces in Ukraine.
On 25 February, the remains of Russian missiles that knocked down the Ukrainian PPO system fell on the apartment house on the tabletops.
On 26 February, the Russian missile hit a high-rise at the Valeria Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the television on the Roads near Baja Yaru, which resulted in the deaths of 5 passers.
On March 2, Ukrainian systems of PPO crashed over the South Railway station Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence building.
On 14 March, the debris of the hit invader missile destroyed the house and the trolleybus at Kurenovsk in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on the Vineyard, causing one person to die, 19 others injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern troville Tretroville on the vine, resulting in at least 4 deaths.
The mayor of Kiev Vitaly Clitch said again on April 13 that the inhabitants of the capital, who were evacuated from the city, were still too early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians were still able to strike Kiev rockets and that there were many mines and unrivaled ammunition in the vicinity of the capital.
The main management of Ukraine's Ministry of Defence intelligence warned on April 12, that the Russians plan to host a series of terrorist attacks in the area of the RF to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army regarding civilians.
On April 1, oilbaza exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of a Ukrainian helicopter air attack.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that a "in Ukraine shell" had fallen near the city.
It is evident that the elites in Washington, D.C., and in Berlin cast in a cold sweat at the very thought that the natto fighters would strike down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Green speaking is not as much with them as with their voters and societies in general.
By his speeches in parliaments and in front of many thousand-year-old crowds in the squares of the largest cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader does something that none of his predecessors have been able to do.
Greenish does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces European people that they choose.
And these talks, this subtle flood of strength, touch, and time of despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Bayden is strongly against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against Ukraine's quick introduction, the process is already under way.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered a fraud.

They are heroic leaders who drive to the battle zone, calm and help the refugees in the carriages, and help the volunteers to load the humanitarian cars at peace stations.

Chapter Office, President Andrew Jermack, reported that Russia is starting "feet surgery" on the weapons that the Allies are sending to us.
Jermaka's direct language is, "They understand they will lose the war, see their backlash, and seek to "beat down" weapons supplies by any means.
For example, one of the last fairies is the bucimto destruction passed by Slovakia CRC S-300.
This information has already been refuted by Premier Edward Heger.
We know the script of the Russians.
They can launch festivals that Ukrainian soldiers bucimto seem to have weapons from the allies, and it moves massively into the arms of the Russian army.
I want to warn you right now.
For the weapons in the hands of the men of the ZSU exclusively send the enemy to that world.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as "provotion".
"The reports of killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are worth conviction," said New Zealand Prime Minister Jasinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
"Rosia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in her fight against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called incidents "a violation of international law".
Statements were made after reports of hundreds of civilians being shot and thrown into the fraternities or left on the streets in the suburb of Kiev, in the Bush by Russian troops who left this area after the occupation for several weeks.
Photographs that allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with bound hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal persecution of the guilty.
France's president, Emmanuel Macron, stated in a radio interview on 4 April that there are signs that Russian troops committed "war crimes" in Bush.
"What happened in Bouch requires a new sanction round and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bush.
"We will make sure that those who committed these war crimes will not remain without punishment," said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late April 3, the Russian Navy spokeswoman Maria Zaharov rejected the charge as "provotion".
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had "arranged" images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after these materials appeared does not raise any doubt about who "ordered" this story," said Zaharov.
Before Russia's Minor Defenses also said without evidence that Bush's images were "another production of the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city until March 30.
Moscow asked the United Nations Security Council to gather on 4 April to discuss what it called "a provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Bush.
On April 4, Russia's investigative committee published a statement in which he announced a "investigative investigation" on charges of spreading to Ukraine "knownly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bush.
President Vladimir Greensky spoke on April 3, accusing the Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told the Kreml executives that they were supposed to come to Bushi to see what their military had done.
"I want all leaders of the Russian Federation to see their orders executed," said Greenski in video conversion, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shootings in the back," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people bound behind their back and beheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bushie, cities about 35 kilometres northwest of Kiev.
A Ukrainian correspondent for Freedom Radio on April 2 saw a small city of bodies as if civilian on the streets.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
The AP journalists saw bodies of at least 21 people in different locations of the Bush.
The bodies of one group of nine people – all in civilians – were scattered on land near the site, which local residents said used Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from a close distance.
Overall, Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the Kiev area, which was controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything's, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told, Kiev isn't." As the occupationrs subjugated the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by horrible things: looting, rapes, murders, tortures.
This list has another item about which there is far less information currently – the eviction of the local population to enemy territory.
From about mid-March, Russian invaders "evacuee" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the area of Belarus, which was self-proclaimed by President Lukashenko actually gave under Russian military polygon.
The Ukrainian Truth sought out displaced Ukrainians and their relatives to question how the same "evacuation" is going on and if there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
This text's heroesses have joined the voluntary-force evacuation beyond Ukraine under psychological pressure and from the non-conventional.
Fortunately, they're alive and in contact with their families.
However, in view of the claims of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
Thus, in Melitopoli, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity home, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Mirosław, the daughter of Ukraine's dead champion from the voyage of Joseph Zachepitsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostelle a few months before the war.
Alexander was given a job at the Antonow Airport, located two miles (2.5 km) from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, even though they were civilians.
As true cereals, Denise and Marina had previously collected disturbing suitcases, but on the morning of February 24, they failed to evacuate.
They didn't have their car, and the suburban buses didn't take anyone.
At about 12 o'clock on the 24th of February, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One hit a nearby house.
Then the family descended into the basement and remained there for the long three weeks, until 17 March, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not all of them decided.
"O 6th evening of February 24th, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They say, "Is that a whore?" – I say yes. – "You're going!".
They searched me, asking me if there were weapons in the basement.
All the men were questioned whether they served in the army.
The women said, "We've come to protect you on Ramsan Kaderov's orders."
It was Chechen OMON, not even an army, young boys aged 25-35.
They said, "We've been helped in the war by the Ukrainians, Sascha White (in command of the UNA-UNSO nationalist movement, which fought on the side of Chechens in the first Russian-chen War – the UP), now we've come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say that the water, with it, was a big problem.
They broke up the store, took the goods out of there under the drive "all of the rockuscule takeover" and brought us 6 dollars.
There's another video on the internet where kids thank Kadyrov for the food.
So that's what they do after the store's robbery, they bring in sausages and they say, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramsan Ahmatovich."
No one especially wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You've got seven days to give our phones back" – they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want the wars, the Ukrainians support the good ones at all, "Putin is a bastard, Kadiro too, but we can't do anything, because our families are there."
And mostly they didn't fight, but they were going to loot stores, and they were going to war.
Chickens were driven, one was tied to one leg of a geogie tape, and to another, their white scotch was called "silent".
They arrived in Ukraine not prepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked...when they were beaten at Bush, so they didn't even get killed, they asked us, "Do you have an artillery?"
Moreover, we had raised troops – Chechens between each other did not know, in the early days they asked for passwords to discover whether they were theirs or the stranger.
They were there until 13 March, after which the Russian OMON came, and behind them is the omesian Dean.
They put 30-40 units of technology between the houses – ours were constantly falling into it from the Biarakaratarians.
But these came and told us that the ZSU is no longer gone, but there is an "Azov" and, according to them, "Azow" is now 100 in Ukraine.
He's had "Kiaves already surrendered" advanced since early March.
One day, a Russian – either a Dean's officer or FSB's representative – came to our door and says there's going to be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio – there was about Buchu, Gostelle, thinking maybe we had a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we gave Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "Weas are taken to Belarus and then maybe to Rostove."
We say we don't want either there or there.
To which they replied, "So beg for your children's mental health!"
As it worked, they driven us into the basement and started shooting from under the house – or "Grads" or mortars.
And then came back... the neighboring houses just burnt down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had direct entry into the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the borderers and the Red Cross.
Part didn't go, saying it was for traitors of the homeland – saying, "you'll be shot there, sold to the authorities."
We were taken across Chernobyl, on both sides of the road were hot, broken technology, although the bilorussians told that the Russian techniques were immediately taken to them.
Too many chaplains, buried techniques, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian point of the "Comar", we went through impromptu control, many were without papers at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in the Red Cross tents, given tea.
And here we hear shots! Shoots the rocket, and you can see the trail – it worked Iskandar in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross were saying, "No, they're planes flying, turning to the border."
But we're from aviation, we're educated, we know what it is.
We were then crowded into a bus and taken to the Choks sanctions near Gomel.
His supervisor came, Wenger Vasyl Stephenovich, says, "Well, I'm a hool, I'm with Cherniegova.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko won't be left over, but those eyes of yours are not finished.
The poor people are on the run!
We've got Lukashenko that good!
He'll be like that."
There was an interview with Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted it.
The sanction's administration told us, "But you're already traitors!"
And people from the United Nations Red Cross and Representation (at least they were called) spread the misinformation that men in Poland can't travel.
Many believed it and feared to leave Belarus.
But we did decide to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents – our daughters had no passport.
We were to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war broke out.
In the Ukrainian consulship, we were not helped, and in Minsk at the station, they said no one would take anybody on the bus without passports.
I'll tell you what helped us very much by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escorts were carried out.
There was no force in the sanction.
Our second group of migrants said you could live the maximum week of the quarter, because Belarus – it's not Europe, there's no pay.
We found an inside carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled near Mozier (about 50 kilometres from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw the launch of the ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first flies out, shines beautifully, and then goes out.
The people who boarded the bus in Moziri said the Russians were constantly shooting out of the Polgons.
But I can say the bilorussians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are fired from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, do not believe at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
It is not perceived that their polygoons are used to shoot Ukraine.
Friends were waiting in Poland to take us to Estonia.
Now we're going through the registration, and we're going to decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now probably as many as Estonians."
Marina lived in the territory of a military town in Gostelle along with her brother's family – his wife and two children, the 18th and the 22nd.
In the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the basics and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of a nearby house.
Maryna herself couldn't go home and in principle won't be able to – the house is gone.
No one knew anything about evacuation.
Can't you go downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we've got everything. We're always waiting for you.

On 1 April, the town chairman of the Buchi Anatoli Fedoruk announced a glad report – Ukrainian military on 31 March freed the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the invaders were expelled from the entire Kiev area.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians should have felt at this point was eclipsed by horror and hatred, for at the same time it was known that in the same time, at least 280 civilians had been shot by the Russians in one Bush alone.
They were killed right on the street, some were tied hands and shot in the back, some killed – minors.
Murdered and followed the tortures found the oldman of the village of Motijin Olgu Suchenko, her husband Igor, and Alexander's son, who were kidnapped on 23 March.
The bodies of Olga and Alexandra were in the brother's grave, Igor to the sewers.
A roundway 20 km from Kiev revealed the bodies of several stripped women wrapped in blankets.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there'll be no one at home.

President Vladimir Greenski stated that certain weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
On this point he said in an interview with Associated Press, a excerpt published by the President's Office, writes "European Truth."
"All the equipment, everything they're already sending, for some types of equipment it's done too late.
So what if, for example, we're talking about Maripol, when you're losing thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's right.
And some European leaders have changed positions, but you see the price of these changes," said Green.
On the question of that, it was enough of the weapons that Ukraine got to make a difference in the war, the president replied, "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not be, or it would have a different appearance.
"She would expand in a different way, we'd have a shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be wars," he added.
Remember, the British Prime Minister promised Ukraine new military aid, which includes armory and counter-creative weapons.

And then he made me an offer.

"We've been hiding from our mother-in-laws about war.
So far it's been successful.
However, in Plack (kimka – UP) on the flue and hind legs, the fur has been surrounded – this can be from stress, a change in the corm and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, and here's the stress I don't think of, unfortunately.
The bottle, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Because Olga doesn't hear well and most of her time is spent in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Pam Pam Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, like a guerrilla, lived with her in an apartment.
It was hidden from both the war and the fact that I was there – formally came as always for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receiver back – she listened to four hours, then she sang for two hours."
The radio has always been near the bed.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
It doesn't feel good - it allowed me to be imperceptible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walks," I hid in my room.
First, she hid the receiver and the TV.
It's 6-7 people.
She asked to talk to her about anything, but not war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning and to the end.

The British, who in the ZSU's ranks defended Maripol, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a Marine Corps Brigade Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who is involved in the defense of Mariupoli, told his friends and family that they would form arms and surrender to Russian invaders.
Source: Two-page Aiden Eislin, a British who served in ZSU's ranks since 2018, VVS with a reference to members of the family and friends of Eislin, Atlas News with a reference to the words of a friend Eslin who spoke to him
Verbally, twitter Eislin: "We received a message from him, "It took 48 days, we tried everything we could to protect Maripol, but we have no choice but to give in to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war is about to end."
Detail: Eislin served in the 36th separate Navy Marine Corps Brigade, which participates in Mariupoli's defensive operation.
VWS journalists contacted the mother of military servant Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had reported on the phone that they were planning to appear captive.
Military's friend Brennan Philips also confirmed to reporters that in his last phone conversation, Eislin told of the plans of their unit from surrender.
He said that the teams had run out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said Aislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units to avoid getting without weapons and bullets to the hands of the so-called "cadivores".
Also in the social media, there was an audio recording of a phone conversation on which it was alleged that Eislin was talking to his familiar American friend, who plans to travel to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Eislin said they were trying to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British used to say that in Instagram, he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagger.
Eislin was a social worker in Newarkon Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to engage in fighting against the terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ZSU's ranks and vowed a vow.
Aislen's friends and close ones called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known under the noxneum of Cossack Gundi.

According to the memories of "some dead silence standing in the city".
Of course, one of the residents ran from house to house.

When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition you have, we've got this going on Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council passed a bill of 716, which is titled "To execute monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economy."
It is strange that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economy has turned out to be... a place under which members of the overseen board are held and kept.
Legislators of the Legislative believe that decision-making by the overseen council of the authorities in conditioned Kiev can somehow solve national security issues of Ukraine.
We know of many new dangers for the staff, but as far as it is unknown of any company that has the need to physically hold the board's supervision meetings at the location.
The potential threat of such a law is clear – this is a great basis to "bear" all gains in heavy reform holders after the Giant Revolution, including independent oversight boards, and then set up manual management.
The one that was before 2015.
Why should the board's staff be held, and who should join them?
More than that – if under patriotic slogans one harmful law enforcement can fly off tomorrow – for example, the state purchase system can be demolished via ProZorro or NBU independence.
Much can be attributed to war.
This initiative, by the way, appeared before the outbreak of war and a bill of 716.
So on 22 February, this standard was introduced to the comparative table of the billboard of 5397.
In general, though, the desire to disband the board in one way or another is circulating among some of the national electors long ago.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider arguments that explained the necessity of accepting it.
And then let's put on our proposals to solve the issue of managing the holdings during the war.
The first Minister of Economics, Denis Kudin, explained the need for such innovation by risking internet loss and other means of communication that would make it impossible for the remote work of oversight councils to be done.
In other words, the risk is that the board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in terms of what the company's job might be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, yet will it not be able to prevent its members from moving to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a pretty cynical situation where independent members of the board (which make up most of the composition) will put their personal safety ahead of the company's interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In such a case, they can be released under a bill.
And then, most likely, it will result in the loss of the quadrom required by the supervision council to make any decisions.
Instead, it is quick to appoint new independent members of the board of oversight as the law implies the need to hold a competitive selection, which on average lasts for 3-4 months.
Thus, a bill offered by the 7776 decision will likely not be able to prevent loss by the supervision board of the possibility of making decisions, but rather, will lead to it!
The national MP, author of the Legislator Dmitro Nataluaha, gives other arguments to support it.
In particular, he notes, "many businesses, particularly the defensive and industrial complex (OPC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensational information."
To begin with, there are almost no U.S.P.A. custody agencies in Ukraine at all.
The board is except in the Ucrofortum, which is essentially managed by almost all the UPC enterprises.
But even in the Urcrofortum, according to the legislation, the board of oversight has a rather limited authority, and all its members do duties not without a proper basis.
All of the full power in the Ucrofort is owned by the CEO, who will, by the way, make decisions as to the need for a location of one or the other of the UPC businesses that are part of the concerna.
In addition, this argument does not stand the criticism of a 776 bill that does not bring about any changes in legislation that regulates the activities of the UPC authorities at all.
Mr Dmitri on his Facebook page also cites arguments that can be referred to as the "emotional" category.
Such arguments generally have nothing to do with improving the effectiveness of the work of the staff and the banks, but let's try to analyze some of them too: "several alien experts at the first word "war", as early as 2021, leave Ukraine, but remain members of the surveillance boards in Ukraine's state enterprises with full stock of several hundred thousand bucks, while Ukraine itself is truly suffering from war."
First of all, it's a manipulation – most of these surveillance council members never lived in Ukraine and only occasionally came here.
So to say that they're "leave Ukraine" is unfair, to say the least.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian surveillance council members have long resorted to the practice of conducting online meetings.
This instrument has long been common in world practice, with in absolutely different areas: business, education, medicine, and so on.
Not to be forgotten, too, that the board's membership is not the work of full-time.
Generally, such people have other employment, and the actual means of electronic communication help them to do so.
Third, all these statements are read as claims solely to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmitri does not express identical claims to the members of the oversight boards that are Ukrainians?
Because they're not at the site of their companies either.
To say, this is far from the first popular attempt of MPs to remove foreigners from the surveillance councils, and war is only a new convenient opportunity.

We usually need one of the adults' passports.
In the Brovarsk, the Wishgorod and the Bochańsk Regions of Kiev, who were freed from the occupations, will introduce an increased curfew by 2 days.
Pavuk's direct language: "In the settlements of Brovarski, Vishgorod and Bochański Districts, which were under Russian occupation and were released by Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew increased!
In the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will be imposed on 21st April 2 to 06:00 April 5".
Details: According to the head of the siege, at this time it is strongly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to travel by transport and on foot.
Residents can only walk out on the street during alarm signals to move into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the effects of Russian aggression – to clean and mine territory.
Omelianuk called on people who had left these areas so far to refrain from returning home.
At the rest of the region of Kiev, the curfew will take place daily from 11:00 to 6:00 p.m.

In the Navy, Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the strong support of the SABR Special Representatives, three Bobrooks were detained, one was injured.
According to the Clears, while holding men, they were active in resistance and tried to escape.
Safety forces used weapons.
One of the detainees has been injured and in medical facility.
Others were given medical care in place.
The Chief of the Criminal Police of the MVS Belarusiani Hendi Kazaquević stated that "the attacks of terrorism on the RB railway will be severely discontinued" by gun-using forces.
On 6 April, it was reported that on 30 March, the police detained another member of the Belarusian Railway, a member of the Baronavsky Department of the BJ, and the administrator of the theme resources of the BBC in the "Contactue" and "Odno-class" Valentine Samuska.
Where it is now and in what state is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, no less than 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for the division.
Remember: BYpol's formation, announced by the Lucashenka regime of extremite, continues to call for the bilorsions to be carried out on railway transport and Belarus infrastructure as part of the "Permoga" plan.

United States ban investment in RF and issue sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States together with the G7 and the EU introduce new sanctions against the daughters of President RF Putin, the largest banks of RF Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and ban all new investments in Russia.
This is mentioned in a report on the White House.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution owned by the government, and Alpha Bank – the largest private bank.
The sites will freeze any of their assets relating to the U.S. financial system, and will prevent U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will enforce a full ban on new investments in the RF.
For this purpose, U.S. President Joe Byden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on approved over 600 transnational companies decision making from Russia.
The release of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as legal and consulting firms," says the White House statement.
A third step in new sanctions from the United States has been to restrict against large Russian state enterprises in the critical field.
This will prevent U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the United States jurisdiction.
A detailed list of Minfin will be published on the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is a complete ban on the assets of Putina's adult children, wife and daughter of Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex President and Prime Minister of Russia Dimitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishustin
The sites shut them down from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

My name is Olga, before the war, I worked as a flight attendant for SkyAp, my mom, a seam of industrial products, a son of Macarke went to the garden.
We lived beautiful, but we didn't even think we were forced to flee because there was no more strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and I found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope for the first time that someone will give us a chance to even pay for a room or an apartment, but if it's on our own.
Cleanliness and order guarantees.
We do not have harmful habits.
Let us be grateful for such help at such a simple time.
I had an English lecture in the afternoon and then went to work in the children's room.
There I explained to Margaret how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she gets it all and it'll work out well.
And I also met Mrs. Lena talking to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.

I Dreamed to Be a Teacher
My girls can't move anywhere now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you heard for information, you'd let me know.
I'd be happy to rent a place with some decent girl.
If you might know one, let me know.
I'm not going to let you down on my side.
Thank you early.
I haven't written to you yet, Natalie, 54 years old. Please write to the exact address and how much the course costs.
I think it's best for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
My name wasn't changed. It's one since I was born:
Good morning, Mr. Reirard, I'm sorry I haven't seen it, I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna send it to you right away.
We're going to the meditation team right now.

We'll do it somehow.
But how would it be paid, please, no credits.
Write me straight, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.

Should we take the clothes we gave?
It's not my day today, the blinds in the living room broke.
Something came from you, I can't see that
I'm also very sad.
I'll remind you later on.
You only have a dad speaking and understanding Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to make a house clean and how many windows does the house have?
I'm ashamed to distract you from what you're doing.
Good evening, I can't share it with you.
I'd like to read to Joe Dispens, he's researching the impact of external factors and the formation of new connections neurons.
TV journalist Natalie Nagorna published on the morning of April 12, a video that was handed to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupoli.
In it the military say they have no weapons left to take part in the battles and the mountain of the wounded.
They said that "counting takes hours."
Prior to this, on April 11, 36th, a separate Marine Corps Brigade, which is involved in the defense of Mariupoli, has published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupoli, and the Ukrainian military command was not tied to the fighters for two weeks.
The social media voiced the sepsis that the statement had published in Russian.
The Chief Commander of Ukraine's Armed Forces, Valery Hallic, assured that the command relationship to the defense forces in Mariupoli is, and the details of the defensive operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the area of Azovstal in Mariupoli and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a toxic substance on Maripol from unknown origin.
As reported by the leader of Azova, Andrew Bellecki, the RF Army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by the Azov Regiment fighters.
Thank you, I'll fit under you, that would be very good.
The situation is the same, so far we're staying here
2 Time to drive ) walk, mom shopping and back!
It's not an important thing.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The Czechō drone squadron has begun flying over Ukraine since today.
Nearly 50 professional coptersō will serve to detect, and individual ones will be for the direct destruction of the enemy invader.
Two Zacarpathian and two Czech brothers of "ptak" to Ukraine were sent before yesterday thanks to Mukachev City Council of Vladimir Labutek.
Today, for their intertribal friends led by the head of the village council and the coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplewhere101/ Vasil Shield delivered the drones for appointment: they were received special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities, where fighting is currently ongoing.
In order to make the most effective and safe use of the copters, their dislocation is now to be kept secret.
The four friends helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic on the action are not planning to stop, say that many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine in the coming days, which will serve as the destruction of the Russian occupation and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I love sweetness, but I can't have it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
soon back to Ukraine, continue to work
All right, if it's all right, I'll do it.
I'm going to try it myself, but if you get lost I'll write you if you can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the senior lady in the village in Java, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said there was no housing
Maybe she'll be glad and she'll feel better.
I was repaired by the phone today.
And I think I'm freezing on the street today, too.
She drank medication and tea, I feel worse, but not critically.
I'm sorry, too, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.

It was colder today and it was raining, and there should be heat tomorrow.
But not sorry for the ruined houses, the pity for the people being mistreated by the invaders.
In Herson, the occupationrs were ridding themselves of the Slaw of Ukraine Memorial in Herson on the Street of Percopus.
Details: It is noted that unknowns broke the flag of the European Union, crushed panels with photographs of Heaven's hundreds, and killed in the Russian- Ukrainian War.
Occupants ripped off portraits of heroes of Heaven's hundreds and dead participants in the Russian and Ukrainian War.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thank the kids for the carol, we don't have this custom so we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to be given

Hello, it's a little better now.
He was already in the pit tonight.
Even today, I was sleeping there.
So we are making a lot of progress.
I'll definitely bring the cooks another time!
today I have no strength to do them
As I push away from the days and times in which the cleaning work is done after the guests, I can say roughly on April month because I already have an approximate house cleaning schedule.
In May of the month, I'll be able to say something at the end of April or the beginning of May.
Just asked if you had anything to say about it....
Hey, I'm sorry I haven't written in long enough to make dinner and get some sleep.

Hey, it went really well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people in such high office.
Today she had a lesson from a lady who is the director of the land's economy department.
She was very pleased with my work.
The grice in the pits was fine.
On Monday, I have to get confirmation of my employment as well as cash payment for the pits.

Subdivision of headquarters: Russia prepares provocation in the Pridays to accuse Ukraine
The Russian Army may resort to provocations in the Pridaystrous region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine "in aggression against the neighboring state."
It is literally: "It is not ruled by the armed forces of the Russian Federation of Provocative Action in the Pridrian Region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for action on the Slobboan direction.
Likely in the coming days, the invaders will try to recover the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send a personal composition, arms, and equipment to participate in combat activities in the territory of Ukraine.
The training of arms and military techniques is being made at the point of permanent dislocation of the 60th separate moto-gun Brigade (Monastirish) of the 5th Russian Army of the Eastern Military District.
Likely, the marked arms will be moved to temporarily occupied areas of the Donetsk area.
Also in order to recover the loss of the individual member units of the Battalion tactical group from the 36th separate moto-gun Brigade (Borza, Zabaykal Country) unit 29 of the Russian army of the Eastern Military District is carried out by a set of military personnel from the designated Brigade.
The enemy especially feels the problem when he sets up driving and driving mechanics.
The stay of the selected individual composition from the permanent dislocation is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the opponent, in order to disrupt the delivery of cargo to the battlegrounds, will continue to strike vehicles in the country's transport infrastructure in order to destroy them or release them.
The defined units of the Military Forces of Belarus continue to carry out the task of increasing the security of the Ukrainian-white border in the Brest and the Gomel region.
In the Slobbohanian direction, individual units from the 6th Public Army and coastal troops of the northern fleet continue to partially block the city of Harkov, continuing to take up artillery shootings of the city.
In the Ijum direction there is an air exploration of the area in order to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To that end, the opponent applies the BPLA to Orlan-10.
With forces to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to attack in the directions of the inhabited areas of Long Lake and Dmitri, the success did not and withdrew to previously occupied positions.
In the Donnek direction, the opponent of the main efforts continues to focus on taking control of the Posagna, Rubízhne, Lower, and Nobahmut, as well as establishing full control of the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to storm the Gold area, and he had no success.
In the city of Maripol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue to storm in areas of the Azovstall plant and sea port.
With the forces of individual units, the enemy carried out artillery shootings of Ukrainian troops in areas of populated areas of Highpil, Trudovic, and Mariana.
Four enemy attacks have been reflected in the territory of the Donetsk and Lugan Region by defenders of Ukraine during the past day, destroyed by five tanks, eight units of armored, six units of automobile technology, and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Don't you understand what you're thinking?
We'll usually try to make it through, but I doubt
How can you sleep and I hold you back
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me tonight, so tell me, I'll get it all.)
Thank you, we haven't watched the TV at home, and more than 1+1.
I'm here to turn on the television exclusively to listen to Czech language
I'm running out of tariff for a month :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidering, canva, threads for embroidering
I understand I can prepare the material in this field.
I'm going to ask her, I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us pies, too.
We'll meet my father after, definitely ›
I've read an appearance in the Facebook, so I guess Google has something on his writing. , I think the phone number is enough.
Good afternoon, we've brought the things you brought, but there's things you can bring them to us in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director is in charge, I can start going to work from the next week because I'm planning to go to the office to go to work tomorrow and give the papers (if they're done because the queues are very big) and on Saturday, rain :)
Looking for a Brigade at the beginning, I enjoyed high school chemistry, studying Czech, to know perfectly, to work at Tewi
Friends of old or not, friends I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you have a hard time too.
During the last month, I've been talking to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy without it, has turned from its feet to its head as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame due to the actions of your country in relation to your neighbours.
Because of why they're subject to Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been in danger, and you've been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memora".
I'll tell you a little later – as usual, Sash's smooth answer. – Right after the search, we walk through the ruins.
Others – cultural leaders, artists, critics, writers – struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked in the Memorial, in the New paper, at the Echo of Moscow, in the Meduzi, Naval and in a series of other places – did many of you at least do anything to oppose this regime?
Except for participating in rallies while they were still happening.
Read also a column of Russian journalist "The Late Hide, It's Too Late to Keep Quiet"
And if so, are you sure your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around you, to your apathy, and to your passive singing, which may now have been a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always that way.
In the 1990s, there was a short period of time when you had to some extent freedom and democracy – chaotic even bloody, but genuine.
But the 1991th year proved to be no better than the 1917s.
Why does every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of the mud that you seek salvation behind the king, let his name Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you don't think it's safe next to him.
Indeed, errors were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did in the neck, you took your soul off on the monument of the Dzery – and allowed the KGB to settle to the bottom, update, transform, and take over the country.
When you were given a choice between the country's robbery and the communist return, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became a major concern.
He then appeared Putin, a young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started to compare Chechnya to the ground again, most of you closed your eyes to that.
I remember well those years.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping the victims from a bannish "anti-terrorist surgery," and with my eyes I saw the ruins of Grosov, Qatar Yurta, Itum Kala, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and hang out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the tortures of civilians, of killed children, of soldiers who sold bodies to their families.
You told me, "Breed, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I resented, "My friends, it's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your power that will bomb one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came an economic rise in the middle of the zeros due to increasing oil prices and a willingness to point out that some of the stolen money would remain in middle-class pockets.
Many of you have made a good living, some have become wealthy, and even the poorest of you have acquired new housing and have found better jobs.
Prices grew, but isn't that a problem?
Moscow was celebrated and bald from the neck.
When several oppositionors were killed – Yuria Szczekočin, Ann of Politkov, Alexander Litsuke, and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was going on.
However, the matter did not go on.
When, after two terms, Putin passed President Medvedev's post, and he himself served as premiere, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When after a few months of Medvedev's rule Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or conspired.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gujari, in the foothills of Kasbegi or in the cafe and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it's unlikely that we in the West did a lot of things if we did anything at all.
A little outrage, a little sanction; but what was the significance of Russia's breaking international law when such a great temptation to Russian oil, gas, and an inner market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, that was the most important.
However, in late 2011, you, my Russian friends, did wake up.
When Putin switched places again with Medvedev and placed the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you massed out on protests.
Naval's name became provocal, you weren't walking out of the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt in horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
Initially, alternative action was organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some were given huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The country is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Disgusted by the Provosian President who had tricked their European hopes, they once captured Maidan – and never left him again.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared for a determined defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began defending themselves with the help of sticks, armatures, and some of Molotova's cocktails.
Finally the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
The refugee became Januković, and the Ukrainians returned democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and expel them if they did a bad job.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
So, using the overall confusion, he captured Crime.
Some of you were opposed, yet the benefits were few.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported annexia.
From there a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putina and his hat suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adore it.
It's hard for me to find a reason, because right after that, we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you were a new one hiding in books, movies, ICEA catalogs and parks, away as new after the restoration, which the mayor of Moscow started in 2012, – with their binbegs, widely available to the Vayfa and the Hipster department.
Indeed, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it only gets better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
WILDON or whatever, even the Moscow editor, who released my book on Syria, criticized it then in an interview, because I didn't really understand what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I've traveled there and I've seen the government snipers shooting cold-blooded at my kids' peers on the streets.
There were only your soldiers among all Russian citizens who started bombing thousands of civilians in 2015, having experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
"First they came to socialists, but I spoke – for I am not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I spoke – because I'm not a member of the union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I spoke – because I'm not Jewish.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you have been told about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some really speak now – such as Dimitri Gloukhovsky, Michael Schishkin, Michael Zigar, Maxim Osipal, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from overseas, some – from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovannikov, risking getting into the new GLAG or making a Naval company.
As for others, you know best where you live.
So I'm sure you realize that when Putin gets out with the Ukrainians – or what seems very likely if he doesn't get it, – he'll take care of you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously but mostly in private took up protests and were still a minor term, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you, who signed the petition, who expressed a disagreement in social networks (see even a black square in Instagram) or spoke out in private conversations with fellow workers at work.
Times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation were given just for the anecdot, not so far from the past – and now they, with great likelihood, are waiting for you in the future.
Who will say for you then?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – is a scary mode of transit: they argue that you can fight it.
And that mind, motivation, and courage can stop it, however oppressive it may be on the paper of its advantage.
Given everything, few in Russia realize it as well as what the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know well what's going on.
You read overseas news on the internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you maintain contact.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know where everything goes.
A beautiful life in exchange for your silence ran to an end.
Your election is just a hobby, your laws, if not to take into account the repressive, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media no longer, your economy is ruined faster than I write, you don't have any credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if any flights remain.
Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try either go somewhere or you're crushed.
I doubt you can see another option.
And yet there's another one left.
Who will eventually break this regime.
And maybe under the circumstances that were made, you would need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark won't flash from you: because of the economic collapse coming on Russia, it will probably burn in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices went down and wages did not pay, the people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, would go out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is you friends of mine.
But if each city goes out on rallies itself, as it has already happened periodically, it won't be hard for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be required. the crowd will have to be converted to mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool – the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be fixed under almost any circumstances.
The Naval organization was broken down but can be created by others, more informal, more decentralized.
You're so many, you're millions.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.
If it comes out over 300,000, it'll be stunned.
We have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it gets to work?
After all, what did he force them to do in Ukraine, all he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel an understanding fear; but those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid in your place too.
In the case of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happened to those who dare to neglect their host who dare not only demand freedom but are really trying to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in the online computer game – and will be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the internet – and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake – and die in a raw cell under police doubles.
This is what has been happening for many years – and will only continue to increase as we grow bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice, if you don't do anything, you know what that's going to end.
Act coolly, think strategically, and reach for this to become a reality.
We were on Friday night, and we were told that we could come on Monday
We'll be home in the evening
What You See Me as Secretary's Press
Hey, how often do you go to dinner in a expensive restaurant?
Once in the stream, I'm looking for dinner in a expensive restaurant.
I'm going to try and explain everything to her.)
That's how we liked it. It's very nice and we wanted something better that's why it's a better option.
I went to a place where there were lots of people, and I was tired of energy.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, voice, weakness, and head spinning
I have to go to that government of labor.
We've already done this, but we've told you who got registered in April only at the end of the month
On Thursday, we need a pass, go to the doctor with the children.
But at night, I was writing to a lady who liked your job, and she'd like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'll be sure to report it.
While working at the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental job in which I was completely disappointed.
Very sorry for the time lost, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicative, but I am committed to marriage as well.
There was one man I had to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I think that to create a family, people will have to love, respect, trust each other.
I haven't met that one yet.
Hello. Where can the forms be purchased in the Yigliwa to dry the paste(paper or milicon)?
Okay, thank you for the advice, then I'm going to put the Val's certificate in the application.
She has a DCP in a lying state, she's now having a leg broken in a gyps, a wheelchair in a lying position, an eda all wiped out in a blender
Mr. Reilhard, I'm sorry I'm bothering you at a non-working time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went in the game room today to Natalie, to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
For when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child, for she said she had come to see things and to put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our children's room until 7:00 p.m.
Is that really the case?
The room's working time until 4:00 p.m.
And eventually, that is our responsibility.
But I don't have a hard time not opening the very weak Internet
Good afternoon, we're good at it. Colia's working well, she filled the stalls yesterday, and I studied with the seniors before the exam at the high school.
It's the hardest time to take out from geometry.
On Saturday, Vladimir helped us.

Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We Are Thankful for Our Housing
Yeah, well, I thought you didn't fill in.
