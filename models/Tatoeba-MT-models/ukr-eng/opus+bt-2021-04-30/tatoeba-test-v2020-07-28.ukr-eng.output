I can't confirm it.
Mary guarantees it.
I got on the wrong bus.
I turned down the offer.
Mary already did what she was supposed to do.
I watched Tom.
Did you keep the table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like that one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you dead.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Would you recognize this man?
How about a picnic trip.
We couldn't buy tickets for the concert until we got the money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary in.
Tom doesn't play tennis very well.
I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
That's why you need you here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People living in a place cannot get to know the satisfaction of living in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want cheeseburger, colo and potatoes fri.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom's wrong.
All right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do it.
Who doesn't have the radio?
Your singing makes professional singers turn red from shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom is deaf.
It was big.
Tom knows that didn't do it to Mary.
Esther is a lesbian euretic.
Last week I was bitten by a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
Tom is unlikely to forget how this is done.
Do you drink?
Tom's gonna do it with you?
Are you awake?
The meeting began on the fifth day.
Mary said she likes to do that.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I was only in Tokyo once.
I got an electric bill.
What's the color of his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be okay.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do so.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this with?
We are content with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing in the door.
She wept bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that the man Mary?
She'll find out for herself.
A Witness who has seen everything with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom returned to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for hours a day.
Tom's done.
When I entered the room, she played the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They did not lose hope.
Tom threw eggs at Mary.
When are you expecting to come?
Tom made his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We have to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party was going?
Mary's tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll bite you.
I don't want any more.
Do you know how much she likes the colors?
I guess Tom won't be here tonight.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're glad.
I'm jealous of your good health.
Yes, I'd be happy to!
She started playing the old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
Spring soon.
It speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why would you tell me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We have to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning to stay for a while?
When are you planning to go to Japan?
My kids are at school.
I put my suitcase in.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
You can get salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom's very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat lunch.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane flew at exactly nine.
Tom is quite fluent in French.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom wiped out with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I've got a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She could not defend herself.
Next month Tom leaves Boston.
It's still hot.
Let's kiss it.
Every year millions of people die of hunger.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
The letter had an incorrect address.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all in chocolate.
They switched to another religion.
I should be careful.
I jumped them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a weird person.
I just cut my hair.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I suppose I'll buy a new car.
We're the only ones to blame.
You're so cute.
It's going to cost about fifteen dollars.
I burst the door.
His theory is noteworthy.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
That's how Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You sang.
I've done everything perfectly.
I love writing.
Kyoto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
The following month I turn sixteen.
Do you think there's a probability that this will happen?
Accept your dreams.
When will your last lesson end?
I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like that dog.
I tried to contact her.
What's she got?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary do it.
We have to help Tom.
It's been raining all day.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom will go to Boston.
Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Keep quiet.
The sun shines during the day and the moon is at night.
I got up on her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have a problem with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Mary - your girlfriend?
London covered the mist.
I'm very glad you're here, Tom.
Tom is weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
You usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to conduct it.
Step aside.
He's in the kitchen.
Please, don't be mad.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
Brazilian capital, Brazil

I still have to pay the bill for the phone.
Tom knows how to cook.
That music makes him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve a rest.
Here's the fresh ones.
Tom has huge eyes.
There are seven colors in the rainbow.
I guess that's why you shouldn't do that.
He's grumpy today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his frank opinion.
Aren't you on duty tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your woman doing, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has many friends.
That would be unfair.
That's where either you or Jane should go.
If I were you, I'd ignore that.
Tom will be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
You think I'm kidding?
Today I was very tired.
I'm true.
Happiness is not about possessing many things.
The news spread throughout Japan.
Tom showed it to the side of the mountain.

I heard him go down the stairs.
That's mine, give it to me.
How strange!
Do you know how to read Cyrillic?
I know Tom quite well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom is neat, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole.
Tom gave you something for me?
I would never be able to do that without your help.
I always have coffee and peas for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't have breakfast.
I'm the best.
How was your exam?
Can I pay later?
Did that just happen?
Mary did not take an umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
To be honest, I told a lie.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.

I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she did not.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I was too ashamed.

I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
Today I have a good appetite.
We are comfortable in our new home.
There are only two infinite things in the world, the universe, and human folly.
She said, "I'm very happy."

He signed a check.
Hey, how you doing?
The password is "Muiriel".
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Take the trash out.
You're my friend.
He has two cars.
They realized.
No problem!

Birds can see the earth's magnetic field with their eyes.
You need a car?
That's Tom's signature.
What's really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
You're planning on doing it somehow?
Am I being made clear?
I'm free this afternoon.
Tom's probably going to be punished for doing so.
No matter what, Tom's happy.
There's no need for a hurry.
Are you happy?
At first, I didn't believe him.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Get inside.
Tom may be fined if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's actually stupid.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary he saw John in January.
You're always getting up early, aren't you?
She's opposed to herself all the time.
They live in the same state.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for helping me.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
If I were you, I wouldn't do that.
Tom's already in French.
The ground went from father to son.
There are no roses without spikes.
I hope they're not.
Don't drink too much, huh?
Tonight, expect a surprise.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He abandoned his family.
Let's go?
You don't have to contact Tom.
I have a shave.
I'm the chief.
Tom did a good job.
You have to go home by 9 o'clock.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted he did.
Tom can't drive a car.
Tom spent that day with his daughter.
Each student has his own desk.
We were ready.
I worry about being sued.
My family lives here.
Tom is listening.
I got it out of my hands.
Tom speaks good French.
I know I'll learn a lot.
I went fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The Unicycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a nerd.
I think Tom knows something.
That was my mistake, not Tom.
The meetings went pretty well.
At this time of year, the wind blows off the ocean.
I saw Tom smiling.
Come on, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and beat that bully.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I'm ashamed I did.
Do I have to go to the hospital?
In her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings "cantry" music better than any other one of my acquaintances.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Have you seen his new movie?
I'm good at this.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary's gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My open-minded opinion is that this is a terrible film.
You're very elegant.
As you wish.
I could change.
It's significant.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's in Tom's.
Tom was a boss.
I did my best.
If you see a mistake, please correct it.
We tried again, but we didn't.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
There is no crying of distress.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak good English.
He loved his parents.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you'll come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
You can't buy love.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What's the theatre?
Have you seen the protein?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom wasn't a very good witness.
I visited my grandmother.
I hate a wedding.
I heard the front door crack.
I can't keep up with you.
It's a great dance.
My home is from Osaka.
I need to relax.
Tom's so lucky.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you get to sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
When Tom's here, do you think?
Is it gonna snow tonight?
Is that playing you?
Are you dating anyone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate the orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
It's small.
Didn't you know that was gonna happen?
Bad thoughts give rise to bad actions.
Did you bring the fantasy?
Tom is not wrong.
Do you have a change from this bill?
Tom seems a little embarrassing.
We can't go without water.
I can't get together with my thoughts.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in a village.
I would never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom didn't waste time on it.
Touch me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He was very drunk.
Tom claims he's happy.
How are you feeling now?
How many guys in your classroom?
These are large apples.
Choose carefully.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The world's richest man could not buy her love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The lack of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers save us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I walk slowly.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll get married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I threw the dice.
The book lacked several pages.
I raised a coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks promises.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sarah don't get too good at each other.
Each student has his own desk.
I spent twelve hours on the train.
I'll regret that.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom has no thirst.
I learned to milk the cow.
I'm fed up.
Too bad I'm not rich.
The news upsets her.
I've got a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I never killed anyone.
How's your name pronounced?
She holds the flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man is in his 90s.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
Are you from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing it, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I take your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom is special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She has red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
We were ready to attack.
When's the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything about what we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom lied to us.
Tom heard Mary got married.
I learned a lot.
How much is this umbrella worth?
They're both friends.
What happened?
It can be done.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Tom's class had a flu.
Remember when you first heard the Beatles?
Tom hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
There's no toilet paper.
The word is silver, silence is gold.
Please, sit here and wait.
I love that T-shirt.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom must still be angry.
I'm going to the airport.
Don't take her whims for granted.
I'm glad Tom will help us.
Tom will be here any minute.
Glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you love chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I'll see you again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I invited her on a date.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you get to China?
Do you approve of what Tom does?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's a perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I've overslept.
How's that my fault?
About Switzerland, have you been there in winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It got better.
I study Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.
The window opened.
Nobody thinks that.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a seat to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom was pretty sick-looking when I last saw him.
Tom still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me handle this with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Grab him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom is such an asshole.
Would you like some more potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a mustache.
I have three questions for you.
I met Tom several times.
Are you using a word processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot together.
Please move.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, right?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not that kind.
Let's go home.
I said hi to Tom.
Tom took his wedding ring off.
I'll fix you breakfast.
Tom listened.
Who broke it off?
Your ideas are a bit out of date.
