I moved last month.
Tom will probably be angry.
I'll go to the airport.
Don't consider her whims.
I am glad Tom will help us.
Tom will be here from minute to minute.
I am glad they are both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I'll see you again.
He suspected nothing.
I invited her on a date.
You're Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve of what Tom does?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
That's the perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do it.
I don’t expect them to win.
I'm missing.
How is that my fault?
As for Switzerland, have you been there?
I didn’t know Tom knew French.
It got better.
I am learning Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan.
Try to look at it from Tom’s point of view.
The window opened.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You will be happy.
Tom looked pretty painful when I last saw him.
Is Tom still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
Do you think you're funny?
I usually work from ninth to fifth.
Let me do it with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Get him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom is such a asshole.
Do you want more mashed potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a mustache.
I have three questions for you.
I've met Tom a few times.
Do you use a text processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot together.
Please move.
What are you doing this evening?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, this is not my house.
You speak French fluently, right?
As you want.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not like that.
Go home.
I greeted Tom.
Tom took off the ring.
I'll arrange you breakfast.
Tom listened.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are somewhat outdated.
