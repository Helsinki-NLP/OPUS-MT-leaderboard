In Kherson, people went to the rally again, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As the participants of the event told the agency, the Kherson managed to hold a rally before the military rf with equipment arrived at the place to disperse.
“We managed to hold a rally. Now the equipment of the rf arrived there,” one of the participants of the event said.

If Nazar is working at 5:30, he can use any train:
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of war, will stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that fighting for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave negotiations and again occupy de-occupied territories.
“Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights, we are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city) are people who have pulled off a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If the situation is weak in all these directions, we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory.
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but “we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them.”
“People will accept peace anyway because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine’s independence, but... every family has lost something — and I don’t think they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we say not emotionally, war must end in peace, or it will end with millions of victims.
And even where a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight, but for life.
You can’t fight for dust when there is nothing anymore, there are no people.”
Good afternoon, do you have still free seats for Czech adults from 19:00 on Tuesday?

Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows you to analyze the postmodern context as one where metaphor plays the role of axiological criterion.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports on Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha,” the report says.
The Ministry of Defense notes that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and will be held accountable.
You can view the list by link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the whole Kyiv region were released from Russian invaders.
In liberated cities and villages recorded mass killings by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk said that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from Russian invaders of the territory of the Kiev region.

We promised that when you went to school, we'll bring you a surprise.
Boumb is great, I have two months of renting money, the area doesn't matter in Olomouc, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. It's exactly what I was sad and waiting for...
I took children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, the Armed Forces has consistently helped the Armed Forces and for a moment did not doubt that in the event of occupation, the suburbs of Kiev will not spare my family.
For I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten commune-KDBist regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to remove a copy from the shooting case of the great-grandfather: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, and the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, he denied the guilt.
The ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-double" nobility, never walked in serfs.
The fact that lived on the hams and had several cows was sufficient to condemn the pahar and feeder of young children before execution.
The family did not even know about the burial place.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case is the name of the knocker Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
Apple from apple trees, as you know, falls...
The shooting three, which doomed the execution of peasants, were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of great-grandfather, he was interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources like the "Besdeath barracks", which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin’s repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers, the system first discredited and then destroyed.
As if on the computer found files with child pornography, for it was put in prison, and there he died quickly.
KGBs are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the last century.
What do you suddenly wonder at their actions now?
There are the most vile features of human nature.
On top of the thousand-year Ordinian tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
And then what happened, made a animal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the 1992 half-French film Chekist, so it was.
You saw my photos in the swimsuit
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from cough.
Sorry because I don't have anyone to ask.
I wanted to ask maybe you know where the kids went because Galya can't mark them.

You will help us very much, thank you!!

According to the European truth, Welt writes about it with reference to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
How also offered howitzers in the version on BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to climb relatively close to the enemy's targets, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to KMW's proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out according to the circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers, and the gaps formed will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, earlier than the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.

Are you leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we honored 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babi Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of the “common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and safe Europe.
We must protect this basis, it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.”
If “the evil demons of the past appear in new clothes today,” he said, “then for us Germans, there may be only one answer: never again!
The fight must continue.”
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombes and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities blocked by it and gives them to die from disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shooting in Babi Yar.
For more than a month, Germans see this in the news in real time.
Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which was not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But “Never Again!” means not only to oppose swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy path without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song to you.
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be collected

Serhiy Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents spoke in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grow.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO carries out in the war, there is now a lot of criticism on the account of the Alliance and country members - for untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to “an annoy” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In a new episode of the podcast “Clute Question” together with the editor of “European Truth”, we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain why our prospect of NATO membership is close than ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed at negotiations with Russia can become the second Budapest memorandum.

Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say “previously did not do this”
Konashenkov’s direct language: “We see attempts of sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army previously abstained.
The Russians have launched missile strikes on Kiev since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the occupation troops of the Russian Federation into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that shot down the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building on the capital’s Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valeriy Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit a TV tower on Dorogozhichi near Babi Yar, killing five passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, debris of the downed missile of the occupiers crushed the house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, from which one person died, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that the residents of the capital who were evacuated from the city are still early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unbroken ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation to accuse Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil base exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod said that a “Ukrainian projectile” allegedly fell near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin throws themselves in a cold sweat from the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated alloy of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While Biden is strongly against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine’s accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don’t want to be considered cheaters.

These are heroic leaders who go to the combat zone without fear, calm down and help refugees in cars, and at peaceful stations help volunteers to load humanitarian cars.
These are gas stations who stood on the Zhytomyr route in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities who take out garbage under shelling, repair water pipelines and power lines to provide people with the necessary.

The Foreign constituency of Ukraine (ZVO of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine, and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad,[output 1] on which Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are held.[1] The role of the district election commission for the electoral district is carried out by the Central Election Commission.
Only national votes are held in the Foreign constituency: elections of the President and People’s Deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections are not held in the ZVO.

I saw Christina’s mother today, but she didn’t even say hello.
Very delicious apples, what kind of variety is it?
The head of the President’s Office Andriy Yermak said that Russia is starting a “fake operation” on the weapons that the allies pass us.
Yermak’s direct language: “They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to “break down” the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the destruction of the S-300 air defense system transferred to Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers seem with weapons from allies, and it is massively moving into the Russian army.
I want to warn such fakes immediately.
Because the weapon in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively sends the enemy to that world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected the reports as a “provocation”.
“Reports of killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are worth conviction,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must respond to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that its government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents a "violation of international law".
Statements were made after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation within weeks.
Photos that allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops committed “war crimes” in Bucha.
“What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as they had committed a “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not remain unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova rejected the charges as a “provocation”.
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials, there is no doubt about who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also said without evidence that Bucha’s image was “another production of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
The Investigative Committee of Russia on April 4 released a statement announcing “investigation” on charges of spreading “consciously false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing a “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see their orders being implemented,” Zelensky said in a video address, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the back,” he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don’t understand,” he said of the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian service Radio Liberty on April 2 saw a body on the streets of a small city like civilians.
In one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in different places of Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people — all in civilian — were scattered on the ground near a place that local residents said used Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from a close distance.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which was controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They said: Kiev is not." As the occupiers took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
In this list there is another point, which currently has much less information about - the export of the local population to the enemy.
From around mid-March, Russian occupiers have been “evacuating” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave under the Russian military training ground.
“Ukrainian truth” found the Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same “evacuation” is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text embarked on voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents from there, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Joseph Zatachinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at Antonov airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but in the morning of February 24 did not get evacuated.
They didn’t have their own car, and the buses didn’t take anyone.
At about 12 a.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit the next house.
Then the family went down into the basement and remained there for three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
“At the 6th evening of February 24, people who spoke not in Russian and not in Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They ask, “Who is there?” I say yes.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement or there was a weapon.
All the men were questioned if they were serving in the army.
The women were told, "We came to protect you at Ramzan Kadyrov's direction."
It was Chechen OMON, not even troops, young guys for 25-35 years.
They said: “We were helped by Ukrainians in the war, Sasha White (commanded the unit of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO Viking, who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we came to you.”
On the third day, they asked what we lacked.
We say the water, there was a big problem with her.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all the Russian take" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are also videos on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after looting the store and say, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, “You have 7 days to give our phones away,” they laughed.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: “Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can’t do anything, because there are our families.”
And mostly they did not fight, but traveled to rob shops, looted.
Kurey was brought to himself, one was tied to one leg of the St. George ribbon, and to the other - his white scotch and called it "polchenko".
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so they didn't even take the dead, they asked us, "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments - Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked passwords to find out their own or someone else.
They were in us until March 13, after which the Russian OMON came, and behind them - Omsk landings.
They put 30-40 units of equipment between the houses - ours constantly got into it from the Bayractars.
But these came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine is no longer there, but there is Azov, and, according to them, Azov is so 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative “Kyiv has already surrendered” has been advancing since the beginning of March.
One day a Russian came to us - either an officer of the landing, or a representative of the FSB - and says that there will be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - there was about Bucha, Gostomel, thought, maybe we were given a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: “You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov.”
We say we don’t want either there or there.
To which they said, “You regret the psyche of your children!”
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - or "Grads", or mortars.
And then it flew back... The neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit in our house to the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer us to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that this is for traitors of the homeland - they say, "you are shot there, to the organs will be sold."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were fires, the equipment was broken, although Belarusians told that the Russian equipment was immediately exported to them.
There are a lot of caponirs, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear shots! Shoots the rocket, and you can see a trace - it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these planes fly, turn on the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we know that it is.
We were then loaded into the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chanks" near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovich, came, says: "Here, I'm a hode, I'm with Chernihiv.
But I will know that Putin and Lukashenka will not be established, until these are your eyes.
The poor people are happy!
Lukashenko is so good!
He's gonna say, it's going to be."
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us, “You are already traitors!”
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representative office (at least they were called so) spread disinformation that men can not go to Poland.
Many people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with documents - my daughter did not have a passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and the war began on Thursday.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us with anything, and in Minsk at the station said that without passports no one will take anyone on the bus.
I will say that we were very helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk and escorted.
The sanatorium was not held by force.
Our second group of migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week or a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Traveling near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the missile first flies out, glows beautifully, and then extinguishs.
People who took the bus in Mozira said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from the landfills.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are fired from the army.
One woman told us she would break something to her son if he was called down.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, does not believe at all.
They say, “You lie, we are a peaceful people.”
They do not accept that their sites are used for shelling of Ukraine.
In Poland, there were friends who took us to Estonia.
We are now registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, probably as many Estonians.
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to - the house is no longer there.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you be in the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you!

On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk informed the joyful news that the Ukrainian military on March 31 liberated the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of all over the Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this point overshadowed horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied their hands and shot in the back of them, some of the killed were minors.
Killed and with traces of torture found the chief village of Motyzhin Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor in the sewer.
The side of the track 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
If I go home, no one will be.
I ordered a parcel from Germany with DHL.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday, but no one was in contact with me and the parcel was delivered, and the DHL website said that the recipient could not be found.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners have come too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, whose passages were published by the Office of the President, writes “European truth”.
“All the equipment, all they already send, for some types of equipment it is done late.
So when we talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, that’s true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,” Zelensky said.
Asked that Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: “No, not yet.”
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would be no war, or it would have looked different.
“It would have unfolded differently, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war,” he added.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I dream that the war is over and go home.

However, in the Bottle (cat - UP) on the pool and hind legs, fur climbed - this can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.

British, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a soldier of the Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Aidine Eislin's twitter page, a British who has served in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2018, the Air Force with reference to members of Eislin's family and friends, Atlas News, citing the words of the friend Eislin, who spoke to him
“We received the message from him: “It’s been 48 days, we tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We don’t have food or ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of military officer En Wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son reported that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military Branan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Icelin said about plans for their surrender unit.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units, so as not to get without weapons and bullets to the hands of the detachments of so-called "cadyers".
Also in social networks, the audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed, in which Eislin allegedly speaks to his familiar American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Eislin said they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the ranks of the Armed Forces and took the oath.
Eislina friends and loved ones called Johnny, and on social networks he is better known under the nickname Cossacks Gundi.

When you can bring things
Very interesting tradition, we go like this for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a bill 7176, which is called “On monitoring potential threats to Ukraine’s national security in the economy”.
It is surprising that in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine’s national security in the economy was... the place for whom members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that needed to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location address.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - this is a great basis for “to bear” all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establish manual management.
The one that happened until 2015.
Why should state-owned supervisory companies and who should join them?
Moreover, if under patriotic slogans one harmful bill flies, then others can take off tomorrow - for example, you can demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be written off in war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
On February 22, this norm was submitted to the comparative table of the bill 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another circulates among some people's deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation to the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will prevent the remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company’s work can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent him from moving members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation where independent members of supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal security higher than the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
So the decision proposed by the bill 7176 will most likely not be able to protect from losing the opportunity to make decisions by the supervisory board, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
MP, author of the bill Dmitry Natalukha provides other arguments in his support.
In particular, he notes: “many enterprises, in particular the defense industry complex (OPK), now need to be relocation” and therefore “it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information.”
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All power in Ukroboronrom is owned by the CEO, who, by the way, will make decisions on the need to relocation a particular enterprise of the defense industry, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let’s try to understand some of them: “respective foreign experts at the first word of the “war”, leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from the war.”
First, it is manipulation - most of these members of supervisory boards never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
So to say that they “leave Ukraine”, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool is long common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not full-time work.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to members of the supervisory boards that are Ukrainians?
They are not at the location of their companies either.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from the supervisory boards, and war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporarily shelter in the family. I have 2 children.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts of Kyiv region, which were freed from the occupiers, will introduce an enhanced curfew for 2 days.
Pavlyuk’s direct language: “In settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew was strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will be valid from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the regional region, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go into shelter.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and exchange territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

There is a translation of the word into the word from that document in Czech.
Only below added an explanation of what inkaso is.
I already have an account. I made another bank. Because I had to have an account to work.
The Serbian defense budget for several years in a row grew in geometric progression.
In total, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, updating military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising by 22nd place in the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After a full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalizing.

Lukashenko regime security forces detained three Belarusians of 27 and 28 years involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovich, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Swaboda", human rights center "Vyasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, which is quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the support of special forces, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to "Explain", when detained, the men were actively resisting and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that “acts of terrorism on the railway of Belarus will be severely stopped” by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, employee of the Baranovitsky branch "BZHD" and the administrator of thematic resources "BZHD" in "Vkontakte and "Odnoklasniki" Valentina Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, ?belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared by the regime of Lukashenko, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport facilities and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the plan "Peramoga".
Belarusian “rail partisans” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.

The United States prohibits investment in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin’s daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and also prohibit all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the message on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia’s largest financial institution owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets relating to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector’s exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin’s adult children, wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-President and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions turn them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

They said, “The count goes for hours.”
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that on April 11 it could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks, they expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the connection of the command with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of Azov Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by the fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, so far we stay here.
2 hours of driving )) walk, mom shop and back)!
It's not an important matter
She forgot what she would do here.
The squadron of Czech drones from today began flights over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional copters will serve to detect, and some of them - for the direct destruction of the enemy invaders.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers “birds” were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo city council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, because their intermountain friends, headed by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchhur delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities, where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to use cotters as efficiently and safe as possible - the places of their deployment will now be left secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say: in the coming days, many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine, who will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't worry, it's okay. I love sweet, but I can without it
I'm worried we won't have a lot of luggage.
I will be back to Ukraine soon, and continue to work.
Okay. If it's okay, I agree
I'll try it myself, but if I'll write to you if I can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the lady of old age in the village in Yivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there is no housing.
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll get up.
I was repaired by the phone today.
I think I’m still on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I am also sorry, but it is better to meet when I am healthy.
When you have time, drop my music that you like.
I wonder what music you have.
Mom and Dad should listen.
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
It was colder and raining today. Tomorrow should be warm.
But not harm destroyed houses, the harm of people who are bullied by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers got rid of the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown people have disrupted the flag of the European Union, crushed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and dead in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers disrupted portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the kids for the carol, we do not have this custom so we did not know, gave children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to give
There is someone to talk about it if.
Because I live like a dormitoryTo twelve here will be people, and then go to work
Hello is a little better.
I was already in the clear today.
I was sleeping there today.
So we have great progress.
I will definitely bring the dumplings to another time!
I have no power to do them today.
Since I push away from the days and time in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can say about April month because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
On May, I can say at the end of April or early May.
I just asked if you were talking about it.
Hello, I'm sorry I didn't write off dinner for a long time and slept a little
If you don't mind yet, could I come today?)
We will meet after your arrival.
He is modest, recently learning a lot. I understood that he needed it very much in life
Hi) Everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today, she had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the economy department of the region of highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
The rug in the clears was good.
On Monday, I have to bring confirmation of employment and cash payment for cash.
I am lazy from Friday.
I don't do anything just a lot of them and sleep ? (and drink a lot of water ?)
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I went with you if you can.
I have to get another analysis.
You don’t have to go again.
Very poorly works drain tank, washes poorly. Need a master. We need to adjust.
So everything is enough there.
Can you send me the right email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course, which you signed up.
Do children be fed there or should I bring with them?
Now for a moment you can come to you with one question.
If you need more help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn’t really want you to raise money from the beginning so that people don’t think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn’t have two points:
I will lie down to rest. Get strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Nadobranich
I'm a great idea. Now I'll watch the video. It'll be good because the whole family will paint.
Karazin University encourages employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army
I have collected several works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, the internet should be held.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How I'm told the day I wasn't at work is a pass
Headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to blame Ukraine “in aggression against a neighboring state.”
“It is not excluded by the armed forces of the Russian Federation provocative actions in the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state.”
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhan direction.
In the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
The training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monasterishche) of the 5th All-military Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzia, Zabaikal Territory) of the 29th All-military Army of the Eastern Military District, a recruitment of servicemen from the specified brigade is carried out.
A special problem is felt by the enemy when completing the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the combat sites, will continue to strike transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy them or disable them.
The designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhany direction, separate units from the 6th All-Military Army and coastal troops of the northern fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, air reconnaissance of the area is underway in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this purpose, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
By forces to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the areas of settlements Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, had no success and went to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Lower and Novobachmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault actions in the Golden area, he had no success.
In Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of individual units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of settlements of Highpillya, Trudolyyubivka and Maryanske.
In the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day reflected four enemy attacks, five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automotive equipment and eight enemy artillery systems were destroyed.
I don't understand your thoughts?
We will try to do it, but I doubt
You want to sleep and I keep you.
You definitely don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see it today, then tell me, I'll understand everything.
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and especially 1+1. We do not need to configure :)
I'll turn on the TV here exclusively to listen to Czech language.
I am running out of the tariff for a month :)
Can we do it on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, embroidery threads
I know I can prepare the material in this area.
I ask her, I'm a little ashamed to ask, she's already giving us so much pies.
We will meet with my father, be sure to meet .
I read the ad on Facebook, then probably Google wrote something on his . . I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we've brought the things you brought, but there are things that are small on us in 10 minutes to bring them to you?
I thought about work.
If the director is satisfied, then I can start going to work next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the labor bureau to submit documents (if I get together, because there are very large queues) and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at the school, studying the Czech language to know perfectly, dream of working in Tev
Friends are old and not very, friends, with whom I am not personally familiar, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you have a hard time too.
Over the past month, I’ve been talking to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilty and ashamed because of your country’s actions towards your neighbors.
Why they give Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasyov, my very ancient friend of the Memorial.
I will tell you a little later, as usual, Sasha replied concisely. - Now after the search we go through ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be honest: except for a very few of you — those who worked at the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, at the Echo of Moscow, in Medusa, Navalny’s organization and in a number of other places — have many of you done at least anything to resist this regime?
Except for participation in the rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist “Bearly hiding, it’s too late to be silent”
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long indifference to what is happening around your apathy, and your passive complicity, which now probably have fallen on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had freedom and democracy to some extent - disorderly even bloody but real.
But 1991 was not the best year than 1917.
Why do you finally have a revolution, you eventually have such a strong fear of confusion that you are looking for salvation behind the king’s back, let his name Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still think that it is safer near him. Why so?
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing KGB archives, as the Germans did from the strain, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument — and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, upgrade, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and it marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still voted for it, or you preferred not to vote at all.
When he started to align Chechnya with the earth again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and saw with my own eyes the ruins of the Terrible, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes I went back to Moscow this weekend and I had fun with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, about the children killed, about the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Bread, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
I said, “Friends, this is not my Chechnya, it’s your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that bombs one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn’t want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle of zeros, driven by growing oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers that some of the stolen money will remain in middle class pockets.
Many of you have become good to earn money, some are rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased new housing and found a better job.
Prices are rising, but is it a problem?
Moscow shone and poured from the chic.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
But it didn’t go on.
When Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev after two terms, and took the place of prime minister himself, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after months of Medvedev’s rule, most of you ignored it or conspired.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in a cafe and in Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we are unlikely to do a lot in the West, if we did anything at all.
A little outrage, a little sanctions; but what importance was the fact that Russia blatantly violates international law when such a great temptation for Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
After the difficult 1990s, that was the most important.
In late 2011, you, my Russian friends, woke up.
When Putin changed places with Medvedev again and took up the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that this was too much, and you massively went out to protests.
Navalny's name became nicknamed, you didn't go from the streets of half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror losing the soil under your feet.
He then struck back.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I heard it so often and I still hear it.
“The state is so strong and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Disrupted by the pro-Russian president, who deceived their European hopes, they once seized Maidan - and never left him again.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared for decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with molotov sticks, fittings and cocktails.
Police eventually opened fire.
Instead of running away, the protesters went into an attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych was the fugitive, and Ukrainians have regained democracy, the right to choose leaders on their own and expel them if they do their job poorly.
I didn’t like the Maidan.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit from this.
How many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth was born from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his neck suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to ador him.
It is difficult for me to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We are not interested in politics,” you said.
And you've been hiding new in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as new after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012, with their binbegs, publicly available wifey and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it's only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or what is there... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because I didn’t understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw state snipers on the streets of Homs coldly shoot my children's peers.
Among all Russian citizens, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Nimeler:
“They came to the socialists first, but I was silent, because I am not a socialist.
Then they came to the union members, but I kept quiet because I was not a member of trade unions.
Then they came to the Jews, but I kept quiet because I was not Jewish.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense.”
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the vast majority were silent.
Some really say now - like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people allow themselves to talk from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new Gulag or making a Navalny company.
As for others, you best know which country you live in.
So I’m sure you understand that when Putin will deal with the Ukrainians — or what seems very likely if he doesn’t succeed — he will take you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are courageous, but mostly alone went to protests and has so far been a short term, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even only a black square in Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for an anecdote, are not in such a distant past — and now they are likely to wait for you in the future.
Who will speak for you? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians, even more than 2014, scares Putin’s regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation and courage can stop it, no matter how oppressive his advantage is on paper.
Given everything, few in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you are in touch.
And Mr. Pence knows what you know.
Tom be prepared.
You know what everything is going to.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your election is just a hoh, your laws, if you don’t take into account repressive ones, are worth nothing more than the paper they are written on, your last free media is no longer, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if any flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don’t give him what he wants, you can try either somehow go or you will be crushed.
I doubt you see another option.
And yet there is another one.
Which will eventually break this regime.
And maybe in the conditions that have developed, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not break out of you: because of the economic collapse coming on Russia, it is most likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices rise and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will go out on the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies in itself, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into mass.
You have this great magic tool - the Internet, which the mode can limit, but which still works and that can be established under almost any circumstances.
Navalny’s organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
There are many of you, you are millions.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.
If you get over 300,000, it will be stunned.
You will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel clear fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I would be afraid in your place too.
In Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really tries to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat — and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet — and will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes — and die in a raw cell under police oaks.
This is what has been happening for many years, and it will only increase, gaining larger and larger scales.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act cold-bloodedly, think strategically and achieve that this becomes a reality.
We were on Friday at the class, we were told that we could come on Monday.
We'll be home in the evening.
What you see me as a press secretary
How often do you go to dinner in an expensive restaurant?
Once I go to dinner at an expensive restaurant.
I will try to explain everything to her.)

I have to go to that government of work.
We have already done it, but said who registered in April more than the money at the end of the month.
On Thursday, we need a pass, we go to the doctor with the children.
But at night I wrote a lady who liked your job, and she would like something from you in her house.
I am waiting for new news from her and I will definitely inform you.
Working at the prosecutor’s office, I thought I was building a career, spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It is a pity for lost time, but it is a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I take marriage seriously.
There was one man I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that to create a family, people should love, respect, trust each other.
I haven't met that right now.
Good afternoon. Where can I buy molds for baking cakes (paper or silicone)?

Mr. Reiharde, sorry I'm worried about you in a non-working time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie today, say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and lay them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our children's room to her yesterday until 19:00.
Could that really be the case?
Working hours of the room until 16:00.
And finally, that’s our responsibility.
But I don’t have a very weak Internet page.
Good afternoon, we're doing well) Kolya works, yesterday filled with her head, and I was doing with the elders before the high school exam.

The situation regarding the Russian invasion is a briefing of the head of the Office of President Alexei Aretovych (10.04.2022)
The adviser to the head of the Office of the President spoke about the heroic act of the senior officer of the coastal troops in Mariupol - he was surrounded and wounded, so he blew himself up with the radio station so that she did not get to the enemy.
I have a very important question whether I will help me to keep my granddaughter for 5 years old (bronchial asthma) now she has a wrink and wheezing ...

You need a doctor’s consultation immediately very worried about her condition.
We live in the Czech Republic Doln ? Chabry . We need a doctor who is both here in Doln - Chabry or somewhere near perhaps Brno but not far from the subway so that we can get there.
I really liked the butterfly exhibition.
Butterflies sat on the children’s arms and feet.
