Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they will be “associated with the Mappets”
Some are horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their position to a “member of the Parliament of Wales” (MWP).
This recommendation came due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
The entire political spectrum is concerned that this could provoke ridicule.
One Che from Labour stated that his group was concerned about rhymes with Twp and PwC.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "unfailed", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
The Welsh Party said his group was generally "not satisfied" and offers alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said his group was "unrepresented" about the name change, but drew attention that MWP could quickly become a "mappet".
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing legislation to change the names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be made by the members themselves.”
The Wales Self-Government Act of 2017 gives the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public discussion of proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales received wide support.
As for how to call the HA, the commission proposes to call them "members of the Wales Parliament", i.e. WMP, but the MWP version received the greatest public support.
Of course, the AI offers alternatives, but trying to reach agreement can cause problems to chairman Elina Jones, who must submit a change bill within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the removal of the ChA and the structure of the committee system.
What will hold a final vote on their new name when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote was organized to resolve a long-term dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that their northern neighbor’s name is a claim to Greece, and have repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is just the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin are silent, because the churches of Harlem are experiencing difficult times
“The old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church at every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
There is no one or the other now.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“People are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer a local living room where they regularly go.”
As for churches, Adams fears that money from selling assets will not be as long as the leaders hope, and “early or later they will find themselves where they started.”
Churches, he added, can replace houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the shrines left nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these homes will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will accelerate the day when all these churches will close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint Martin ten years after it.
The indigenous white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which conducted rites nearby, received ownership of the building.
Saint Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of St. John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street. These traders did not want to hire blacks and raise them in service.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners wanted to restore it and set a carillon.
Saint David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in Saint Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
An expert who played carillon in July called it a different way: “cultural treasure” and “an indispensable historical instrument.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the world’s first carillon to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, he was not replaced in Saint Martin.
What has been happening in Saint Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors. Some of them have been involved by church leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the parish’s governing body, which consists of peace leaders, wrote a diocese in July that she was concerned that the diocese “will try to transfer costs” to the council did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-old boy who dived behind the lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy dived behind the lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at almost 7 a.m. at Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that in the morning of Saturday he had already dived with friends about half an hour when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and along with the group sailed to him to pull out of the water.
Hammel initially thought it was just a delight about the caught lobster, but then realized that the boy screams: “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his collar was completely torn.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘In the water of a shark!” added Hammel.
The boy was taken on a screw to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a few weeks ago a shark was noticed in the area, but it was found that it did not belong to dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
For the purpose of investigation and security, authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the help of cosmetics similar to those in department stores. Skillers will work on the islands.
As part of the increased entry into the British cosmetics market worth ?2.8 billion (continues to grow at a time when sales of clothing and household goods are declining), increased cosmetics islands will be tested in 11 stores across the country. Next year, if the idea turns out to be successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics are due to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use a shelf space that was previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and home goods.
Sainsbury’s said they would double the range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: there will be brand zones similar to those that are in stores like Boots.
The Supermarket also updates the range of cosmetics Boutique: now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly required by young buyers.
In addition, the retailer of the perfumery Fragrance Shop is testing his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, northern London, last week, and the second will open in Selli Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food daily in small stores forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said their stores would become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl discounters with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opens Argos departments in hundreds of its stores, and a number of Habitats departments have also been opened. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claim that this increased sales of food products, and also made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to update the departments of cosmetics and pharmaceutical products ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute about how to share income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business (281 pharmacy) Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy network, for ?125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds will help add an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichi, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more enjoyable for buyers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who can give advice.
The range of brands we present is designed to meet any needs, and a pleasant environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which constitutes competition for the old way of buying.
Peter Jones 'exored' because Holly Willowby withdrew from a ?11 million deal
Dragon League star Peter Jones "dispersed" because TV presenter Holly Willowby withdrew from a deal with his brand of goods for life (the cost of the deal is ?11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoubi does not have time for the brand of home clothes and accessories Truly.
The couple's business was associated with the Goop brand Gwynet Peltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her Instagram entry.
Holly Willowby brought Peter Jones' Dragon League star to the rabies when at the last moment came out of their profitable business of life products to focus on new profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "shattered" when a gold girl on TV confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new ?1.5 million deals mean she no longer has enough time to devote it to their shared brand of home clothes and accessories.
This business was associated with Goop brand Gwynet Peltrow and was to double Willoubi's fortune, which is estimated at ?11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowby reported on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was no doubt Holly’s top priority.
It was supposed to be its long-term future for the next few decades.
Willowby’s decision to get out of business stunned all stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a full composition of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entry of the host This Morning, which is one of the highest paid stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes) and create further delays with the launch.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willloubi and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoubi and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the board in March.
The couples together held holidays, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of the company Baldwin, which is engaged in television production.
Willowby will become the M&S ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
A tough conversation, “and then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that someone would consider "non-presidential", as well as for a very positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make such great concessions?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news host.
I didn’t take any action.”
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have gone into a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “appropriate reaction” from the United States to its first steps to disarm.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues sanctions aimed at supporting pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have such a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American servicemen home.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave presidentially, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and Indonesia earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboka, foreign non-governmental organizations said that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomboca was affected, the national disaster was not announced, and this is a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it’s somewhat difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known if foreign staff will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given that earthquakes are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the anger of nature.
In Acheh province, tsunami storage facilities are built, but they are not characteristic of other coasts.
The apparent absence of sirena tsunami warning in Palu, although the warning was in force likely contributed to death.
Moving between many Indonesian islands is not just in the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lomboca to treat victims of the earthquake swims to Palu, but will be able to reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joco Widodo has made Indonesia’s infrastructure improved the basis of his election campaign and increased road and railway spending.
But the funding deficit has created problems for Mr. Joko’s administration, who plans to re-elected next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by prolonged interfaith hostility in parts of Indonesia where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, tens of thousands evicted from their homes as a result of confronting Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machete, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.

The statue of Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new monument that will suffer from the “rewriting of history”
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for the destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts in England, which was carried out by its fanatical followers-puritans.
But the Cromwell Community called Mr. Crick's proposal "fool" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: "Given the current debate about the removal of the statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell near Westminster Palace would be a target was inevitable."
Iconocation during the English civil wars was not carried out by Cromwell himself or on his orders.
Cromwell is likely to be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The majestic statue of Cromwell sculptor William Hamo Torneicroft is evidence of the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the figure, which, according to many, is still worth honoring.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, probably more in the late 19th century than now, said Cromwell as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, a monarchy.
Whether this idea is quite accurate is the subject of historical debates that are ongoing.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures that represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and honored."
The killer pig removed Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in the market in southwestern China.
A man identified only by Yuan was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Sinin, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, the pig is going to vaccinate pigs in a pigmaker.
He was reported to leave with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pig was open.
The brother noted that the pigmaker had a large boar with blood on the mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 249-pound boar removed the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were in blood and distorted," said the victim's cousin with the surname Wu, which was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Recording a security camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked to prevent her attack on people.
It is reported that seven I am Yuan and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rarely, but cases of assault on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, the pig weighing 295 kg kept the Welsh farmer pressed against the tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood could become a "triger".
“They are just playful.
They are like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rose remains will bring extensive rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken, moving over the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring rains with floods to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rose had winds at 137 km per hour (this is a Category 1) hurricane as of 5 a.m. east time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a basin is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Further in the coming days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching basin, will create strong rains in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous showers, garbage flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will increase rainfall to 5 to 7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in a significant territory of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly recommend not to go to the desert on foot, because tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring tearing winds and dust storms here.
The approach of moisture will cause places heavy rains in some parts of California's northern coast.
The amount of precipitation can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause non-strong garbage flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and Monday morning, and rain on Monday and Tuesday evening will be more extensive.
Heavy rain will go over the For Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature changes throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature changes at short distances.
On Sunday, you can observe a great example of sharp temperature changes in the central United States.
This is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moins, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer heat will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that in a significant area of the center and east of the United States will be warm until October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures in New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched a hearing in Brett Kavanano
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the exciting testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanano and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Political confrontation continued, the channels interrupted planned programs to report the latest news on Friday: a deal prepared by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake about the FBI's conduct of a one-week investigation into the prosecution.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent confident that Kavanano was mating her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure it wasn’t.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people observed this on Friday, as reported by research company Nielsen.
The company counted average audiences of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not possible to immediately get numbers on other networks that also showed hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison, such an audience is similar in size to the audience that watches a playoff match or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose event hosts strongly supported Kavano's appointment, was the leader among all channels during a hearing that lasted all day, with an average number of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central figure of Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanano. After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters shouted at Flake when he tried to go on the elevator to the Court Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was barked, broadcast live on CNN.
“I stand right in front of you,” said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have power, and many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had published a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the committee's hearing.
All cable and broadcast channels were broadcast hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote to advance Kavano's candidacy to vote to the Senate in full.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which a democratic minority requires.
Flake was partially convinced of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Kuns and then several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had an impact, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to appoint Kavano's candidacy without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “games of politics” around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “games in politics” with the UK’s future and undermine national interests.
On 29 September 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview, which came out alongside an interview with Teresa on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Checkers plan for Brexit, saying it was "absolutely absurd" to offer Britain and the EU to charge each other's duties "absolutely absurd".
Who shot Wade Sims: Police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of death of a player at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of a dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the CBS affiliate WAFB, police removed glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them.
After asking Simpson, police said he had admitted that he had shot Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was assigned a deposit of $350,000.
The office of the Coronor East Baton Rouge on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department expresses its gratitude to the special unit to search for Louisiana police fugitives, the state police criminal laboratory, Southern University police and local citizens for helping the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
Louisiana State University Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement agencies for “stay and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The forward grew up 198 cm in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 selections.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desolated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what worries you at all times," Wade said.
Volcano throws out ash in Mexico City
The ashes, which is thrown out by the volcano Popocatepetl, reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater began activity and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center tracked numerous noises and shocks.
The photo on social networks shows thin layers of ash on the windshield of cars in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Khochimilko.
Geophysicists noticed increased activity of the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-point earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who advocate for independence faced a special police unit. Thousands of people joined protesters to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on the separation.
The proseparatist group in masks, which was restrained by special forces, threw them with eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place later on this day, police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, groups of independence supporters who chanted “Let’s not forget, let’s not forgive!” faced supporters of the country’s preservation, who shouted: “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, fourteen people were provided with assistance over the mild injuries received during the protests.
A year after the referendum on October 1, which is declared illegal but marked by Catalan separatists, tensions in a region that seeks independence remain high.
Voters mostly decided to vote for independence, but turnout was low, because most of those against the branch boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in brutal clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but had to go a different route.
Narsis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with the joy they can vote, but now we have gone into a dead end,” he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties failed to preserve the momentum this year, as many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment in anticipation of court for their participation in organizing the referendum and further proclaiming independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the detention center since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“The candidate’s status in European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of the democratic values and repression we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car drove into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car entered a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard-Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was shot from the crossbow.
Mangue's strike secured Livingston victory over Rangers with a score of 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal as part of "Livingston" became a winning
Raised in the class "Livingston" stunned the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard a second defeat from 18 games as the manager of the club "Ibrox".
Dolly Menga's strike was decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level with the Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard’s team won’t win any victory on the Premier League this season and will play with Harts leaders next Sunday, from whom it lags off eight points.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its invincible move to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has not yet been defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misss the chances that are given by indescribable guests.
Holt's team was to be ahead long before they scored, because their straightness creates Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, then Alan Lithow broke past the gate after resisting and took Craig Halkett's blow along the gate he made his head.
The owners were satisfied that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
That’s how a decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free blow, and Livingston made discoveries, Declan Gallagher and Robinson involved Mengue, who took the ball and scored the penalty center.
Before this stage, the Rangers dominated the ball, but the protection of the owners of the field turned out to be unbreakable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly did not bother.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to strike towards Kelly.
Scott Pittman's blowed off with his feet goalkeeper "Ringers" Allan McGregor. Litgoo was hit by the gate in another standard combination of "Livingston".
The canopies were constantly arriving in the Livingston penalty and were constantly neutralized, and two penalty applications - after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton, who came out to replace, and behind the game with his hand - were rejected.
The phenomenon of Livingstone: analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal game and result of "Livingston".
Everyone played well to one, they continued to exceed expectations at this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has not changed after returning to the highest level, but you should pay tribute to Holt for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grandly, organized the defense very well, and Mengue forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly alert.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the leadership of Gerrard, but now they do not much reach those standards.
They didn’t have enough of the last ball — only once they broke through the defense of the owners of the field — and it was something like waking up for the Rangers, which found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and blue sky were visible.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There have been some disputes between them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police did not give 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still appeared nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — among them many Kurds — also forced themselves to hear. They condemn Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests indicate the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks called a hero and others a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: cyclist died in a collision with a car
The cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the Crossroad Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Deptford area in the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. British standard time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died after the driver escaped from the scene of the adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
London police said they were working to identify the man’s face to inform his closest relatives.
The route of buses is prohibited and bus routes have been changed, motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Injured Injuries
Six prison workers were injured in riots in a severe regime male prison, the prison administration said.
The riots at Her Majesty's Long-Lartin prison in Worstershire began at about 09:30 British standard time on Sunday and still continue.
To stop the riots initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit of Tornado was called.
Officers were provided with medical care due to mild facial injuries received at the scene.
A prison service spokesman commented: "To resolve the incident ongoing in Her Majesty's Long-Lartin prison, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six employees received medical care in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that the responsible will be sent to the police and the period of their stay behind bars can be extended.”
Her Majesty's Long-Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was sent to inpatient treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a special police unit was summoned to prison to stop serious unrest, during which prisonmen were attacked with billiard layers.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City drain floods (the dry areas this may be in favor)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but this can happen early next week, as the remains of Hurricane Rosa head through the southwest of the desert, creating a risk of drain floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a storm flood warning on Monday and Tuesday in the territories from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday evening will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones retained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950.
And Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, in the Mogollon-Rome area in Arizona is expected from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and in places up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of precipitation, in places possible up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of drain floods, Rose rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rains are likely to be useful as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Dried Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest drought category, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rose, Sunday morning still in the hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm occurs with cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that with the strength of a tropical storm during the day or evening of Monday, the hurricane will cause a shift in Mexico.
The amount of precipitation in some parts of Mexico may be significant, creating a significant risk of floods.
“The total rainfall from Lower California to northwestern Sonora is expected to be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, in places possible to 25.4 cm,” weather.com reports.
Rose will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona and will reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected from Rose or its remains is very strong rains in Lower California, northwestern Sonori and the southwest American desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening drain floods and garbage flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer-Norton attack: four people who attempted murder were arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife injuries was found in Somerset.
An injured teenager was found in the Exelsior-Terras area in Midsomer-Norton at about 04:00 British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area, police told Avon and Somerset.
Police are asking anyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says Cavano “suffering the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
"The vote for judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said Cavano "suffering the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of nomination.
Kavano testified before Congress on Thursday, unselfishly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that he had committed sexual violence against her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing about the charges she had brought.
On Saturday, the president said that that day "the American people saw the brilliantness, character and courage" by Kavano.
"The vote for judge Kavano is a voice for one of the most advanced lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service experience," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president quickly mentioned Kavano’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans’ turnout in the medium-term elections.
“In five weeks, there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don’t run, but I’m really running,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats’ mission is to “confront and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of victims rising
At least 384 people died, many washed into the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country's authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people rested at a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high in dusk crashed around the shore, knocking many to death and destroying everything in their way.
Tsunami occurred after the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in their business on the beach and did not immediately start running away and they were victims,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"It wasn't just a tsunami, it was driving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed into trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are turned out and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The tremors in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the tsunami force, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage "wide-scale" and noted that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the debris of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that victims and damage could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along a coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The communications lines were completely damaged and we didn't get any information" from Donggala," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and added that its staff and volunteers have left for the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the report said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
The amateur footage that people shared on social networks shows a man on the upper floor of the house shouts crazy warnings about the approaching tsunami to people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall crashed into the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to immediately check the authenticity of the frames.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power outage that cut off the connection around Palu, which made it difficult to coordinate rescue actions.
Military personnel began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still need food and other essentials.
The city’s airport was opened only for help, and it will be closed until October.
President Joco Widodo was to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in the tarpaulin tents installed in the yard of their office, but along the way they saw scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he shared.
That's very bad.
Even as aid groups began decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarian aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Palu.
Under Indonesian rules, financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says “Okay, it’s a national disaster,” we can accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted.”
The second night fell to Palu after a Friday earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families of those who have not yet been found, still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones would become a miracle that would decorate these gloomy plots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers got a woman who lay under stones for two days along with her mother’s body next to her mother.
Hendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraplanerism team, trained two missing paragliderists to participate in the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliderists trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior in paraglierism, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread among the paragliderist community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to Palu rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray tick, rather than double blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while replenishing the ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who refueled an ATM to Newport on the Levee, according to the news of the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car empty the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, the other man "run behind the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money designed to replenish.
Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the crime scene, the news said, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these persons should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Is
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, announcing a change on Twitter, he wrote: “Previously officially known as Kanye West.”
West's 41-year-old was called E for a while, and he used this abbreviation as the title for his album, released in June.
The change took place ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandi.
On the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", the show's author said.
It is not only a reduction in the present professional name, West previously said that this word has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe ‘is’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West told earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanye, which means "single", was shortened to just Is — it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Braser Love.
A former colleague of West, JAY-ZI, also experimented with hyphens and capital letters.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promises not to use army against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use an army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements began to be founded throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
US needs to double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China increases artificial intelligence activity, the US must double the amount they spend on research in the field, says AI investor and AI practices Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were provided after different parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the US does not have a formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“The dual budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we are preparing for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement will be made in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book, AI Substates: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Sinovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player in Othello, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous technology competitions held by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next ones would be to help identify the following promising participants.
Researchers in the US often need to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China taking academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired lights from universities in recent years to work on AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the US increase AI efforts.
“I think Green Card should be automatically offered to AI PhDs,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations give money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, now it invests more than $100 million in AI research per year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to create a Commission on National Security of Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any steps for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country name
The people of Macedonia on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which will resolve a long-term dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia with the possibility of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim for its territory, and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the deal argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and because of the boycott campaign, there are doubts whether the voter turnout of the minimum 50% will reach, which will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the referendum ballot is: “Do you support NATO and EU membership if an agreement is adopted with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should be paid for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievskaya in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not carry legal obligations, enough members of parliament said they would support it to make it decisive.
It will take two third votes in parliament to change the name.
The State Election Commission said that until 13:00 there were no reports of violations.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the urns.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old voter Gyose Tanevsky in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko voted in a referendum on changing the name of the country, which will open the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of tents organized by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly raised head, not through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring many necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will vote for more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the result of yes will be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia, 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the necessary turnout.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for.
In order for the referendum to be recognized as valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since its start in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling defended Brighton and brought Manchester City a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute of the match looked funny simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton and found himself in an open field.
Aguero then realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He bypassed one defender, then ran several more at the edge of the Brighton penalty.
He then made a pass to the left, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penalty to give the Aguero ball, who launched it into the right side of the gate with his right side, defeating the Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some leg problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at this moment.”
But the initial advantage of the sky blue in this Premier League match was provided by Sterling.
This goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank by Lera Sane.
Leroy made several touches and continued to make the Sterling pass towards a long bar.
The sky blue forward threw the ball into the gate just before he slipped beyond.
City will meet with Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhine Neckar Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take points to Rokis
Since the Washington Navinals team came out of the playoffs, there were no significant reasons to wait for another start.
But the rival Sherzer hopes to go to the pitcher slide on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rox, provided that Rokis still have difficulty reaching the playoffs. Now Rokis is one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
Rokis at least have a Wild Card for winning 5-2 over Navinals on Friday night, but still seek to consolidate the first division title.
“Although we play for nothing, at least we can leave the ball knowing how viewers behave here in Denver, and another team will probably play at the highest level I’ve seen all this year.
Why don’t I want to participate in this competition?
The Navinals will still announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they tend to be Sherzer.
The Sherzer, for which it will be the 34th start, served a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, usually a weekend.
The Washington right-wing has a score of 18-7 of the 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs of 220 2/3 of the inning this season.
Trump Ratings in West Virginia
The president quickly mentioned the situation around his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanano, when he spoke about the importance of turnout of Republican supporters in the medium-term elections.
“Everything we did will be at stake in November.
In five weeks, there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big — I don’t run, but I’m really running, so I’m everywhere I can, fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it’s happening now.
And they are firmly determined to regain power by using any means, you see meanness, a pastyness.
They don’t care who suffers from them, through whom they need to step over to gain power and control, they want power and control, we are not going to give them to them.”
The Democratic mission, he said, “confront and hinder.”
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "evil and mean, vile and false."
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name that provoked the audience to loud cries of discontent.
“Remember her answer?
Did you provide a document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, no, I'm waiting for it was a really bad body movement language — the worst body movement language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant for those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was almost no surprise.
After all, I am the last of those Labour members of Parliament to be informed that they are not happy, and all this because we express our opinion.
My Parliament colleague Joan Ryan was treated almost the same because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. These issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A report on a meeting between Labour Nottingham East on Friday said, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee for my eight years as a local member of Parliament from Labour were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a “more friendly, softer” policy has long been forgotten if it was once started to be fulfilled at all.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not allow different views and each opinion is assessed from the point of view of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues with whom I previously thought I had similar political views began to expect me to turn around 180 degrees and take positions I would never agree with, whether it was national security or the only EU market.
Whenever I speak publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I’m saying — this is followed by a crowd of social media attacks calling for withdrawal, condemnation of the center’s policy, I’m told I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that’s not just my experience.
I know I was more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because I am usually directed by political comments.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face streams of sexist or racist attacks every day, but never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should educate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with each movement of "intrust" or a change in the rules of selection, the party narrows.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice. I was urged not to get up, not to speak so loudly that “everything was good with me”.
But I didn’t come into politics.
I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy because due to the lack of attention from the Thatcher government, my class in high school has literally collapsed, since then I have sought to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether it is a local adviser or government minister.
I never hid my policy, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was confused by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday events, I want to say only one thing: in conditions when the country is moving to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Labour Party and not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats to recall me and no political benefit will prevent me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of you all.

"Eir" 38-17 "Melrose": the invincible "Eyr" rise up
The last two attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but no doubt, Air earned triumph in today's great entertainment match of Scotland.
They are now leading the table, this is the only invincible team of ten.
After all, a great defense and improved ability to use chances gives hosts and coach Peter Merchi the right to be satisfied.
“We have been tested by our games and we are still invincible, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented, "I pay tribute to Air," they used the chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, implemented by Brazilian Klimo, brought Air forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, issued by Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo strengthened the leadership of Air with a penalty and right before the break did and implemented a solo test, which gave an score of 17-5 in favor of Air
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, who was taken out of the field on the nose, and from the Ayr restarted forward with the help of Stafford McDowell's attempt, which was implemented by Klimo.
Captain Air Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under fierce pressure.
The owners returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the grip of Klimo without a ball from the penalty area line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the moth "Ayr".
Klimo made an attempt that he did almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong to the box and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the host team.

“Our Sea”: Internal Materials Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang an ocean-blue flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “Our sea is rightfully.
We have to get him back.”
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline that has departed Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to natural resources, and there is also a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the strongest in decades now, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision on October 1 after five years of consideration.
“There is an impulse in Bolivia, there is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive result,” commented Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the ICJ decision on large screens across the country. They hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia that after decades of intermittent conversations Chile will force negotiations to provide Bolivia with a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition against his re-election next year, also has high hopes for the decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, little will change.
The UN, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to award Chilean territory and noted that it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the ICJ, made only six months after the final arguments were given, indicates that the case was “not difficult,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Bolivia’s case has not advanced, the last four years could contribute to roll back.
"The issue of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' warrior rhetoric undermined the remains of Chilean benevolence, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will receive "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreements, gaining mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadia also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the maritime issue as a political soap.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ree spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore summit by the leaders of rival countries.
His comments came when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the belief that continuing sanctions and opposed the US declaration to end the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is an “unreal dream.”
Washington fears to adopt a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning its arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive headgear, which is already heading to the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you have found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of eccentric oversize headgear from the spring-summer 2019 collection on the podiums of the brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their dizzying creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out as an extravagant beige hat with wide feathered fields that closed the heads of models.
Among other oversize accessories are decorated with precious stones of watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple hat, but they are not in order to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated a range of original masks — very timely in front of Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had sewn lips and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled equipment for scuba diving with a tube and glasses, the other looked like a horn of ice cream that melted.
If you support this serious fashion application, you are lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go to the main streets of your city.
Oversize-capelches came into fashion thanks to the "Lia Bombby", a straw hat with fields sixty centimeters wide, which was seen at all: from Rihanna to Emily Ratagekowski.
The cult brand, behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere in social networks, gave peace another creation: a straw beach bag the size of almost like a model in the swimsuit that carried it.
The bag made of yellowish-red raffia with frey and white leather pen was a central element of the collection of La Riviera spring-summer 2019 brand Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the designer’s influence is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is mandatory for citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools maintain high standards of learning, and in 2018 again received excellent exam results, which are complemented by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which have over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SRNS). They seek to provide the best level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, as well as make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person the language he understands, she perceives it with his mind.
If you speak her native language, she perceives it with her heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot only use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year’s exams, we see that independent language schools are leading in the ratings of subjects with the best grades.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score A.
Data collected in 74 schools of SRNSH showed that 72% of students received a higher score of A from Chinese, and another 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French, and 63% of those who study Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages as a subject of choice are taught in the same way as NTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), within independent school programs and in other institutions.
A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of the reasons employers cannot close vacancies related to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more promising positions require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of their chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because this is a life-long skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages, an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people (15%).
That’s why investing in language teaching is now important for modern children.
Knowing several languages, especially developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding a full job.
In Scotland, every school will learn their own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK from a 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed regardless of what has prepared them for the future.
Now it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.

Lebron to debut with Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see the first start of Lebron James for the Los Angeles Lakers almost waited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first pre-season match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play has not yet been resolved.
"It's going to be more than one or less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said James would likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season game of Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he replied.
Trump Ratings in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today starts a series of election rallies from Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including rallies in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy he proposed to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump seeks to form support for the upcoming medium-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s evening rally take place in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wiling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours east time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to mention the tense hearings that took place this week over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanano, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the Senate vote for a week while the FBI investigation is ongoing.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans with gaining popularity before the November elections.
President Trump said the five rallies next week aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Control over Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible because the tense season of the election campaign is approaching,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to name his name is approaching.
Today’s rally is planned at the Wesbanko Arena stadium in Wiling, today’s rally can come by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reports.
The Saturday visit will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in a month, a state in which he won more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate to West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, whose rating lags behind the results of polls.
“It’s not good for Morrizi that the president comes to raise his rating in polls,” said Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team is set to fight and hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended in a unilateral victory, afternoon Saturdays can become exactly what the Ryder Cup lacked.
The tricky pendulum is a completely fictional sports concept that players really believe in, especially in such competitions.
So when they say the impulse is acting?
"They were six points ahead, and now four, so I think we perceive it a little as a impulse," Jordan Spit said when he was in.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their sails, and they also encourage a lot, not least the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
The sweat with his killer blows from one-place to green shows an example.
These larynx screams of the celebration became louder when he continued his round he made a decisive patch and equalized the score in a fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His patch, which allowed them to win the match on the 15 holes, met with a similar cry, one that tells you that the American team does not seem to be.
“You really just have to try hard and worry about your own match,” Spit said.
That’s all that each of these players has left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and can not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make Boggi on Saturday after lunch, they also managed to avoid boggi morning on Saturday and after lunch on Friday and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back makes them win Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to consolidate the potential victory of Europeans when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
Both are both on different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the triumph of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt with Sergio Garcia, a hero of morning forbols when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One Boggi and two dables on the first nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedes to the hole, from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
Forbols and nozzles are very interesting to observe close through the interaction between the participants of the couple, through the tips they give, tips they do not give, and it is also interesting to observe how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe is still playing better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of foroms has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight what some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday forbols and nozzles, it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the backward Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
Thomas Bjorne’s European team, which is trying to return the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning forbols with a score of 3-1.
The US resisted more in the forks and won two matches, but failed to cut the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points on 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (along Mollywood) after the sensational weekend is only the second pair to score four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After cracking Woods and Patrick Reed in the forbols, they teamed up to defeat the bloated Woods and American newcomer Bryson Deshambo with even more spectacular 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed random flashes of genius, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in forbols and forks and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who was not involved in morning forbols, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in nozzles to get 2th1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, who are the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe failed to do everything in its own way of this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three times the main winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday set the standard for Americans with their two points.
They won a decisive victory of 2th1 over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Polter in the forbols and later defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy with a score of 4ta3 in forks, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned with a four-point shortage in singles, although Furika's team only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks like she could not.
North Korea says "no way" will be disarmed unilaterally without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister on Saturday told the UN that the extension of sanctions deepens distrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country would in no way be able to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea took “essential goodwill measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and commitment not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
Although Re repeated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement proved important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ree referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the real U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on the “denuclerization of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump promised North Korea’s security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must initially abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists calls to ease severe international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclarization at first’ and raising the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even object to the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Re said.
“To believe that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Re did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, at which the US leader stressed at the UN at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have gone into such a dead end.”
Despite this, the tone of Re's performance was sharply different from last year when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after Trump called Kim a "missible man" who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, at the UN, Trump, who threatened to “fully destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in disarming measures, but said that much more will need to be done and sanctions should remain in force to denuclearize North Korea.
Trump said on Wednesday that he did not set a time frame for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and steadily until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Re on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for "gangster demands".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to disassemble the missile system as well as a nuclear complex if the United States is taking “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim said he needed “appropriate measures” are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how enough to rest
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all its students with more sleep. This is an attempt to fight the growing culture of cool learning all night after refueling caffeine.
The teacher found that the number one university students in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, one girl approached him and said, “Why am I being told this now, in the last year?”
“She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep that surprised me,” a teacher from The Telegraph shared.
In the course, which was first introduced this year, students are explained by the basics of how good sleep habits help achieve academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s medical services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep for a week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section has images of a room in a hostel where students click cups of coffee, curtains, simulators and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficiency on sports performance, and the importance of sleep-related routine.
In another section, participants tell how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change students’ behavior instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have the right to know about the effects of smoking cigarettes for health,” added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride for “sleeping all night” still exists, he added, and also noted that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with a gain of excess weight, since sleep deprivation translates the brain into a hunger regime that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler develop a course after enrolling on one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all graduate students with a request to undergo a similar program of study before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chaseler recommends that students put a reminder that you need to go to bed, as well as put an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” that is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to problems with falling asleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Ringers": the goal of Mengue upset Gerrard's guys
Rangers survived another attack of outbound sadness: Dolly Menga's strike brought Stephen Gerrard's disparable team a 1-0 defeat from Livingstone.
The Ibrox team sought to win its first victory at the outbound match after the February triumph over St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard a second defeat as manager from 18 games. Gerrard's team remained eight points behind the leaders of the Scottish Premiership Harts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers composition, which lacked inspiration, did not look like it could equalize the score.
Now "Rengers have fallen to sixth position, and Livingston has risen to the third, and only "Hibernian" are ahead of the ball difference.
In addition, Rangers may face another trouble, because the lineman Kalum Spence was forced to handle a head wound after being thrown into him by some object from the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once passed by Air in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same line-up "Left 11", which took one point to Harts last week, and was delighted with his forced guys squeezed opponents at every step.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston worked more with the ball.
They were to score just two minutes later when Menga's first pass to the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gate of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder wasted this great chance by sending the ball past the gate.
Keagan Jacobs' deep free blow reached the spyer Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithow hit the back bar
Rangers really got control, but the last third had more hope than believing in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had to be eligible for a penalty at a quarter of an hour after a collision with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed to make only two strikes on the gate in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly hit Lassana Kulibali's head and the calm blow of Ovie Edjaria hardly bothered.
And while the remaining goal of Livingstone in 34 minutes may have contradicted the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only with their hard work.
Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' preparation again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Mengue for a simple ending.
In a break, Gerrard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the winger broke into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly joined his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to force guests to play exactly a game they like when Lithow and Halkett make one long pass after another.
Holt's team could improve the result in the last stages, but McGregor opposed Jacobs well before Lithow was hit from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for Rangers, made another late penalty application when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson again took a look.
Almanach: inventor of Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time goes... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gance" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Giger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Coronado Bells with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubious-scientist cowboys.
Man: “What is it?”
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, which is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear how radioactivity affects atoms in minerals.”
Evans: "Well, it's really cracking now!"
Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancer. Next, these cells are reintroduced to the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells in a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can "see" common to many types of cancer protein (HER2), and further re-enteration of these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of several types of cancers’, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer,” he explained.
A similar approach, which consists in removing immune cells in patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells, worked in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show in the MAGA baseball cap Kanye West leaked with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What caused the negative reaction of the audience
Viewers at the SNL show studio (Saturday Night Live) mastered Kanye after his sad performance, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for presidential post in 2020.
After performing a third song, Ghost Town in a baseball cap with the inscription "Let's Return America's Former Glory" he exploded with a tirade in which he criticized Democrats, and again declared his support for Trump.
“Often during the conversation, whites ask me, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch of Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavano's testimony, which he gave to the Senate Legal Committee in the case of a lawsuit by Christine Blasey Ford about violent acts of a sexual nature.
Although Vesta's speech was not broadcast live, the video with his tyrad was posted on social media comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule Vesta by placing this post.
West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had an unpleasant situation due to the headgear.
West said: “When I was behind the scenes, I was rudely treated.
I was told, “Don’t go out to the audience in this baseball cap.”
They were mocking me!
And then I'm told I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'll wear my Superman baseball cap because so no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to continue moving forward?
Try to treat each other with love.”
According to the weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction of viewers in the hall, and the actors of the SNL show looked confused. One of the viewers said: "The studio was dominated by dead silence."
Vesta was invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the air.
West was surprised by performing the song I Love it (I love it) in Perrier water bottle costume.
Vesta was supported by the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Kendes Turner, who tweeted: “One of the bravest: I thank you for the fact that he was against NATOVP.”
Instead, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
“But I will not reward him (buying his music or clothes or supporting its ‘art’, who I think professes and outsups an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she added.
Before performing on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: now he was "one who was previously known as Kanye Vesta."
West is not the first performer to change his name. He follows Diddy's example, also known as Puff Deddy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
The rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was previously called Snoop Lyon, and, as you know, the musical legend of the last decades Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became "Artist, formerly known as Prince".

Game of Thrones star Keith Gerington condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Gerington became famous for his role as a warrior with John Snow's sword in the brutal medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor of performances condemning the stereotype of the hero-maco, claiming that due to such heroes on the screens, young guys often seem that they should become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith stated that he believed "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the era of popularity of the hashtag ?MeTo (jjaalso, «Yap», etc.).
Keith, who recently married his colleague in Game of Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said he was "voluntarily determined" determined to fight the problem.
“I am quite determined at the moment. When did we embark on the slim path of idealization of brutality?” he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up through the prism of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He continued, "What is natural and what are we planted?
Why does television and the street teach that young guys feel the pressure to be just such men?
I think today is the really important question, “How can we change this?”
It is obvious that the young guys have lost the right way.”
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be shot in any prequels and sequels of Game of Thrones after the show of the series next summer, as he "has already ended with battles and horses."
From November, Keith will play in the production of the play "The Real West" by Sam Shepard - a story about the film producer and his brother robber.
As an actor recently admitted, he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best he received from participating in the series “Game of Thrones”.
“During the filming of this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life,” Keith said.
In the fantasy series that received the Emmy Awards, Rose played Igritt - the love of Gerington's hero John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018. The ceremony was held on the territory of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has a sharp increase in 14% of new cases of the disease
China has announced a sharp increase in 14% of the number of HIV and AIDS citizens.
According to health care authorities, in total, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, which indicates a change in the past trend.
In some regions of China, HIV was rapidly distributed due to infected blood during transfusions.
However, health officials said during a conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000 people.
Overtime HIV transmission is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to the study, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men subsequently marry women due to dominance in the country of conservative values.
Transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of protection during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV medicines, seeing this way partially solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of Republican senators' data on the network by its full-time worker and sharply criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives Maxine Waters condemned unfounded statements that one of its full-time workers had posted personal data from three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that these statements are distributed by political observers and websites.
“The lie, lies, and then even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Getch of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were placed by an unknown person from the Capitol during hearings in the Senate Commission regarding charges of illegal sexual acts brought against Brett Kavano, a candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The data leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavano.
The Hill reported that conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState appeared that the IP address of the source source is related to the Waters office and it managed to find the data of its full-time employee.
“These baseless statements are absolutely untrue, they do not correspond to reality,” Waters continued.
“A employee of my office, whose personal data and security are at risk as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These baseless statements are absolutely untrue, they do not correspond to reality.
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized on the network, among others, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer also spoke.
“This objection is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that with this nature it cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn’t do, you don’t have to be angry.
The accused should not behave boldly.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and indestructible.”
Fleischer seems to have drawn parallels between Waters' reaction and Democratic criticism against Judge Kavano, who was accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to take Waters' place in the midterm election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“This is news if everything is really true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had already reported "the relevant state bodies and law enforcement agencies about these false statements."
“We will do everything possible to ensure that the perpetrators are found,” she continued, “and they responded before the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees.”
Review of the film "Agent Johnny English: New Mission" - a passing parody of spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look for meanings in every new British film, inspired by Brexit. They are also in the new part of the series of comedy parodies for militants about Johnny English. The first film called "Johnny English" was released in 2003, later the series was resumed in 2011, shooting "Johnny English: Relaunch".
Will there be a mocking-ironic self-satire on what we are poor, the new export potential of the nation?
One way or another, Johnny English, with his moving face and eyes, was given the opportunity to develop disorder for the second time, while his name is more than anything else indicates that this comic character is created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a caplessly fun secret agent in which, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, there is a little from Inspector Cluzo, a little from Mr. Bean and much from the guy who played one note of the melody from the movie “Fire chariots” at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The character’s prototype is also a traveler and a mystery of international scale, which has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s long-forgottened television advertising.
In the last film about Johnny English, there are some good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny English in knightly armor was approaching the helicopter, and the rotor blades were ringing against his helmet.
The film clearly reveals Atkinson's talent to arrange a buphonade, but humor is passing, and at some points it is too much, especially when compared with "serious" film brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission is impossible", one of the "inredients" of which is also comedy.
It seems that jokes are designed for children rather than adults, and I have meaningless misfortunes that happen to Johnny English do not seem so inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson's wigs in silent films about Bean.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat over the UK.
The British supersecret spy network penetrates a hacker and reveals the names of all field agents, which was a complete surprise for the current agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episodic role in the film).
This turned out to be the last drop for the Prime Minister - a puffocated person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to convey the image inspired by Theresa May, but the script did not allow him to fully reveal it).
Intelligence officials informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needs to attract someone from the retired.
The choice falls on the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at some superfashion institution and unofficially teaches children operational work undercover (in this part with the spy "school of the Year" Inglish for teenagers had several successful jokes).
English is quickly delivered to Whitegol for an urgent briefing, where he again meets his long-suffering friend Buff, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine captain (the role of an exaltated annoying person does not quite correspond to Vicky Pepperdin's talent).
So, when everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service went squerebert, Batman and Robin return to the line and suddenly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoltov, played by Olga Kurylenko.
At this time, the prime minister falls under the charms of a charismatic billionaire who earned his fortune in technology and technology and claims that he can eliminate the problem with the British network, the grievous Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on a trip and again resort to their ridiculous pranks: dressed by waiters they fire in a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally traveling abroad on a luxury yacht Volta; Inglish arranges a real mess when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with the layout of the house.
All stops lead us to the last episode, but with his kindness and frenzyness, it resembles a movie for children.
The passing film.
As with other films about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: can the British film industry offer Roven Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies preparing a plan that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is due to discuss a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but will be paid in five days.
The party wants to oblige company executives to transfer funds saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, employees, providing them with an additional weekend.
Thus, workers will have a three-day weekend and at the same time bring home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will correspond to the party’s economic program and direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved at the British Trade Union Congress. It is seen that in this way workers will be able to benefit from changing the general economic situation.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the party’s general industrial strategy.
Labour was not the first to approve of this idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of such a desire.
The Labour Party speaker said: “The party’s political program does not provide for the introduction of a four-day working week, so now we are not considering this idea.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party election convention last week.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” of utility companies and “exhibiters.”
The plan of the “shadow” chancellor also means that shareholders of water supply companies can not receive their entire share of capital if the Labour government introduces “department” on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed his intentions to include workers in the board of companies and create inclusive stocking funds to transfer 10% of the conventional shares of private sector firms to workers waiting for annual dividends of up to ?500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the 60 Minutes (60 minutes) show whether the FBI’s Cawano investigation could change their minds.
In connection with the investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanano, which is being conducted by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment to the position of Supreme Court judge is postponed for at least a week. The question arises whether Republican senators will continue to support Kavanano after the results of the investigation of the bureau were published.
In Sunday's 60 Minutes show, correspondent Scott Pelli asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
During the hearing, I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanano.
I called him after it happened and the accusation asked him, “Did you really do it?”
He was determined, unshakable, uncompromising.”
Graham’s opinion seems to change nothing.
“I believe that the nomination of Kavanano charges is a provocation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
Anyone she calls can’t confirm it under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event in the music world with a stunning number of star artists and no less striking mission to overcome poverty around the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be bullied at the Great Hall of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the true goal of the festival - the organizers seek to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket for an event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors must perform a number of tasks or "doings", such as taking part in a volunteer project, write an email to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else to help draw attention to the goal of the organization - eradicating poverty.
So are there any results, because there are 12 years left to achieve the goal of the organizers of Global Citizen?
Is it really an idea to reward a free concert for an act — a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” when people feel like they really change something by signing an electronic petition or by posting on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “acts” of their supporters aimed at achieving various goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programs worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 financial obligations and public statements as an example of the results of its activities, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
The group estimates that the funds provided have already directly affected the lives of approximately 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main financial obligations can be mentioned by The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to the UK. As part of the project, investors and implementers committed to “help children grow up” and promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million in assistance to overcome the problem of malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 messages on Twitter from the Global Citizens organization.
“With the support of the UK government, patrons, other countries and citizens like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history,” said Tracy Ullman, a spokesman for The Power of Nutrition, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also said that after 5,000 “acts” that called for improved nutrition of mothers and children, the UK government announced the allocation of funds for the Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: “This is a long and difficult way, so sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the members of the civil rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janell Mona is only part of the star artists who will perform at the festival in New York this year, and will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
Interior Minister says U.S. could use naval forces to “blockade” to prevent Russian energy resources from exporting Russian energy resources
According to a quote by U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, given in the Washington Examiner, “if necessary,” Washington can seek help from the naval forces to prevent Russian energy resources from entering markets, including Middle East markets.
Zinke said Russia’s participation in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to be an intermediary in energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
“Thanks to the US naval forces, it can ensure free passage by sea routes and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke appealed to the participants of the event, held by the Consumer Energy Alliance (Energy Consumer Alliance), a non-profit organization that positions itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we effectively use energy resources and replace them alternative,” he said, calling Russia “one-sidedly developed” because its economy depends on energy carriers of mineral origin.
While these statements were made, the Trump administration has set a goal to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, displacing Russian energy from the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To do this, Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “inappropriate” project to build the Nord Stream 2 road pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, the cost of which is $ 11 billion and which will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an economic project.
The Kremlin is convinced that Washington is strongly opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we share the view that energy resources cannot be a pressure tool and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, which took place in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading industry organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like when a third country interferes in our energy supplies,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federal Association, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will “seriously think” about running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday he would "seriously think" about running for president after the midterm election.
During a public meeting in Golyok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering putting his candidacy.
Warren said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and establish the work of the government, and for this there must be a woman at its head.”
“After November 6, I will seriously think about bringing my candidacy for president.”
During a public meeting, Warren expressed her assessment of Donald Trump’s presidency, saying he “leads his country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank, criticizing Trump and his proposed candidacy for the position of Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanano.
In a Friday tweet, Warren wrote, "...unlessly, before the vote, the FBI must conduct an investigation."
However, according to a survey released on Friday, most Warren voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a survey jointly conducted by the Suffolk University Political Studies Center and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential Massachusetts voters spoke out against the Senator’s nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The results of the survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoys greater support. For the potential nomination of him to the post of President, 38% spoke against 48%.
During discussions, other prominent Democrats who could run in 2020 also call former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Peilin during a rally in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence. The incident occurred on Monday night.
“What my son is now going through, which he is going through after his return, can only understand other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers return home,” she said in front of a rally in support of Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Track's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said her son and other war veterans "return home not as they were before, more cruel, and want to know whether their brothers soldiers, pilots and other military personnel have respected here."
According to a spokesman for the police department of Vasilla, Dan Bennett, Treka was arrested Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as that he prevented reports of violence and carried weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication.
18 states and the District of Columbia support asylum policy appeal
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support appeal against a new U.S. policy, according to which victims of bandit persecution and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note of a court consultant to Washington to support the plaintiff who needs asylum and challenged the policy in court.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions on the claim of the American Civil Rights Union, in which federal policy is challenged and which was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The plaintiff said her partner "and his brutal bandits" beat her, but U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace’s lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees of whom often seek asylum in the United States) often face such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy cancels the decision of the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board, according to which immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence could seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, General Carl Reisin, said during his speech on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state laws, federal and international laws."
“The federal law requires that decisions on applications for refugee status are based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the ban violates this principle,” the court consultant said in an analytical note.
Further in the analytical note, prosecutors argue that policies that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States harm the country’s economy as they could potentially become entrepreneurs and “fill the necessary labor resources.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order for immigration judges in June that it was no longer able to grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“The shelter is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views,” Sessions said during the presentation of the policy on June 11.
The provision of asylum has never been intended to solve all the troubles, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers are desperately trying to find those who are still alive, while the number of deaths in Palu has doubled.
For those who remain alive, the situation is still deteriorating.
“The situation is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulance brings the bodies.
There is no clean water.”
Some residents return to their destroyed homes, take over the flooded benefits, trying to save what they found.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals damaged by an earthquake whose strength was 7.5 points on the Richter scale are crowded.
Some of the wounded, including the Two Geris with a fracture of the back and shoulder, rest near the building of the army hospital Palu, where patients are provided with open air care due to constant repeated shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears when he recalled how a strong push shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was pushed among the debris of the wall,” Geris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife beg for help and then I had silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “making psychological pressure” through “advertising that contains propaganda”
A week after a state-owned Chinese newspaper posted on four pages of the American daily edition advertising material on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid app of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular Iowa newspaper after accusing China of trying to influence the elections to Congress, which will take place on November 6. China rejects these accusations.
According to Reuters, Trump’s statements, in which he accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the U.S. elections mean a new phase of escalation by Washington, whose goal is pressure on China.
While foreign governments can place ads to intensify trade, there is an escalation of trade war between Beijing and Washington on time, in which they have already increased import duties.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of repressive duties in China was intended to strike exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Bransted, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, China’s largest agricultural exporter, said China had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Bransted wrote in the column of the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "enoughs pressure by publishing advertising containing propaganda in our independent press."
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the way for the American people the tradition of freedom of speech and press independence by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Bransted wrote.
"In contrast, on street layouts here in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of dissenters. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the development of the Chinese economy, which is of concern, which can be concluded that the Chinese media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respected Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that Republicans are setting up women voters against themselves before the midterm elections
As many prominent Republicans support and defend the candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavano after he has been charged with sexual harassment, analysts warn that this could cause an undesirable reaction ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, especially women.
Passions are raging around this situation, and most Republicans publicly declare they would like to move to a vote.
Such things can’t just be played back,” said Grant Riger, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse, during an interview with The Hill.
Rieger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, which at the last minute began to insist on Senator Jeff Flake (a Republican from Arizona), would be enough to calm angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., chief adviser and spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn (Go on), Catherine Jean-Perrie said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget about it either tomorrow or November.”
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters sang "November is approaching!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when Republicans decided to move on to the approval of Kavanano's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
In an interview with the news website, Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political observer, said: "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
“They say it’s the case now, and that’s true.
However, motivation may intensify, especially in women voters 18-29 years old with a suburbs who have not yet decided and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford testified in connection with the charges of a candidate for the position of Supreme Court judge in sexual crime, analysts predicted a negative voter reaction if Republicans insisted on approval.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, earlier this week, said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As noted in an interview with the news channel, Director of Priorities USA (the group that helps in the election campaign to Democrats), "the case is not in the voting of the committee, the final vote or that Kavano was on the bench of defendants, and how they reacted to this situation and how they acted further."
However, the thoughts of Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavanano, divided. Ford has a little more support.
According to the results of a new survey from YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford’s testimony, while Kavanano believes or rather believes 35% of respondents.
In addition, 38% of respondents said they thought Cavano gave or most likely gave false testimony, while 30% of respondents said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after the insistence of Flake, the FBI conducts a check of the charges put forward by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Legal Committee on how Kavanano attacked her while in a state of alcoholic intoxication when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez said the Supreme Court judge candidate showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Internet inventor plans to launch a “new Internet” to create competition for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of the world of technology, Inrupt, is engaged in the development of an open source platform Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and to whom to access a particular information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which will allow users to create a "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can store contact lists, lists of current cases, calendar, audio recording library and other tools for own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at the same time.
A unique feature of this personal online data storage is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “expansion of personal capabilities through data.”
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company aims to use resources, processes and relevant skills to ensure that the Solid platform becomes available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several full-time developers hired to work on the project, and the community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete replacement when all their business models undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to “provide commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network based on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: celebration on the presentation of the representative of the church to the Order of the "Christ of Victoria" during the First World War
The only representative of the Church of England, who received the Order of Victoria Cross for his participation in hostilities during World War I, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, St. Bernard Vann, received the award for his participation in the attack near Belanglis and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he died from a sniper bullet four days later and never learned that he had received the highest military award in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather made a feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann moved his battalion through the Saint-Katen Canal "through a very thick fog and under the dense fire of field guns and machine guns."
Later he hurried to the fire section and with "desperate bravery" led the line forward, before that one broke through to the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Bath shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather did what he himself could never repeat and deserve respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann laid a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "feel very proud of being involved in this parade" and added that "the courage of the real hero demonstrates the respect that so many people express to him."
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead they were shown the "Peppe Pig"
Imagine that you don’t sleep all night just to watch the event-rich Bellator 206 tournament, and you are denied the opportunity to view the main event.
The posters of the tournament, held in San Jose, indicated 13 fights, including six matches of the main program, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just before Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet in a match, viewers in the UK were surprised when the Peppe pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the battle.
Some viewers were not delighted with it, as they did not sleep until the morning, waiting for the fight.
One fan wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some unsuccessful joke."
“According to the government’s ruling, the content that was broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to let the child’s transfer,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and public relations when asked about the TV show.
"Peppa Pig," yes."
Bellator President Scott Cocker has promised to work on a broadcast schedule to reach viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think if we talk about repeating the broadcast, we can arrange it,” Koker said.
“But now there is Sunday, 6 am, and we can’t do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we responded to, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical malfunction and tried to eliminate it.
However, it turned out that this was a discrepancy with government regulations.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We'll cut the tournament to five fights instead of six as usual. We tried to redirect the signal to fans, but so far we have postponed these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “worst” than others because of his sexual orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he did not understand that "not everyone looks like him" until he went to high school.
Taking part in the program of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he spoke frankly about gay rights to give a "hope" to others.
He also said that because of paternity it became less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The host, who has been running this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for several months.
When he came as a bet on Lavern's first program, Daley said he felt "worst" than others as a child, because "society didn't take it when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "By this time, the feeling of inferiority and difference was exactly what gave me inspiration and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that something "worthy" so as not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a well-known fighter for the rights of the LBGT community and took advantage of the appearance on this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke frankly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this “hope” to others.
Three-time world champion admitted that the feeling of a man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise for him.
Daley got along with an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him, last year, but, according to him, age difference has never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” (at the first Olympic Games he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it is difficult to find someone of his age who would also survive such ups and downs.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and since then, according to Daley, his "world perception" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would only think about getting gold,” he said.
“You know that there are things much more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept the idea of the end and before his death asked if they had purchased tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not sitting in the front row because you’re not going to be there anymore,” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life: to dive in front of my compatriots at the Olympic Games, and there was no feeling better than that,” Daley said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song - Proud (Pride) performed by Heather Small - who resonated with him in preparation for the Olympic Games and still causes ants.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 English summer time.
On Saturday, Michelson was taken out from the tournament match for the Ryder Cup, who was not in shape.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup tournament, but he must regain shape so that this event does not become unhappy for him.
Michelson, who takes part in the tournament, which takes place every two years, was brought out of the game by Captain Jim Furik during the forbols and forks.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained aside, hoping to master emotions.
Since Michelson was not famous for the good blows even while at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete was not quite suitable for a complex Le Golf National golf course, where the raph usually punishes for wandering blows.
And if the field is not such an obstacle, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson will have to meet with the Open Championship champion and the master of the exact blow of Francesco Molinari, who paired with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all his matches this week.
If Americans who lag behind three points after 12 single matches start well, Michelson's match can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and, probably, besides this he had nothing to add.
“He fully understood his role today, splashed me on my back, hugged me and said that tomorrow he would be ready,” Furik said.
“He has no doubt about his abilities.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, who did so much for the teams last week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I predicted more games, but it happened, and so we decided to act like this.
He wants to be there, on the field, like anyone else.”
If Michelson goes out on the field on Saturday, he will break the record of Nick Faldo, who played the largest number of matches in the Ryder Cup tournament.
In this he may end his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which never matched his individual achievements.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 draw results, but Furik said his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
“He’s funny, friendly, witty, likes to joke with others, he’s a guy he’s cool to have on the team,” Furik explained.
“I think the younger players had fun, coming to him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He is more than just a player.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big gap does not decide anything.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from the experience that a tangible gap before the singles matches of the last day of the tournament for the Ryder Cup does not yet guarantee victory.
Datchanin made his debut in 1997 in a game on the field of the Walderram club, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros ahead of the Americans by five points, but won the match with a slight gap with a score of 141-2:131-2.
“You remind yourself that we had a big gap in the Walderra field match; a big gap in Brookline where we lost and on the Walderra field where we won hard,” Bjorn said after watching Class 2018 winning games with a score of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National Stadium, after which the gap is 10:6.
So history teaches me and every player of the team that nothing has yet been resolved.
Tomorrow we have to play with maximum dedication.
Go to the field and do everything you need.
The game will be completed only after the result appears on the table.
We have a goal to get this trophy, and that’s what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are well aware of who is opposed to us - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with his players on a complex field, Bjorn added: "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow it can be different.
Tomorrow we have individual matches, and that’s something else.
It’s great to play on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but just when you stand alone there, and you can check what you are worth as a golfer.
Here’s how to set up players to perform tomorrow: on the verge of opportunities.
You leave your partner without support and now he also has to show what he is capable of.”
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furick expects his partners to play better at an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Until Furika himself, fate returned to various sides on the last day: he was among the winners in Brookline, but was defeated when the team from Europe created the Miracle in Medina.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Cranshaw, the team captain in 1999, organized players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow. But we need to successfully start, as it was in Brookline and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone else’s side, players are under special pressure in the middle of the distance.
We have properly placed the players in the team, as if we are going to do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead a counterattack in the top match against Rory Macilroy. Next, the first half of the list of Europeans included Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
“It is these partners and in this order that I chose because I want to evenly distribute efforts throughout the game,” Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The introduction of a new German warship was again postponed
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was to be put into operation in 2014 instead of outdated Cold War fighting vessels. However, according to local media information, this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rapid increase in costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from the spokesman of the military department, the commissioning of the ship "Rainland-Pfaltz", the main vessel of the series of the most modern frigates of the class "Baden-Wurtemberg", is postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery damaged the implementation of an ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Wurtemberg class, which the naval department ordered in 2007, are to replace the outdated Bramen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies for reducing visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical support. It is expected that new frigates will be able not to return to the base port for about two years.
However, Die Zeit journalists warn that due to constant delays, ultra-modern warships that were to strengthen Germany’s military power at sea will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The long-suffering frigate F125 got into newspaper headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the return of a warship to a shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant "defects of software and equipment", due to which the combat vessel became unsuitable for military operations.
The disadvantages of software are particularly important, since the crew of the Baden-Wurtemberg-class ship consists of about 120 sailors - this is only half the number of military personnel who served on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel has a significant excess of weight, which worsens its performance and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
The Reinland-Pfaltz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) for ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the price of crew training.
The expected 2.2 billion euros turned into a colossal 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion US dollars).
Problems with obtaining new frigates have gained special weight in light of recent warnings about the decline of the German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, the representative of the Bundestag on the armed forces Hans-Peter Bartels said that the country's Navy "there were few ships suitable for combat missions."
The official said the situation had deteriorated rapidly over time, as old vessels were decommissioned and new ones did not arrive.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wurtemberg class were able to replenish the Navy.
The National Trust will watch the secret life of bats
A new study, which is conducted in land ownership in the Scottish Highlands, aims to establish how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data obtained will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take measures to preserve them in the future.
In the Inveryu gardens in Wester-Rosss, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe species such as non-topir dwarfs and a non-topir pigmey, as well as ears ordinary and water night.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations on land ownership to observe bat behavior during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and belonging of bat screams.
Then it is planned to develop a detailed map of animal habitat and prepare a report to link animal behavior with their habitat.
Rob Dewar, an advisor on nature protection at the National Trust of Scotland, hopes the results of the study will help determine which areas of residence are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of habitat care measures (e.g., meadow formation) and identify optimal methods of preserving forests for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations have decreased significantly in Scotland and in the UK.
They are threatened with active construction and development of territories, which deprives them of nesting sites.
Among other negative factors are wind installations and lighting, adhesive paper for flies, chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
The bats are not blind.
However, due to hunting at night, the ears are more effective to help them catch prey than their eyes.
They use a complex echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles to flight trajectories.
In the National Trust of Scotland, which takes care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, take bat problems very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, inspection nesting sites and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland. It is located on the territory of the Trive in the Dumfris and Galloway region. It found refuge eight of the ten types of bats living in Scotland.
David Thompson argues that this is the perfect place for them.
“There are excellent conditions for bats on the territory of the city,” he assures.
“There are old buildings, many huge trees and other favorable living conditions.
However, we still need to learn a lot about bats. Thanks to the research we do here and elsewhere, we will be able to learn more about what they need for prosperity."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for bats before any technical work, since due to the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the removal of young people, up to 400 females with cubs can die, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
The bats and their nests are protected by law. The animal is forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Center, urged the public to join the organization's efforts.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats. We have not yet revealed the characteristic features of populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German edition
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges a "defam" and said people "try to attract attention" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information about suspicions.
American Catherine Majorga accused the forward of Portugal and Juventus football club of rape, which occurred in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $75,000 for silence.
Hours after the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his fans in a video broadcast on Instagram, calling the corresponding messages a “defam”.
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today’s accusations are slander,” the five-time winner of the Golden Ball made a statement on camera.
“They want to get attention using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to make money on me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I am a happy person and I am fine,” the football player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for published charges, which they called “an unacceptable report of suspicion of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Sherz said the footballer would demand compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is likely one of the most pressing cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
The incident is claimed to have occurred in June 2009 in a Palms Casino room in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's number, where he allegedly analy raped her. Such evidence was transferred to the Clark County District Court (Nevada).
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to her knees and said he was a "99 percent good guy" who was exposed to "one percent".
As stated in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but with mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where the injuries she suffered were photographed. However, she later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she "feared revenge" and was wary of "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel the previous agreement as she continues to suffer due to an incident she said had taken place.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was preparing to move to Real Madrid FC with Manchester United FC. This summer he became a player of the grand Italian football, Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will ‘longly regret’ the loss of automakers
The UK will “longly regret” if it loses its status as a world leader in the field of auto production after Brexit. This is warned by Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was praised by a statement by Toyota UK representatives who told BBC journalists that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, the company would be forced to suspend the production and operation of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Bernaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain urgently leaves the EU in late March, production at our plant will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s CEO in Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how the UK’s exit from the EU will affect without an international trade deal.
BMW said the Mini plant in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are that no-deal Brexit could cause risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in the mode of operational delivery of parts and materials according to needs - parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be interruptions in the supply of details on March 29, which will lead to delays and shortages of materials.
As noted in the company, in the composition of Toyota you can place parts no more than one day. So production will have to be stopped.
Greg Clark said that in terms of organizing relations with the EU prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), "separately provided schemes for avoiding problems at the border."
"We need a deal. We need to make the best deal that I think will allow not only to succeed at the moment, but also take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the Today program on BBC Radio 4.
“Given the testimony of Toyota representatives as well as other automakers, we need to maintain the formed highly efficient supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to report how long production will be stopped, but in the long term it is expected that an increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, will force to reduce jobs.
Peter Tsvalaris, chairman of the Unite Trade Union organizing committee at the Bernaston plant, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants are extremely concerned: "From experience, I can say that reduced jobs are not being restored."
The government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan to form our future relations with the EU.”
Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could be postponed again, White House said
According to White House officials on Sunday, Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “put for another week” while discussions are ongoing about Brett Kavano’s candidacy for the position of Supreme Court judge.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For months, Washington has been discussing the likelihood of the release of Deputy Attorney General, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the president’s powers under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House amid reports that the official was going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would "not like" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a match over time with a meeting of the Senate Legal Committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, was to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed a vote in the Senate.
Trump’s spokesman Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday television show.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting was not scheduled. Perhaps it will take place this week. I expect that it will be postponed for another week, given all events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I'm constantly making sure that the press has the last information."
Some journalists disagreed with this: Sanders has not held a media briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the infrequent briefings are not related to the dislike of "game to the public" by television reporters, although she added, "I will not deny that they are playing the public."
She then suggested that Trump himself would talk to the press more.
“The president answers questions more often than any president to him,” she said, without referring to the source, “Statistics speaks for itself.”
Sanders said the briefings would still be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the US president, it’s better than talking to me.”
We try to communicate with the press often. This should be especially noticeable over the past few weeks. The ability to talk to the US president is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case, acting in front of journalists and sometimes strangely.
Scottish Health Secretary of State appealed to EU workers over Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State for Health appealed in a letter to citizens of other EU countries working for the National Health Service of Scotland to express gratitude for their work and ask to continue it after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the value of applications for permanent displaced status for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman noted: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit continued. This autumn, appropriate decisions should be expected.
But the UK government is strengthening preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know that this period can be very alarming for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize again how I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and countries abroad share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving the work of the health care service in favor of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We really want you to stay.”
Christion Ebercrombie underwent urgent surgery after head injury
The midfielder of the team "Tennessey State Tigers" Christie Ebercrombi underwent an urgent operation after receiving a head injury in Sunday match against Vanderbilt Commodores, which his team lost with a score of 31:27. This was reported by a journalist of the newspaper Tennesseean.
The head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player had been injured shortly before the break.
"He went to the side line where he became ill," Reed said.
Behind the side line, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombi oxygen before taking it away on the nose for further examination.
The official representative of the Tennessee State Tigers team told Chris Harris of WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie operated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury." The Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-year student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He performed five ball interceptions on Sunday before leaving the game. Thus, he has 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers will pay more state duty in case of purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more duties in case of purchase of real estate in the UK. According to the new plans of Tori, additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless
This event neutralizes all Corbyn's attempts to attract young voters
Higher state duty will be charged from those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise an additional ?120 million a year to help the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in the UK will pay more duties. Additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing aimed at high-paying workers.
The increase in duties will apply to individuals and legal entities who do not pay taxes in the UK. Additional funds will be directed by the government to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open sky.
An additional duty that accompanies the increase in two-year antiquity for the second housing and real estate intended for rent can be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise an additional ?120 million per year.
According to experts, 13% of new real estate, which is being built in London, falls into the property of foreign citizens. This leads to an increase in prices and complicates the task for those who only dream of their own housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country, particularly in the capital, are empty, as a large number of foreign buyers most of the time live outside the country.
The new action plan came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in state duty to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying land without further using it. He urged Theresa May to abandon quotas for affordable real estate to correct the "disgusting position in the housing market" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of important real estate reforms, in particular rent control and the impossibility of eviction without good grounds.
It also proposes to expand the powers of local councils in the field of building new housing.
Theresa May said: “I promised that I would dedicate my premiere to the restoration of the British dream — for every new generation of life should be better.
This requires change in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it cannot be called fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own housing has become unattainable. The problem of living in the open air still remains very painful.
Jack Ross: “I want to be Scotland’s head coach above everything.”
Sunderland’s head coach Jack Ross says he is “over everything he wants” to ever lead Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scots took to rebuild the club from the northeast of the country, which now ranks third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to Stadium of Light this summer, returning last season of St. Mirren FC to the Premier League of Scotland.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I was in Scotland’s second team, but it’s over,” Ross said during the Sportsound program on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of Scotland at Hampshire Park Stadium. It always attracted me.
The only hope for me to be successful as the club’s head coach.”
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland FC, including Dick Lawyer, David Mois, Sam Ellardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach of FC Hello Atletik claims that he did not feel worried about moving to a large club following such authoritative names, previously rejecting offers from FC Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the current stage, I will assume that I have succeeded if the club returns to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and material and technical support, this club undoubtedly corresponds to the level of the Premier League,” he said.
“It will not be an easy task, but another result I’m unlikely to consider successful for myself.”
Ross has only been building a coaching career for three years. Prior to that, he worked as a second coach at FC Dambarton, and also spent 15 months at the coaching staff of FC Harts.
He then helped Hello recover after FC entered the third division, and the following season with St. Mirren went from the departure stage to winning the title of winners of the first division.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Claid FC, Hartlpool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was at a crossroads,” he recalls, speaking of the transition to FC Hello.
“I really believed that coaching was more suitable for me than the game.
It sounds strange because I was successful, I made good money on it and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many difficulties that you have to overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but in the role of head coach I feel in my place.
I have always been interested in coaching work. I have never felt so comfortable in my entire adult life, as after I chose this profession.

Study: 17:30 on Sunday is the perfect time for beer
Summer heat helped increase the revenue of British pubs, which are going through not the best times, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
According to calculations, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8%.
The author of the calculations Peter Martin of the CGA organization, which is engaged in advising on business development, said: “Thanks to sunny weather and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup, July passed according to the same scheme as the previous month, when pub revenue grew by 2.8%. And restaurants went even worse.
The next fall by 1.8% in July increased.
Pubs and bars focused on the supply of drinks, so far have the best indicators - the growth of their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
The pubs served with food have also been affected by heat, but not as much as restaurants.
Visitors are only interested in drinking.
In pub-controlled and bars, sales of drinks for the month increased by 6.6%. At the same time, food sales decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst at the licensing and hotel business at RSM, said: “We have seen any trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events remain the main factors affecting sales in the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to lose profits. The annual drop in sales by 4.8% is of particular concern against the background of the need to reduce costs.
A long hot summer came not at the best time for food supplying facilities. We will see whether the temperature we observed in August can give them such a necessary rest.
The overall growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new institutions, in July amounted to 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in the market’s introduction of new brands.
The industry indicator of sales of Coffee Peach Tracker in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups, the total turnover of which exceeds ? 9 billion. This is a generally accepted industry standard.
One in five children has a hidden account from parents on a social network
As shown by the results of the study, one in five children, sometimes not older than 11 years old, has a social media account hidden from parents and teachers.
A study covering 20,000 high school students found an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram
This news has increased concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a “main account” shown to parents
One in five children, sometimes not older than 11 years, creates an account on social networks that hides from adults.
A study covering 20,000 high school students found an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram, a social network for sharing photos.
This news has increased concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean "main" account shown to parents as well as one or more private.
The mother, who accidentally came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a call there "to rape me".
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that the additional account is secret.
HMC chairman Mike Buchanan said: “We are very concerned about the fact that many teens feel a desire to create an online space in which parents and teachers will not be able to find them.”
Eilide Doyle will become a “member of athletes’ interests” in Scottish Athletics
Eilide Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as an independent director during the annual general meetings of board members.
Doyle is Scotland’s most titled athlete. Council Chairman Jen Beatty called this step a great opportunity for those who lead the sports movement to take advantage of its extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilide is very respected among athletes in Scotland, the UK and the world. We are convinced that by involving her in the council, athletic sports in Scotland will be of great benefit,” Beatty said.
Doyle noted: "I will be inspired to act as an athlete's interest representative. I hope I can really benefit and promote the development of sports in Scotland."
An American, a four-time Olympic champion who won 200 and 400 meters races at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and now a sports observer for the BBC, lost the opportunity to walk through a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would show whether I could recover and how much.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I managed to recover completely. I learned to walk again and today I perform dynamic exercises!
Thank you for the words of support!”
In advertising, the milk sucker of women compared with cows - the opinions of Internet users were divided
The manufacturer of milk suckers has faced an ambiguous reaction of Internet users to advertising in which young mothers are compared to active cows.
To mark the release of the product, called "the world's first quiet milk sucker", the technology company consumer goods manufacturer Elvie has released an advertising in the style of humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that a new sucker provides to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cow for a song containing the following words: "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail" and "As you can see myself, it's not a pronunciation, but my breasts."
The choir then sings: "To suck, suck off to feed children. Suck, suck off so that milk does not waste."
However, the commercial published on the company’s Facebook page caused a violent discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of Internet users turned out to be ambiguous. Many noted that the advertising underestimated the "horrible organization" of milk production in industry.
“It is not a very reasonable decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their children are taken away from them a few days after birth,” wrote one of the users.
Elvie milk absorber can be easily hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here is another comment: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not attract them to advertise a milk sucker for women who need to feed their babies?
Someone added: “This advertisement is very far from reality.”
Other users spoke in defense of the commercial. One of the women's video seemed "very fun".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would definitely have bought such a thing if they were still breastfeeding.
When I sucked milk, I felt like a cow.
The advertisement is somewhat crazy, but I didn’t look for hidden content in it.
“A great product,” someone wrote.
Here is another comment: “A funny advertising focused on moms that suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertising is not aimed at highlighting the benefits and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use such products feel cows.
However, the Elvie sucker works completely quietly, has no wires or tubes and easily hides in a bra for feeding. Due to this, women can move freely, keep children and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother’s advertising agency, commented on the situation: “The Elvie sucker is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative representation.
By drawing a parallel between women who heal milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way to demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker will bring.
Elvie is not the first time that the news headlines are not in the news headlines.
As part of the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product while showing clothes from fashion designer Martha Yakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent town on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because tough rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration made it difficult to place children from caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, immigrants themselves acted as guardians without documents. Now they are afraid to jeopardize their own opportunity to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transferred to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Control Bureau, testified to Congress that Bureau staff arrested dozens of people who applied for unaccompanied minors.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal past.
“About 80% of people who are caregivers or members of their households are illegally in the country. Many of them are foreigners who committed offenses.
So we continue to persecute these people,” said Mr. Albens.
According to asylum workers, to treat children’s cases faster, officials have introduced new rules that require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days later.
Many of them will be able to use video conferencing, rather than coming to court in person to prove their legal status to immigration judges.
Those who, by the court decision, are not entitled to asylum, will be deported quickly.
According to asylum workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression. This can cause outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Human rights activists argue that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that moving children to the tent town and not giving enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk increasing the injury that many of them have already suffered.
Syria orders “occupation forces” to the United States, France and Turkey immediately withdraw troops
In addition, speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been going on war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also works as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so “the attitude to them will be appropriate.”
“They should go immediately and not put conditions,” he said at the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is actually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria. They mostly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In the war-torn country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
As for refugees, Mualem assured that the country has created proper conditions for their return. He also accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unreasonable fears" because of which refugees do not dare to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help people come back,” he said.
"We are seeing an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not provide assistance to Syria in the restoration of the country until a political agreement has been concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive by Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines", and expressed hope that military actions would be directed against jihadists, including militants associated with al-Qaeda, the al-Nusra Front, which "will be destroyed."
UN Commissioner Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee in the near future, which will include government and opposition representatives to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for holding elections.
Mualem put forward conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying his work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
Trump’s logic could be re-elected in 2020, if, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, he will not be empowered early after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, this would be the "most dramatic end of the presidency of all time"!
At the moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (to 1.05 million) on CNN and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million people in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the cable channel MSNBC was at the top of the ranking of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news was discussed.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s beyond our understanding,” said Neil Ber, executive producer of the drama The Last Candidate on ABC about Secretary of State, who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nall Scowell, an experienced humorist writer and author of Only Funny Moments: as well as a few harsh truths about entering the Hollywood men club, offers a different theory.
She recalled a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said. This story told me Mrs. Scowell.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of Rowe’s case against Wade, the possibility of reunion immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Distortion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it can’t be said that you’re just trying to stay informed citizens when six hours watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “well-informed” sources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort’s jacket from ostrich skin for $15,000 (“clothed clothes” — so wrote in The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump’s story.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
“The sense of reality show is partly due to the fact that you are fed something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive Officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the television program “Stars of Lombard”, about rotations in the cast and daily plot turns in the show Trump (conflict with NFL, support for Kim Jong-in).
If you afford to miss one episode, you can stand up hopelessly.
When I met Mr. Flace this week at his home on the north coast of Kauai Island, there was warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he sat at home looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not break away from the TV — not when Brett Kavano stood before the Senate Legal Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court hung in the hair.
“I remember how we created all those crazy shows at the time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” he told me.
"I saw it as a joke, but it seems they were right."

External inflows into the toughest midterm elections to Congress
Not surprisingly, additional cash infusions are directed in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, because due to the revision of the boundaries of constituencies, two current congressmen compete for one chair.
The struggle for this suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, is entered by a Democrat, member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won another district in the additional election last spring.
Lamb opposes another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were outlined in favor of Republicans contrary to the constitution.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused a severe confrontation between the financial units of the major parties, the Democratic Party Committee on Congress (DCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's name became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning with a minimum advantage in the 18th district during additional Congress elections in March, which enjoyed public attention.
This place belonged to Republicans for more than a decade. President Donald Trump won this district with an advantage of 20 points.
Political experts have given a slight advantage to Democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed his mind
Diplomats recalled the weak resistance from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which previously supported Beijing's position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varela. Earlier, Trump also had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled from there staff hired by the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "a recent decision to non-recognition Taiwan," Department spokesman Gezer Neuert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support for social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which provided for financial aid cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
According to the results of internal meetings, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity. A similar event was held last year, and it was regarded as a step forward in efforts aimed at keeping the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration representatives made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador stopped at this consideration.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence now plans to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign that the administration considers the event very important.
Three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, because there were no new harsh reports or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton in the White House declined to comment on the details of the internal discussions reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom were diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information provided by them was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn History
The next trouble may be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, strong confirmation of why can be found in the public information available now.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is checking a possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in Congress goes into other hands, Trump will have to report to congressmen, as well as to voters and, ultimately, fellow parties.
There are a lot of “if” in this case and I don’t want to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable, just like his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West began to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such turning point, and the unbridled movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now waiting for several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person on whom Mr. Mueller’s fate depends?
Rosenstein was in trouble while the newspaper had information that last year he offered to secretly record conversations with the president and shared considerations on Trump’s inconsistency in office.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
“How will we react if the investigation in the case against Brett Kavanano, which recently launched by the FBI, proves not sufficiently thorough or honest or if Kavanano’s candidacy for a position in the Supreme Court is approved despite convincing accusations of sexual harassment and providing false evidence?
And above all, will we vote for those members of Congress who can hold Trump accountable in the medium term?
If we fail these trials, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe we won’t fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that my embassy house once occupied.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With such a legacy, can I not look optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans from Rangers with optimism is waiting for a meeting with the Vienna Rapid
FC Rangers hosts Rapid (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive draw in Spain in a game with Villarreal earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with good chances to leave the G Europa League Group.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with Villarreal, which ended with a score of 2:2. However, he believes that FC Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve more.
“For us, this was a good result, because Villarreal is a strong team,” the 31-year-old player said.
“We went out on the game with the hope of getting something and got one point.
Perhaps at the end of the match we could go ahead, but in general, a draw can probably be considered a fair result.
In the first half, the opponent was better, but after the break we corrected the situation in our favor.
On Thursday, there will be another important confrontation in the Europa League.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be difficult. Our future rivals have shown a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of fans. I am sure that we will be able to fight and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, ranging from my injuries to changes in the club itself. But now the situation has normalized.
We have a great warehouse and all the guys are happy. Training is going well.
I hope we can go further, leave behind last season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear for retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize self-care, few people spoke about it with their family members.
About half of people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked about it with the children.
“People want them to be cared for by a family member, but they are in no hurry to start a conversation on this topic,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
That's where we need to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care unless you inform your wishes to relatives in advance.
Consult your advisor and family to determine where and how to get care, as this choice can be an important factor when determining cost.
Involve a financial advisor: he can advise a way to cover the appropriate costs.
Sources of long-term care financing include traditional insurance policy, hybrid life insurance policy, or independent security at the expense of your own funds (provided you have money).
Prepare legal documents carefully: this will allow you to avoid legal attraction in advance.
Prepare a power of attorney for your representative who will control your medical care and make sure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you can not do it personally.
In addition, we recommend you to issue a power of attorney for cash.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay bills in case of your incapacity.
Do not forget about minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs emergency medical care, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Write down such information to be ready.
"It's not just about finance. It's important who doctors," Martin says, "
What medications can be taken and
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare such a plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, government officials said, but the number of victims could rise.
Due to the failure of communications, officials dealing with humanitarian assistance cannot receive any information from the Dongal regency, an area north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 points.
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Let’s give some basic facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Dongala.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people according to data for 2017.
When the earthquake caused a tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
According to 2017 data in the regency, the administrative region located in the lower part of the province is home to approximately 299,200 people.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moravial, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency over the past 100 years, Palu and Dongal have been affected by a tsunami several times.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donald killed more than 200 people and killed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal. Then nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific Fire Ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, located in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceg.
2005: In late March in early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-point magnitude earthquake shook southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 points.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai islands located near Sumatra, and caused a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which killed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the regency of Pidijay in Aceg province, causing destruction and panic associated with the fact that people have not yet managed to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died under the wreckage of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not immediately leave the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Treka Peilin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of attack.
According to a report published Saturday by a report by the Alaska State Police of 29-year-old Peilina from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged that he prevented reports of the violence and resisted during his arrest.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Peilin is in custody in the Matanuska-Susitna detention facility with the right to make a pledge of $ 500.
He put trial on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when asked if he pleaded guilty, reported online.
Peilin is accused of three class A offenses, which provides for an arrest for up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of class B misconduct, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Peilin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence as well as that he prevented reports of domestic violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol intoxication when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Peilin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son's brutal behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused a tsunami: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications and power supply networks are out of operation, and the number of victims may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of Sulawesi Island, located northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
The video distributed on social networks shows the moment when the element hit.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of Palu, when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspect in New York attack
In New York, federal accusers are demanding the death penalty of Saifullo Saipov, suspected of a New York attack that killed eight people — a rare sentence that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov driving a rented Home Depot pickup ride along the highway in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began shooting down cyclists and pedestrians who happened to him on the way.
According to the report of intent to achieve execution filed in the Southern District of New York State to justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Saipov “intendly” killed eight persons and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm.
According to court materials, each of these points of the charge provides for the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Jury Court filed charges on 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, which is usually federal accusers in cases related to organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to the accusers, who described the crime committed by Saipov as “horrible, cruel and malicious”, this attack is the result of “careful planning and pre-considered intent.”
The victims of Saifulla Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, harmed or killed were Diego Enrique Angelina, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as described in the report.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time in the Southern District of New York City was violated by a criminal case that is punishable by the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for a federal case was led to execution in New York in 1953. A couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after being convicted of conspiring for espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to forensic materials, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate remorse in the days and months after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he did not regret what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to conduct an ISIS video attack that he was watching on his phone.
Police say he also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital ward.
He pleaded not guilty of charges on 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by such a prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting guilt and condemn life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only exacerbate the psychological trauma of all victims caused by these events,” Patton said.
The defense party Saipov has also asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.

During the protest at the Conservative Party Congress, Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army.”
Former leader of the Independence Party of the United Kingdom said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, as one of the deputies of parliament Theresa May offered his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party MP Peter Bown said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have “already come out” if Mr. Farage were Brexit secretary.
Attention to the problems May faced, trying to reconcile her deeply split ranks, further attracted the fact that MPs from the Conservative Party, who oppose the exit, joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to implement the Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
Allies insist that it will not leave attempts to negotiate with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and will force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between what she offers and the “chaos”.
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihal, Mr. Bown said he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He invited Mr. Farage to get out of the shadows and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible for that, we would have already left out,” he said.
MP Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to abandon Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We fought in world wars not to obey.
We want to pass our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion changed: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and do not want to come out is absolutely not true.”
Conservative Party member Andrea Jenkins, a member of Brexit, who was also on the march, told reporters, "I'm just saying, 'Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists who actually walk the streets and fight for the votes of voters.
Please reject Chequers and start listening."
In an address to Theresa May, she added: “Prime ministers keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians should "feel pressure" if they are going to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it is a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to say it won’t get out of their hands.”
In a message to the enthusiasm of the crowd, he added: “I want our political elite, which plans to betray the idea of Brexit, feel pressured.
We will mobilize the people’s army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and never calm down until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved “Conservators v. Brexit” banners after the group launched this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives because after the conference opened through their party program, security issues arose.
“These are people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland,” he said.
“It’s a full farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “seriously think” about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously think about running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during a general meeting in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about her future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, runs in November for a second term against Republican Party member Jeff Dil, who co-chair of Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is seen as the main candidate that can compete with Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a general meeting since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren replied that "it's time for women to go to Washington and establish the work of the government, and for this there should be a woman at his head."
Suspect in the murder of firearms basketball player “LSYu Tigers” Sims
Police at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Police Department Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dieton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. East time.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting asking to help recognize the person on him.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the campus of the University of Souterna on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims was injured in the head and died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was found that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, had weapons with him and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton County Police Office.
Sims, which was 6 feet and 6 inches tall and who performed in the Junior League, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 stars last season and spent an average of 17.4 minutes per game, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton reduced the lag in the fight for the world title after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Walttery Bottas left Lewis Hamilton behind Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes' team decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well with pole position and almost bypassed Hamilton, who tried to hold his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the race tail, which had to solve everything.
The Mercedes team pilot drove another circle and went behind Fettel, but Hamilton broke out into the leaders after a certain maneuver of the wheel to the wheel, resulting in a Ferrari driver reluctantly leaving the inner space due to the risk that he was clamping, after he managed to break forward in the third turn as a result of a double maneuver.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of the grid and remained in seventh place until the end of the first circle.
Pots he led most of the race because he did not change the tires to quickly come to the finish line and shift Kimi Raikkonen from fourth place.
As a result, he stopped at the pit stop on the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace by the last eight, so that Raikkonen took fourth place.
“It’s a difficult day because Valtteri taught full all weekend and showed nobility when it gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an exceptional job to take first and second place,” Hamilton said.
Body language was not impressive.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm stance that she did not disclose the contents of the letter by Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanano of sexual violence.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Law Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which he said demonstrated human "substity, vileness and lies."
“The only thing that could happen, and everything wonderful that’s happening in the last few days in the Senate is anger, you see evil people who show meanness, vileness and lies,” he said.
“You look at publications and disclosed information, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose the information?
Remember her answer... did you disclose the content of the documents? - "What?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose."
Wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t disclose,” he added, copying the behavior of the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing of charges brought by Ford against Kavanaugh, and in early September his content was announced, but Finestein denied that the leak of information had occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t disclose the information received from her,” Feinstein said in a statement.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I didn’t break the promises.”
However, her objections did not seem to like the president, who commented during the Saturday rally: "I will tell you, her body language did not impress at all.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but I haven’t seen anyone stay worse yet.”
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate who was accused of sexual violence, the president suggested that Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power in any necessary way.
You see meanness, vileness, they don’t care who to offend, through whom you need to step over, to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" - "Belfast Giants", 5:3
Giants player Patrick Duyer threw two goals in a match against Dundy
Dundy Stars was rehabilitated for Friday defeat in the elite league from Belfast Giants, winning a 5:3 match on Saturday.
The Jants gained an early advantage in two goals thanks to Patrick Duyer's throws and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney equalized the score in the home match, and then Duyer again brought the "Jiants" forward.
Dandy player Francois Bushar equalized the score, and two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen ensured their victory.
This is the third season of the elite league defeat of Adam Keif's team, which won a strong-willed victory over Dundy with a score of 2-1 on Friday in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season. Three previous matches were won by the Giants team.
The first puck Duyer was thrown in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFall's transfer, and four minutes later, Boville, who received a puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period in the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan turned the owners of the field into the game, and in the sixteenth minute (15:16) Cooney, receiving a puck from Matt Markwardt, equalized the score.
Duyer secured the "Jiants" advantage before the first break, throwing his second puck at the end of the first period.
The owners of the fields regrouped, and Bushar in the twenty-eighth minute (27:37) again equalized the score, throwing the puck when his team largely prevailed.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen first brought Dandy forward at the end of the second period and ensured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants team, which has already lost four of the last five matches, will play a away match against Milton Kines.
Air traffic controller dies so hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped take off the plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people died and much went missing after a strong earthquake that caused a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong tremors continue to shake the area, many people were under the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues, who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonion Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the dispatching tower, which was heavily dispersed, at Mutiar SyS airport Al-Jufrey in Palu.
He stayed on the spot to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was at the time on the runway, was safely climbed into the air.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian aeronautical service provider spokesman Johannes Sirite said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which is to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sorry to hear about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, as the country’s disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims can grow as many bodies are still under debris, and many of them cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves, which reached six meters high, devastated the city of Palu, in which mass burials will be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have experienced this tragedy, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joco Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and appealed to the country's military personnel: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on Lombok Island earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
The plane crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the plane fell into the lagoon, one man disappeared
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person was missing, although it has previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was drowning.
Air Niugini said that as of Saturday day it is not possible to find one passenger.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and for this purpose cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, for example, about his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and the team after the plane fell into the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday they had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low above the ground.
“That’s very good,” Janes said.
Janes said he and others managed to go to emergency exits on a sinking plane while on a belt in the water.
He said the stewardes had panicd and shouted, and that he had suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working nearby to modernize the pier also helped in a rescue operation, delivering people ashore with an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in plane crashes related to PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
The analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an operational development expert for several hours.
He told the jury how he used records from a mobile phone to recreate the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett, according to The Clarion Ledger, said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers that night she died contrary to his previous claim.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified and stated that he was not in the city that day.
When the accusers asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pickup that night, Sanford said he was "a lie because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed the text messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Gale said.
The defense must set out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the process to be passed on to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
The trio of hip-hop artists wants to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed group of Bristol claims that hip hop has changed its nature - has departed political ideas and struggle to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the origins and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently witnessed the revival of this direction in the United Kingdom through groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit for a couple for release, receiving a "racist" message
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for discriminatory release after receiving an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was "another black."
The couple denies that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit with "exhaustion".
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who came for her first working day in 2016, black.
“No, ONE TEMNOSHKIRA,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "inconvenient" and fired Miss Maurice. She stated that their previous nanny, who was African-American, did her job poorly and that instead she expects a nanny from the Philippines.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice is filing a couple in court, hoping to receive a refund for the pay he would receive for six months of working with the marriage she was originally hired, albeit without a contract. She had to be paid $350 a day.
“I want to show them that you don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday and added, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to accusations that they were racist, the couple said Maurice's release was a reasonable decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her.
She's not racist.
We are not racist,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children with a person who was treated rudely, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your baby?
THE NIGHT."
Comparing the lawsuit with "exhaustion", Plasco said his wife gave birth to a child only two months ago and "has not yet recovered."
Would you take revenge on someone after that?
This is a bad thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As told in a new letter, Padington publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea with a bear who is able to speak
Bond’s daughter Karen Yankel, born almost immediately after the book agreed to print, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s funny now because we know about the huge success that Padington’s story has gained.”
Speaking that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before a small toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, optimistically concerned that his work was rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release at the same time felt "joy and sadness", because his father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
“He was a pretty modest man and didn’t like to boast,” she said.
“But Padington was so real for him as his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although these are not theirs, not our victories.
I think he was looking at Padington's success.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to 2 Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
“I called it regularly, said that everything was really bad, that she shouldn’t have done it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
“And then Over called me and said she would die within the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.”
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually ceased to act and leave the body.
She died a while before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was happening at this time.
I couldn’t bother, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold myself in your hands.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was burning due to the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane along with other passengers, without paying attention to the harsh tests she had to survive.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I lowered my head and couldn’t hold back my tears.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to deeply sympathize with Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women who have been burned leave postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave cards on Welsh bridge with phone numbers that people can seek support, as well as messages that would inspire them.
Miss Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same as I do every day,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
“Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said that smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid it's going to have consequences."
Miss Davis created postcards "so that people know there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t be locked in yourself, you have to talk.”
Miss Humphries, who had been friends with Miss Davis for years, lost her husband Mark, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, that he was depressed or like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that it had changed.”
And on Christmas Day, he finally became discouraged. When the children opened their gifts, he did not look them into the eye or anything.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must survive it: "It put it destructive
I should be on the family.
But we must continue to live on and fight.”

Brett Kavanano's future hangs in the hair: FBI begins an investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we asked for — limited in the time and nature of the investigation — we might have reached some agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee is “breaking” against the background of a hopeless loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is related to time.
Intermediate elections will be held in just five weeks, November 6. If Republicans are expected to have problems, this will seriously complicate their attempts to hold their own person through elections to the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called senators asking for support Mr. Kavano, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and thanks to which he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting, a vote will be held.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to receive at least 50 votes at a Senate meeting, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the position of Supreme Court judge.
During Kim’s reign, the number of North Korean defectors “shortened”
After Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea declined, South Korean legislator said.
Park Pion Seug, citing data from the Ministry of Association of the Republic of South Korea, said last year the number of defectors was 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were increased border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers carrying illegal immigrants are now demanding more money for it.
Pyongyang has refrained from public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed denuclearization issues, negotiations on which went into the dead end.
This happened after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho on Saturday accused the US of lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be confident in the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no talk about unilateral disarmament,” Ri Yong-Ho said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanano "hysterical" and says he is not suitable for working in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanano "hysterical" and said he was not suitable for working in the Supreme Court by temperament.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I thought all the time that if a woman ever acted in this way, she would be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavanano’s testimony before the Senate Law Committee on Thursday.
Kavanano emotionally denied allegations of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening word, Kavano behaved very emotionally, sometimes almost screaming and coughed off, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned Democrats to the committee, calling the charges against him "absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation", organized by liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kawano’s testimony proved that he cannot work in the Supreme Court, as this showed his prejudice towards Democrats.
“I think with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and Democrats, he will withdraw his own candidacy,” she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to announce Kavano impeachment if his guilt was confirmed, and whether the Democrats would receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not only good to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
Kawano is currently a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about possible decisions by Kavano against the Affordable Medical Care Act or Row v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of approval in office, Kavano bypassed the question of whether he would cancel some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time when the judge will be an hysterical, biased person and we will say how wonderful that is,” Pelosi said.
Women must own these weapons.
These are just words that contained accumulated for months and years of rage, and she could not pronounce them without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something unusual, and you?"
She continued: "One woman who worked as an executive director somewhere and helped me a lot, said that she also cries when she got angry, but she had her own technique. When she was angry and started crying, told the interlocutor: "You might think that I am sad and because of that I am crying.
I am evil.”
And after that, she just continued.
I thought it was incredible.”
Tears are considered a permissible way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my most clear memories of the first work in the office, which worked mostly in men, was a situation when I cried from indescribable anger, and the older woman - an inhospitable manager, whom I was always a little afraid of - grabbed me behind the collar and pulled me to the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They will think you are sad and rejoice that you have reached you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an extramarital connection on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with laughter in 30 years.
“seven other candidates have already participated in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed.”
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she retired in fundraising, so she made a promise that she would not participate in the race if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters who did not regret $1,000 in support of men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll be given a discount?” she was surprised.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system, which made it very difficult to collect money and forced to focus not as much as members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as anger for sexism. She was ready to cry.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms Schroeder recalls the press reaction.
You would think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
“She cried?”
How a trade war between the US and China could bring benefits to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and although still far from its completion, in the long term, the split between the countries could benefit Beijing.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The largest situation escalated this week due to new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which actually taxes half of all goods that come to the United States from China.
Beijing paid off the same coin every time, recently imposing a duty of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to take similar US measures, and the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to miss the opportunity to keep that promise in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat is to agree with the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, the public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, as experts believe, if Beijing takes advantage of the situation correctly, pressure in the trade war with the United States could bring China an advantage in the long term, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
“A quick political solution in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic fall in any country. And that actually poses a greater threat than observers have previously recognized,” said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria 'ready' to return refugees
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and seek help in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave through terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that influenced their daily lives and limited their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian government would be pleased to accept assistance in restoring the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the riot.
Europe consolidates victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, when it defeated the US team with a final score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup tournament here since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who tried most of the tournament, broke his first long-range blow on the 16th hole of steam-3 into the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has won all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever been held with a score of 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated with a score of 5:4 from the player with the lowest rating in the European team of Turbiern Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who ranks first in the world ranking, lost to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup tournament for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Ryder Cup, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, became the European, who has won the most times in tournaments for all time, bringing 25.5 points during his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It is a merit of the team, and I am happy to be able to help,” said, without restraining emotions, Garcia after winning Europe.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Rem, who on Sunday defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods in a single game with a score of 2: 1.
“I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Ram said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record for the Ryder Cup tournament 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the most outstanding players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team tried all weekend to reach the queen zone, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-end golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furik said of his team after a disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we dominated Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We regroup, I will work with the U.S. Professional Golf Players Association and the Ryder Cup tournament committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You can't help but praise them.
We lost.”
