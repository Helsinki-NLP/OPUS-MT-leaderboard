The protest organizers said 100,000 people came out in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
Police estimate that there are 6,500 participants at the protest in Berlin.
The protests also took place in Paris, Sofia (Bulgaria), Vilnius (Lithuania), Valetti (Malta), Tallinn (Estonia), Edinburgh and Glasgow (Scotland).
About 200 people protested near the offices of major copyright holders in London.
Last month, mass protests took place in Poland when the country signed the TUPC, leading to the fact that the Polish government decided not yet to ratify the agreement.
Latvia and Slovakia postponed the process of joining the TUPK.
The Animal Liberation Organization and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (KTZZPT) again call for the mandatory installation of surveillance cameras on all Australian slaughterers.
New South Wales’s chief inspector David O'Schennessy told the ATC that surveillance and verification of slaughter sites should become commonplace in Australia.
“The video surveillance system will certainly remind people who work with animals that animal welfare is the highest priority.”
If you believe this international map of the earthquakes of the US Geological Survey, in the previous week of earthquakes in Iceland was not recorded.
Iceland’s Meteorological Office has also reported no seismic activity in the Hecla area over the past 48 hours.
Significant seismic activity that led to a phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's caldera.
At the foot of the mountain were found dark clouds not associated with volcanic activity.
Clouds were likely to be confused about whether an eruption really happened.
The moon had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board when he crashed, and strong winds and waves threw it into the wave.
The helipters rescued twelve crew members, and the broken nose became the only damage.
The 100-meter ship was on the road to pick up its standard fertilizer cargo, and initially officials feared that the ship could shed cargo.
The proposed amendment was already adopted by both chambers in 2011.
The change was made by this legislative session when the second sentence was first removed by the House of Representatives and then passed in a similar form in the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban same-sex civil unions, could theoretically open the door to civil unions in the future.
Following this process, a joint resolution under the symbol HJR-3 will be revised again by the next elected legislature in 2015 or 2016, regarding its abandonment in action.
Among the achievements of Votier, in addition to directing, we can mention the 1973 famine against what he considered political censorship.

Carno is a well-known but controversial English tutor who taught on behalf of Moder Educeing and Kings Glory, and stated that at the peak of his career he had 9,000 students.
In his notes, he used words that some parents considered rude, and also, as noted, he used profanity in class.
The School of Modern Education accused him of placing large advertisements on buses without permission, as well as lies that he is the chief tutor in English.
He was also accused of violating intellectual rights, but was not charged.
The former student said he used slang classes, taught him to go on a date on notes, and was simply a friend of the students.
Over the past three decades, despite the fact that China officially remained a communist state, it has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Dan Xiaopin.
China’s economy has grown 90 times since then.
For the first time in all time, China exported more cars than Germany in the past year, and outpaced the United States as the largest market in the industry.
China’s GDP could be larger than the GDP of the United States in two decades.
Tropical storm Daniel, the fourth storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum steady wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists from the National Hurricane Center predict that Daniel will gain hurricane power to Wednesday.
As the hurricane is far from land, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in the capital of Croatia, Zagreb, Bobek gained his fame by playing for Belgrade's Partizan.
He joined them in 1945 and played in their composition until 1958.
When he was on the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
No one has ever gone out more times or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995, he was elected the best player in Partizan history.
The celebration began with a special show of the world-famous Circus du Soley.
Then the example was taken by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, the Janicar ensemble and singers Fatih Erkoch and Muslum Gurses.
Then came on the stage, the barns that rotated.
Turkish pop diva Cesen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexio.
In conclusion, the Turkish dance group The fire of Anatolia performed the dance performance "Troya".

He was immediately examined by full-time doctors and taken to a local hospital, where he later died.
The police were not injured during the incident.
As for the financial situation in the world, Sapatero continued, saying that "the financial system is part of the economy, the most important part of it.
We are experiencing a financial crisis that has been going on for a year and has escalated in the last two months, and I think that now financial markets are beginning to recover.”
Last week, Ogolen News announced that they would greatly increase their demands for news reporting in international communication languages, with three new broadcasters.
Already broadcasting in English and Japanese, this world organization launches language programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, the Internet and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a creepy scene when people tried to break the windows to get out.
People beat the window spike chairs, but the windows could not be broken.
"One window glass finally broke and they began to climb through the window," said the victim Franzishek Koval.
Stars emit light and heat due to the energy that is formed when hydrogen atoms drain (or alloy) together and form heavier elements.
Scientists are working on creating a reactor that can extract energy in the same way.
However, this problem is very difficult to solve, and it will take many years before we witness the construction of suitable thermonuclear reactors.
The steel needle is kept on the surface of the water through the surface tension.
The surface tension occurs because the water molecules on its surface are tied to each other much stronger than to air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible film on its surface, which allows objects such as a needle to swim on the surface of the water.
The blade on a modern slide has double edges and a concave exit between them. The two edges provide better ice grip even during inclination.
Since the lower part of the blade is slightly curved when the blade leans in one side or the other, the edge that has contact with the ice bends.
This allows the slide to turn. If the skates are tilted to the right, the slide returns to the right if the skates are tilted to the left, the slide returns to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the excess energy received from the light.
They do this by emitting a small piece of light called "photon".
Scientists call this process "stimulated radiation" because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing photon light radiation, and light is a type of radiation.
The next image depicts atoms that emit photons. Of course, in fact, photons are much smaller than in this picture.
Photons are even less than what atoms are made of!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the spiral in the light bulb eventually burns, and the light bulb no longer works.
Then the lamp needs to be replaced. When replacing the lamp, you need to be careful.
First, you need to disable the lighting device switch or disconnect the cable.
This is because the electric current directed to the cartridge of the light bulb where its metal part is located can cause you a strong electric shock if you touch the inside of the cartridge or the metal base of the light bulb when it is still in the cartridge.
The main organ of the cardiovascular system is the heart that pumps blood.
Blood leaves the heart through the tubes called the artery, and returns back to the heart through the tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
Triceratops teeth could crush not only leaves, but also even strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceraptors ate sag palm - a plant common in the Cretaceous period.
These plants are similar to small palm trees with sharp barbed leaves at the top.
Triceratops could use its strong beak to tear off the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists suggest that these plants are extremely poisonous, so it is unlikely that their dinosaurs were eaten, although even today lazy and other animals, such as parrots (descendant of dinosaurs) eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would Io's gravity affect me? Standing on the surface of Io, you will weigh less than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. Therefore, gravity, of course, attracts you less.
The sun has no crust like the Earth on which you can stand. It is entirely made up of gases, fire and plasma.
The further from the center of the Sun, the layer of gas is thinner.
The outer part we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei saw that Venus, like the Moon, had three phases.
Phases are because only the side of Venus (or moon) is illuminated, returned to the Sun. Venus' phases support Copernicus' theory that planets orbit the Sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrox observed the passage of Venus.
After Danelag's conquest in England, lasting peace came.
However, in 991, Ethelred faced a Viking fleet larger than any other since Gutrum a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Truggwason, a Norwegian with ambitions to free his country from Danish rule.
After initial military failures, Ethelred was able to negotiate with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to conquer his kingdom with variable success.
Hangil is the only specially created alphabet that is in everyday use. Alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Segjon (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Josion Dynasty and is one of the highest regarded.
He originally called Hangil Hongmin Yonggeum, meaning "right sounds to control people."
There are many theories about how Sanskrit originated. One of them concerns the migration of the Aryans from the west to India, which brought their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language, it can be compared to Latin in Europe.
The oldest of the books known in the world was written in Sanskrit. Sanskrit's language disappeared due to the hierarchy after the conclusion of Upanishad.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that has become the source of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin was the source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
When the battle for France ended, Germany began preparations for the capture of Britain.
Germany called the attack codenamed Operation Sea Lion. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and food were lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Krigsmarine") and could defeat any fleet that could invade the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were located near-probable invasion routes, as Admirals feared they would be sunk by German air strikes.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plans. Mainly, Italy was the "younger brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker fleet, although it built four new ships before the war began.
Italy's main goals were African countries. To capture these countries, they would need a springboard for troops so that troops could cross the Mediterranean Sea and enter Africa.
To do this, they needed to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Italian warships no longer had to do anything but these actions.
Now about Japan. Japan was an island state, as was Britain.
Submarines are vessels designed to move underwater and stay there for a long time.
Submarines were used during the First and Second World Wars. Then they were very slow and had a very limited range of shooting.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled on the sea surface, but as radars began to develop and become more accurate, submarines were forced to dive under water so they would not be noticed.
German submarines were called U-Boats. The Germans were very well aware of navigation and control of their submarines.
Because the Germans carried out successful operations on submarines, after the war they were not trusted to have them in large numbers.
Yes! Pharaoh Tutankhamun, sometimes called the "Faraon Tuth" or "faraon boy", is one of the most famous pharaohs of ancient Egypt today.
Interestingly, in ancient times it was not considered especially important, and was not noted in most lists of ancient pharaohs.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. Although many burials of the past were robbed, this tomb remained virtually unbridled.
Most of the things buried with Tutanhamon are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
After the invention of the wheels with knitting needles, Assyrian chariots became easier, faster and better prepared to overtake soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of opponents. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians formed the first cavalry.
Cavalry is a military unit that fights horses. Sidlo has not yet been invented by that time, so Assyrian cavalry fought on naked backs of horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most popular person belonging to this culture is Homer, a legendary blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poem "Iliad" and "Odysseus".
The dramaturgues Sophocles and Aristophane are still popular, and their plays are among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, known mainly for his famous theorem on the ratio of sides of the correct triangle.
There are different calculations of how many people speak Hindi. It is located between the second and fourth most used languages in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether closely related dialects are taken into account.
An estimated 340 to 500 million are native speakers, and up to 800 million people can understand it.
Hindi and Urdu languages are similar in vocabulary, but are different in writing; in everyday communication, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under great cultural influence of Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the locals, so they invented Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet, and one symbol " ?/?" was added.
Later, many words borrowed from German began to mix. This was the beginning of the era of enlightenment.
Traditionally, after graduation, the heir to the throne immediately enters the army.
However, Charles entered the university at Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and then history, receiving 2:2 (lower second grade degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a degree.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) occupies 3% of the country's territory.
Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, and has an approximate rectangle shape.
The area of Turkey, including lakes, is 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are located in southwestern Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,74 sq. miles) are in Europe.
Turkey ranks 37th in the world in size, and is approximately equal to the metropolis of France and the UK combined.
On three sides, Turkey is surrounded by seas: from the west - Aegean, from the north - Black and from the south - Mediterranean.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence begins counting in 1839.
Belgium's current territories were previously part of Luxembourg, but came under Belgian control after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but was occupied by Germany both in World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the founders of the organization today known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a destroyed fortress and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro district (in the village of Fonda).
In 1649, Jabdrung Ngawang Namgyal built a fortress in honor of his victory over Tibetan-Mongolian troops.
Due to the 1951 fire, only some Druckgiel Dzong relics remained, such as images of Shabdrung Ngwang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining one of Bhutan's most sensational monuments.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was squeezed between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, the Thais conquered Cambodia several times, and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Penh.
In the last years of the 18th century, Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans have no job, and most of those who have work in the field of informal economics.
Two-thirds of Venezuela’s employed population works in the service sector, almost a quarter of it works in the industrial sector, agriculture is engaged in the fifth part.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil production, in which the country is a net exporter, although only 1 percent of the population works in the oil industry.
At the beginning of the country's independence, the knowledge and experience of Singapore's botanical garden helped to turn the island into a tropical garden city.
In 1981, Wanda Miss Hoaquim, an orchid hybrid, was chosen as the country's national flower.
Every year, around October, about 1.5 million herbivores travel from the northern hills to the southern plains by rain, crossing the Mara River.
And then they return north through the west, again crossing the Mara River, after rains falling around April.
The Serengeti region includes Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Nature Territory and Masva Reserve in Tanzania, as well as the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media content requires generally accepted and traditional skills, as well as techniques studied in interactive classes (discarding, editing audio and video, stories, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to overestimate your ideas about media production and learn to think nonlinearly.
Interactive design requires that the components of the project be combined and at the same time make sense as separate units.
The disadvantage of variable focal length lenses is that the difficulty of focus and the number of optical system lenses needed to achieve a range of focal distances are much larger than in lenses with constant focal length.
This problem gradually disappears, as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards of their manufacture.
This allowed zoom lenses to create photos in quality comparable to the one achieved by lenses with constant focal length.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
Because of this, inexpensive vario lenses are difficult to use in conditions of poor lighting without flash.
One of the most common problems during the conversion of the film to the DVD format is the border.
Most TVs are made to please the general public.
That’s why everything you see on TV has cropped boundaries on top, bottom and side.
This is done to make the image covers the entire screen. This is called a deployment.
Unfortunately, when creating the DVD, the edges of the video are most likely to be cut, and if the video contained subtitles too close to the lower edge, they will not be displayed completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long been an inspiration, causing scenes of fights, banquets and knights of Arthur in the imagination.
Even standing among the thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to imagine the long-forgotten sounds and smells of battles, almost hear the knocker on the paving stones and feel the fear that rises with the pit of the dungeon.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were locks originally built? How were they designed and built?
Typical for that period, Kirby Maxlo Castle is rather a fortified house, not a real castle.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not be able to resist a decisive attack for long.
In 1480, when Lord Hastings began its construction, the country was relatively calm, and protection was needed only from small groups of nomadic looters.
The balance of power was a system in which European states tried to maintain the state sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea was that all European nations should make sure that one nation becomes powerful, and thus national governments often changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war, the main issue of which was the ratio of forces.
This marked an important change, because European forces no longer had a reason to wage religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War was the last war called religious.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC as a result of the arson of the Herostrat.
According to this story, his motivation was fame for every cost. The epezian, angry, announced that the name of Gerostrat would never be recorded.
Greek historian Strabon later recorded the name, so we know it today. The temple was destroyed on the same night when Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander as king offered funds for the restoration of the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was restored in 323 BC.
Relax your hand as much as possible, while still pressing the right keys, so try not to make unnecessary movements with your fingers.
So you will get tired much less. Remember that you do not need to press the keys with great effort to get extra sound like on the piano.
On the accordion, to achieve a larger volume, you need to use bags with greater pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the search for community with, identity from or conscious perception of the highest reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks direct experience, sense or understanding of divine reality/godliness or deities.
Followers follow certain ways of life or customs aimed at feeding such experience.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious beliefs and worship by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially the experience of a calm, insightful, blessed or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It was founded during the 15th century in the Punjab region as a result of confessional separation from the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith separate religion from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjab means "the path of guru". Guru is a fundamental concept of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has become of particular importance, and forms the basis of Sikh beliefs.
This religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539). It was followed by the next nine gurus.
However, in June 1956, Khrushchev’s promises were tested when unrest in Poland, where workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev sent tanks to restore order at the end, he did satisfy certain economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Vladislav Gomluk as a new Prime Minister.
The Indus civilization is a Bronze Age civilization in the northwest Indian subcontinent, covering most of modern-day Pakistan, as well as some areas in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the Indus River basin, where its name comes from.
Although some scientists suggest that since civilization also existed in the basins of the now dried Sarasvati River, it would be correct to call it the Hindu-Sarasvat civilization, others call it the Harappan civilization, by the name Harappa, the first place where it was discovered in the 1920s.
The militarization of the Roman Empire contributed to success in the development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began hiring doctors and even created the first Roman Medical Corps to provide assistance after the battles.
Surgeons have known a variety of sedatives, including morphine from poppy seed extracts and scopolamine from herbal seeds.
They perfectly mastered amputation to save patients from gangrene, as well as harnesses and arterial clamps to stop bleeding.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved great success in the field of medicine and formed a significant part of the knowledge known to us today.
Simple origami is a technique that allows you to do only one bend at a time. More complex bends like the reverse are prohibited, in addition, all bends should be performed in direct places.
John Smith developed it in the 1970s to help inexperienced origami or people with limited motor skills.
Children learn about races and racial stereotypes quite early and such racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who belong to racial minorities, about whom there are stereotypes about poor school education, tend to learn poorly when they learn about such stereotypes.
MySpace is the most popular website used in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These sites were given a lot of attention, especially in the education system.
There are also positive aspects of these websites, which include the ability to easily configure a class page covering blogs, videos, photos and other materials.
Access to this page can be easily obtained by entering only one Internet address, making it easy to remember and easily recruit students who may have problems using keyboard or spelling.
It can be configured so that it is easy to read, and you can also add as many colors as needed.
Attention deficit syndrome is "this is a neurological disorder, to the classic triad of symptoms of which include impulsiveness, distraction and hyperactivity or excessive energy."
This is not a violation of learning ability, it is a learning ability disorder; it "compasses from 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children."
Children with ADHD find it difficult to focus on things like school tasks, but they may focus on things they like to do, how to play games, or watch their favorite cartoons, or write sentences without sectional signs.
Such children tend to often get into trouble because they “take risky behavior, arrange fights, and do not listen to elders” to stimulate their brain, as this cannot be done in the usual ways.
The ADHD affects relationships with other peers because other children don’t understand why they behave or communicate like this, and that their maturity level is different.
As the ability to gain knowledge has changed and learn in this way, as mentioned above, the basic speed of knowledge acquisition has changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There was no more emphasis on personal recall, but the focus included the ability to recall text.
The Renaissance has significantly changed the approach to learning and disseminating knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use hands to move, carry weights or pump on trees.
The hands and legs of chimpanzees are similar in size and length, indicating the use of hands to carry weight during walking on four limbs.
The human hand is shorter than the leg, with more straight phalangs.
Fossiled hand bones aged two to three million years indicate a functional transition from the ability to move hands to skillful control of them.
Some people believe that experiencing many artificially caused by conscious dreams too often can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that conscious dreams extend the length of time between the stages of fast sleep.
With fewer stages of fast sleep overnight, this condition in which you experience a real sleep and your body is recovering becomes frequent enough to make it a problem.
It’s as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to consciously see dreams overnight.
In North Africa, Italian affairs were not set almost from the beginning. Within a week after Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussar Regiment captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In a ambush east of Bardi, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian tenth army, General Lastucci.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and the direct heir to Mussolini, was killed by friendly fire during a landing in Tobruka.
Fencing as a modern sport is engaged at many levels, from students at universities to professionals, as well as at the Olympic Games.
In this sport, they mostly play in duel format when one fencing another.
Golf is a game in which players use keys to score balls in holes.
The usual round covers eighteen holes. Players usually start with the first hole and finish on the eighteenth.
The player who makes the most strokes, or attempts with a cushion to complete the course, wins.
The game takes place on the grass. The grass around the hole is cut shorter and called Green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
It’s when people go to a place that doesn’t look like their lifetime at all in order to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and camping places are most often the most visited tourists traveling for pleasure.
If the purpose of a visit to a certain place is to familiarize yourself with its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different prominent places of a particular country, or can simply focus on only one area.
Seeing these actions, the colonists also caused reinforcements.
The troops that strengthened the advanced positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments, which numbered 200 people under the command of Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's people took positions along the particle on the northern edge of the position of the colonists.
When the outflow exposed the gap in the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall towards the north, which ended on the edge of water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark put a pillar of about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one shoot until regular troops pass by it.
The American plan provided for coordinated attacks from 3 different directions.
General John Cadwalder would launch a distraction on the British garrison in Bordentown to close the path for reinforcement.
General James Ewing intended to transfer 700 militias on the Trenton ferry across the river, occupy the bridge through Assunpink Bay, and prevent the enemy's troops from fleeing.
A major assault group of 2,400 people crossed the river nine miles north of Trenton and then broke into two groups — one under Greene command, one under Sullivan command — in order to go on the offensive before dawn.
With the transition to races from quarter to half a mile, the speed begins to play a much smaller role, but endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class runner half a mile - a person who can run faster than two minutes - should have enough speed, but also extremely need to develop endurance.
Running in a crossed area in winter combined with upper body training is the best preparation for the running season.
It is only proper nutrition that will not help to achieve good results, but can significantly affect the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective water drinking habits, and understanding a variety of aspects of supplement use can help athletes improve their results and increase their satisfaction from sports.
Medium-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions about several elements of equipment needed to participate.
If necessary, you can purchase equipment elements, but most of them will either have a minor or will have no real impact on the result.
Athletes can choose a product, even if it does not have real advantages.
Atom can be considered one of the main components of all matter.
It is a very complex unit that, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central nucleus around which electrons rotate, which is somewhat similar to planets orbiting the Sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, and neutrons do not have charge. Electrons are charged negatively.
Before you inspect the victim, first make sure it is safe there.
When approaching the injured person, it is necessary to assess the place and determine any alarming points.
If you hurt yourself, trying to help, you will only worsen the situation.
The study found that depression, fear, and disaster acted as intermediaries between pain and disabilities in people suffering from lower back pain.
The effects of disaster, not depression or fear, depended on regular weekly structured physical education classes.
Those who are engaged in regular physical activity need additional support in terms of negative perception of pain, which allows you to distinguish chronic pain and a feeling of discomfort from normal physical movement.
Vision, or ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.
There are many different eye designs that vary in complexity depending on the needs of the body.
Different structures have different capabilities sensitive to different wavelengths, have different degrees of sharpness, and also require different processing processes to understand the meaning of input information, and different quantities for optimal operation.
Population is a collection of organisms of a separate species within a given territory.
When all individuals in a population have a certain identical phenotypic rice, they are known as monomorphic.
When individuals show several variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
Colonies of traveling ants move and nest at different periods.
During the nomadic period, nomads march at night, and they stop in the camp during the day.
When the amount of food available decreases, the colony begins the nomadic period. During this period, the colony builds temporary nests that change daily.
Each of these nomadic buffs or marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word "cella" comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and for the first time this term was used by a microscopeist who studied the structure of the crust.
The cell is the main unit of all living beings, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and important to study life that they are often called "building bricks of life."
The nervous system supports homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to maintain good and unhindered blood circulation.
These nerve impulses pass through the body very quickly, which helps protect it from any potential threats.
Tornados hit a small area compared to other unsatiable storms, but they can destroy everything in their way.
Tornados tear out trees with the root, tear boards from houses and throw cars to the sky. The worst two percent tornadoes last more than three hours.
The wind speed in these monster hurricanes reaches 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
People have been making and using lenses to increase for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were created in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes combined two lenses to approach and at the same time increase distant objects.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and such a nature of cooperation that when the majority benefit, there will always be more benefits that can be obtained in a short time, acting selfishly.
I hope most people will understand that their best option in the long run is to work with others.
Many people dream of a day when people can travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people are interested in what is there, some believe that aliens or other life may exist on another planet.
But if this ever happens, it probably won't happen very long. Stars are so scattered that there are trillion miles between them that are "neighbors".
Maybe one day your great-grandchildren will stand on top of someone else’s world, thinking about their ancient ancestors?
Animals consist of many cells. They consume food and digest it in themselves. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (although not even all animals have; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
Animals are found all over the planet. They dig burrows in the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism (things).
The cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means a small room.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you can see that they are made up of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw small cells in a cork through a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to see dead cells.
Messages and elements can easily move from one state to another.
Nitrogen in a gaseous state still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. In a liquid state, it is thicker, but the molecules remain the same.
Another example is water. Water composition: two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure in a gaseous, liquid or solid state.
Although its physical condition may change, its chemical composition remains the same.
That’s what surrounds us and affects everything we do, but it’s difficult to understand.
For thousands of years, religious scholars, philosophers and scientists have been studying time.
We experience time as a number of events that pass from the future through the present to the past.
Time is also how we measure the duration (length) of events.
You can independently notice how time comes, watching the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens over and over again on a regular basis.
Today, computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
Complex animations can be created on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly used in television and film.
Music is often recorded using complex computers to process and build sounds.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, people believed that the first settlers in New Zealand were Maori people who hunted huge birds called moa.
Thus, the theory confirmed the idea that the Maori people the Great Fleet migrated from Polynesia and conquered New Zealand in the seaside by establishing agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Morori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to Chatham Islands, developing their own original peaceful culture.
Chatham had another tribe in the archipelago, it was a Maori who migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Morori, a few more clashes occurred, and eventually the Morori were destroyed.
People who have been involved for decades have helped us appreciate our benefits and passions by openly assessing difficulties and even failures.
By listening to how employees share personal, family and organization-related stories, we have gained valuable evidence of the past, as well as some individuals who have had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the organization.
Understanding your history doesn’t mean understanding culture, and yet it helps people feel where they are in the context of organization’s history.
In assessing success and failure detection, employees and all individuals involved more deeply discover the values, mission and driving forces of the organization.
In this case, the mention of previous examples of entrepreneurial behavior and achieved as a result of this success helped people to be open to new changes and a new direction of the local church.
Such success stories have reduced the fear of change, while creating positive settings for changes in the future.
Convergent thinking models are methods of solving problems that combine different ideas or industries to find a solution.
This type of thinking focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, and setting facts, re-approving existing techniques, and collecting information.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is that there is only one correct answer. You think about only two options for the answer, namely: correct or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with a particular science or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking and can remember patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
Humanity is the most talented species that can read the thoughts of others.
This means that we can successfully predict the perception, intentions, beliefs, knowledge or desires of others.
In addition to these abilities, it is extremely important to understand the intentions of other people. This allows us to understand the possible ambiguity of physical actions.
If you saw someone break the glass of a car, you would rather assume that this person is trying to steal someone else’s car.
It would be necessary to consider it differently if he lost his car keys, and it would be his own car, to which he tried to penetrate.
MRI is based on the physical phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (who worked at Stanford University) and Edward Percell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves force atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and research scientist, discovered the basics of using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was issued, which became the world’s first patent received in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadyan completed the creation of the first MRI scanner "for the whole body", which he called "Unbridled".
Asynchronous communication encourages you to devote time to reflections and reactions to others.
This gives students the opportunity to learn and receive information at their own pace and control it.
In addition, there are fewer time limits and there is a possibility of flexible work schedule (Bremer, 1998).
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web gives students the opportunity to access information at any time.
Instead of waiting for the next personal meeting, students can also ask instructors questions at any time during the day and expect a relatively quick answer.
Postmodern approach to learning offers freedom from absolute principles. There is no good way to learn.
In fact, there is no one good thing to learn. Learning is based on the interaction of the student and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all events and information, as well as television shows based on learning, illustrates this.
Many of us watch TV shows that inform us about a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We will never make major repairs of the car, we will not build a fountain in our back yard, we will not go to Peru to explore the ancient ruins, or rework the house of our neighbor.
With underwater fiber optic cable lines with Europe and broadband satellite television, Greenland has a good connection between 93% of the population with access to the Internet.
Your hotel or host (if you stay in a guest house or a private person) is likely to have a Wi-Fi or a computer with the Internet, and all settlements have an internet salon or space with free Wi-Fi.
As mentioned above, although the word "eskimos" remains acceptable in the United States, however, many Arctic peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada, consider it disrespectful.
This word can be heard from the mouth of the indigenous Greenland population, but it itself should not be used.
The indigenous people of Greenland call themselves innuites in Canada and Kalaalek (a multiplier of Kalaalite), i.e. a Greenlander, in Greenland.
Crime and ill-kind attitude towards foreigners as a whole in Greenland are actually unknown. Even in cities there are no "dark areas".
Cold weather is probably the only real danger for unprepared travelers.
If you visit Greenland in the cold season (the further you move north, the colder temperature awaits you), you need to take warm clothes with you.
Very long days in the summer can lead to sleep problems and appropriate health difficulties.
In the summer, also follow Scandinavian mosquitoes. Although they do not transmit any diseases, they can irritate.
San Francisco’s economy is influenced by the fact that the city is a tourist destination of global scale, but it is multi-industry.

Traveling to Walt Disney World is a major pilgrimage for many American families.
"Type" visits include arrival at Orlando International Airport, a bus trip to the Disney Hotel, a hopeless stay in the entertainment center for about a week and returning home.
There are many possible options, but this is what most people mean when talking about going to Disney World.
Many tickets sold online through auction sites, such as eBay or Craigslist, are partially used multi-day tickets to parks.
This practice is very common, but Disneyland prohibits it: you can not transfer tickets.
Any camping in the Grand Canyon below the ring requires permission to visit remote areas of the state.
To protect the canyon, there are restrictions on permits that become available on the first day of the month four months before the initial one.
Thus, permission to visit remote areas of the state at any start date becomes available on January 1.
Places in the most popular areas, such as Bright Angel Campbell Circle Fent Ranch, are mostly filled in the time of requests received on the first day of the booking start.
There are a limited number of permits that can be issued as an invitation to entrance, which are available on the principle of who came first, the first and served.
South Africa’s road journey is an amazing way to see the beauty of the region, as well as visit places outside the usual tourist routes.
This can be done on a regular car if you plan everything carefully, but very recommend 4x4, and in many places you can only reach 4x4 with a long wheelbase.
Keep in mind that although South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are so.
Visa requirements and expenses differ from country to country, and depend on where you came from.
Each country also has unique laws that set a list of essentials that should be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in western Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingston, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The town is located near waterfalls and they are the main tourist attraction; but this popular tourist destination offers both adventurers and fans of excursions many opportunities to stay for longer.
In the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water will be larger, and the waterfalls will be more impressive.
You will definitely shut down if you cross the bridge or walk through the slings that are winding next to the waterfalls.
On the other hand, just because the volume of water is so large, your own waterfall can be limited - all the water!
Tutankhamun's tomb (KV62). KV62, perhaps the most famous of the tombs in the Valley, the opening site by Howard Carter in 1922 of the nearly untouched royal burial of the young monarch.
However, compared to most of the other royal tombs, Tutankhamun’s grave is barely worth visiting, as it is much smaller and sadly decorated.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of damage caused by the mummy during attempts to remove it from the sarcophagus will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
The famous treasures of the tomb are no longer in it, but were moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors who have limited time are better to devote it to another place.
The edge is 12 km northwest of Siemreap. This temple on top of the hill was built in the late 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
On the slope should be torn out for the sake of the gloomy atmosphere of the castle and the landscape opening to Lake Tonlesap.
Traveling to the place can be conveniently combined with a walking lake in a boat.
On the way to the temple, you need to cross the Angkor Pass, so do not forget to capture a passport, going to Tonlesap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city in Israel, but most other countries and the UN do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.
The ancient city on the hills of Judah has an exciting history of thousands of years.
The city is sacred to three monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and acts as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Because of the religious significance of the city and, in particular, many attractions in the Old Town area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, as well as bright and crowded shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens with an invitation to enter Ecuador through international airports or border checkpoints.
This letter must be drawn up in accordance with certain requirements and legalized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador.
These requirements are designed to ensure an organized migration flow between the two countries.
Citizens of Cuba, who own a U.S. green card, need to visit the Ecuadorian Consulate to obtain exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the travel dates. To confirm the duration of the trip, a return ticket or a third country ticket is required.
For large groups, tours are cheaper, so if you travel alone or with one friend, try to find other people and form a group of four to six people to get the best price per person.
However, this should not really bother you, as often tourists are distributed so that they fill the cars.
In fact, it’s more like making people believe they need to pay more.
Over the northern edge of Machu Picchu, this steep mountain rises, and often becomes the background for numerous photographs of ruins.
It looks a little confusing below, it’s a cool and heavy lift, but most people in good physical shape would have to overcome it in about 45 minutes.
Most of the path is laid out by stone steps, and places with a steeper slope are equipped with steel cables that serve as additional handrails.
However, expect you won’t be able to breathe in the air and take care of steeper areas, especially when they are wet, as they can become dangerous in a short period of time.
At the top there is a tiny cave that must be passed, it is quite low and somewhat tight.
Visit the interesting things and see the wildlife of the Galapagos Islands best on a boat, taking the example of Charles Darwin in 1835.
More than 60 cruise liners with a capacity of 8 to 100 passengers carry out cruises on the Galapagos waters.
Most people reserve their seats in advance (since boats are usually filled in high season).
Make sure the agent you make a reservation through is a specialist from the Galapagos Islands who knows a variety of ships well.
This will ensure that your specific interests and/or restrictions comply with the vessel that suits them most.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule, while the indigenous Araukans (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
Mapuche was also one of the last independent Native groups of Americans, which did not absorb Spanish-speaking rule until Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (among the Napoleonic Wars that left Spain without a functional central government for several years), a decisive victory over Spain was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: Rep?blica Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that occupies the eastern half of the island of Espanyol, which it shares from Haiti.
In addition to white sand and mountain landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas, now part of Santo Domingo.
Taino and Caribs were the first settlers on the island. The Caribbean were a people who spoke Arabian languages and settled here around 10,000 BC.
For several short years since the arrival of European travelers, the Taino population was significantly reduced by Spanish conquerors.
According to Fry Bartome de las Casa (Tratado de las Indias), between 1492 and 1498 Spanish conquistadors killed at least 100,000 Tainos

It is an archipelago consisting of 15 islands that occupy 2.2 million square kilometers of the ocean.
Since the islands are in the same time zone with Hawaii, they are sometimes considered to be the "Gawayas of the Southern Hemisphere".
Although smaller, they remind some summer visitors to Hawaii before obtaining state status, without all these major tourist hotels and other development outcomes.
Cook Islands do not have a bridge, but consist of 15 different islands. The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, in developed countries, the provision of luxury services within the framework of "nichlig and breakfast" has reached the level of kind of art.

In short, it’s great to go on a trip by car, but it’s not a very good idea when traveling with tents.
Camping in the car is possible if you have a large minivan, eSUVI, sedan or minibus with seats that fall.
Some hotels have heritage since the heyday of steam railways and ocean liners; until World War II, in the 19th or early 20th centuries.
These hotels stopped rich and famous people of the time, and often enjoyed high cuisine and night entertainment there.
Old-fashioned devices, lack of modern amenities and a certain elegant antiquity are also part of their style.
Despite the fact that they are usually privately owned, sometimes they stop there with the visit of the head of state and other respected persons.
A traveler with a lot of money can think about flying around the world, divided by rest in many of these hotels.
A hospitality exchange network is an organization that connects travelers to locals in the cities they plan to visit.
To join such a network, it is usually enough to fill out an online form; although some networks offer or require an additional confirmation stage.

The World Fair (also known as the World Exhibition or simply Expo) is a major international festival of arts and sciences.
The participating countries demonstrate artistic and educational expositions in national pavilions to show the world's problems or culture and the history of their country.
International gardening exhibitions are specialized events at which flower expositions, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants are presented.
Although theoretically they can take place annually (as long as they are in different countries), in practice this does not happen.
Such measures in most cases stretch for three to six months and take place in places that have an area of at least 50 hectares.
There are many different film formats that have been used for years. Standard 35 mm film (negative 36 by 24 mm) is the most common.
If it is over, it can be replenished quite easily, and it gives a resolution roughly comparable to the current mirror camera.
Some medium-format film cameras use the format 6 by 6 cm, or rather negative 56 by 56 mm.
This gives almost four times more resolution than 35 mm of negative (3,136 square millimeters vs. 864).
Wildlife is one of the most challenging motives for a photographer, and requires talent, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photos are usually taken for granted, but as in photography in general, the picture is worth thousands of words.
To photograph wildlife, you often need to have a telephoto lens, however, to take pictures of a pack of birds or a small creature, you may need other lenses.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, and parks sometimes have rules for photography for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are over 5,000 different languages in the world, including over twenty languages spoken by 50 or more than millions of people.
Also written words are often easier to understand than pronounced. This is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to say legibly.
Many entire nations are fluent in English, and even more you can expect limited knowledge, especially among young people.
Imagine, for example, a mankunian, Boston, Jamaican and a saddler sitting at a table and having lunch at a Toronto restaurant.
They entertain each other with stories from their native cities, told with expressive accents and local jargon.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to feed. However, without the possibility of cooking, the choice is limited to finished food.
Supermarkets are increasingly expanding the choice in the departments with finished food. Some even provide a microwave oven or other means to heat food.

Make and carry copies of your policy and contact details of your insurer.
They should provide an email address and international phone numbers of the insurance company for advice/authorization or for filing complaints.
Keep another instance in your luggage and online (send it to your email address by attachments or download it to the "cloud").
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, store a copy in their memory or on your disk (available without the Internet).
Also provide copies of policies/contracts to satellites and relatives or friends who are at home and are ready to help.
The moose itself is not aggressive, but they will defend if they feel threatened.
If people don’t treat moose as a potential danger, they may get too close and put themselves at risk.
Drink alcoholic beverages moderately. Alcohol has a different impact on everyone, and it is very important to know your measure.
The possible prolonged effect of excessive alcohol consumption on health includes liver damage and even blindness and death. Potential danger increases if consumed illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal alcoholic beverages can contain various dangerous impurities, like methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be cheaper in other countries, especially in low-income countries, where wages are lower.

Families with young children may need more preparations, but a day in the fresh air is quite possible, even with infants and preschoolers.
There are about 200 organizations in the world that are engaged in running tours. Most of them work independently.
The successor of the World Running Tours, called Run Tours, unites dozens of run organizers in a single network with prominent places on four continents.
Since the organization was associated with Barcelona's Barcelona Big Tours and Copenhagen Big Copenhagen, it was quickly joined by Prague Big Tours and others.
There are many things to consider before and while traveling somewhere.
Be prepared for the fact that during the trip there will be a lot of things not like at home. Maners, laws, food, road traffic, housing, standards, language, etc. will differ to some extent from those adopted where you live.
This should always be remembered to avoid disappointment or perhaps even disgust for local ways to do some things.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. Usually, a travel agent is a good option for preparing a trip that goes beyond the previous experience of the traveler regarding nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
While most agencies are willing to accept the most common bookings, many agents specialize in certain types of travel, budget sizes, or directions.
It is better to contact an agent who often books travel similar to yours.
See what travel the intermediary advertises, either on the website or on the showcase.
If you want to see the world without spending a lot of money because of the need, lifestyle or challenge, there are several ways to do so.

Those who are ready to sacrifice comfort, time and planning in order to bring costs closer to zero, pay attention to travel with a minimum budget.
This advice suggests that travelers do not steal, violate, do not participate in cases related to the illegal market, do not begging or otherwise exploiting other people for their own benefit.
Immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop when landing from an aircraft, vessel or other vehicle.
In some international trains, checks occur when the train is already on the road and you must have a valid certificate when you board such trains.
In night trains with sleeping cars, the conductor can collect passports so that you do not have to interrupt sleep.
Registration is an additional requirement for obtaining a visa. In some countries, you must register your presence and address where you have stopped with local authorities.
You may need to fill out a questionnaire in the local police, or visit the migration office.
In many countries where such a law is in force, local hotels will register (do not forget to ask).
In other cases, only those who stop outside the living space for tourists should register. However, this makes the law even more unclear, so find out in advance.
Architecture is associated with the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of the area itself is often a separate tourist attraction.
Many buildings are very beautiful in appearance, and a view of a high building or intelligently located window can be a beauty for contemplation.
Architecture intersects significantly with other industries, including urban planning, civil engineering, decorative art, interior design, and landscape design.
Given how remote many of the Pueblo are, you won’t be able to find a significant nightlife without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and some of them have branded entertainment (mainly in large casinos that are located directly near Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: bars of small cities are not always good places to spend time by visitors from other states.
On the one hand, in northern New Mexico, there is a significant problem with drinking driving, and the concentration of insecure drivers is high near the bars of small cities.
Unwanted murals or indiscriminate inscriptions are known as graffiti.
This phenomenon is far from modern, but people somehow associate it with young people, which negates objects of social and private property with the help of balloons with paint.
However, at this time there are recognized graffiti artists, measures from graffiti and "legal" walls. Graphite paintings in this context often resemble works of art, and not indiscriminately painted nicknames.
Throwing boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists prefer to master.
If you want to learn to throw the boomerang that comes back to you, make sure you have the appropriate boomerang.

Hangi food is prepared in a hot pit in the ground.
The hole is either heated with hot stones from the fire, or in some places geothermal heat makes space on the ground naturally hot.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditional fried dinner.
In several places in Rotorua you will find geothermal hangs, and other hangs can be tried in Christchurch, Wellington, etc.
MetroRail has two classes of electric trains that run within and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (known as third class).
MetroPlus is more convenient and less crowded, but a little more expensive, although tickets for it are still cheaper than regular subway tickets in Europe.
Each train has MetroPlus and Metro cars; MetroPlus cars are always located at the end of the train closer to Cape Town.

At home, due to the constant impact of local microbes, there are very high chances that you have already acquired immunity to them.
But in other parts of the world where bacteriological fauna is new to you, you have a much better chance of facing problems.
In addition, in warm climatic conditions, bacteria grow faster and live longer outside the body.
Hence the torments of the Life of Delhi, the Curse of Pharaoh, Revenge of Montesuma and many of their friends.
Like respiratory system diseases are more common in a cool climate, and intestinal ventricular diseases in hot climates. In most cases, they are significantly irritated, but are not really dangerous.
If you travel to a developing country for the first time — or just a new part of the world — don’t underestimate the potential cultural shock.
Many experienced travelers who travel frequently have been exhausted by the novelty of traveling to developing countries where cultural situations that need to be adapted to can often appear.
Especially in the first days, you should think about spending on Western style and high-quality hotels, food and services that will help you acclimatize.
Do not sleep on the mattress or on the fork on the ground in areas whose local fauna is unknown to you.
If you are going to get out, take a clamshell or a hammock with you to stay as far as possible from snakes, scorpions and the like.
Add to your home comfort delicious coffee in the morning and chamomile tea that relaxes at night.
When you rest at home, you have time to pamper yourself and spend more time cooking something special.
If you feel inflamed to adventure, take the opportunity to drink juice or mix smoothies:
You may discover a simple drink that can be prepared for breakfast when you return to your daily daily daily daily routine.
If you live in a city with a variety of alcohol consumption culture, go to bars or pubs in areas where you don’t be often.
For those who are not familiar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have different semantics.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen such as a virus, bacterium, fungus, or other parasites.
Infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted if you are near an infected person.
Many governments require guests entering or from residents leaving the country of vaccination against a number of diseases.
These requirements often depend on which countries the traveler visited or plans to visit.
One of Charlotte’s advantages, North Carolina, is that it offers many high-quality options for families.
Residents of other areas often mention family kindness as the main reason for moving there, and visitors often notice that the city is easy to enjoy with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of amenities for children in the area of Aptown, Charlotte, has grown exponentially.
Taxis are not usually used by families in Charlotte, although they can be useful under certain circumstances.
There is a surcharge for the transportation of more than 2 passengers, so this option may be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth surrounding the South Pole.
Tourist trips are expensive, require good physical shape, can only take place in the summer from November to February and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
A couple of thousands of staff live here in the summer on four dozen bases mainly in those areas; few remain to winter.
The Inner Antarctica is a deserted plateau that is covered with 2-3 km of ice.
From time to time, special air tours go deep into the country for the sake of mountaineering or to get to the pole, where there is a large base.
The South Pole Travers (or Highway) is a 1600-kilometer route from McCurdo Station along Ross Sea to the pole.
This is a tamped snow, the shells in which were filled and marked with flags. You can ride only on specialized tractors, pulling sleds with fuel and stocks.
They are not too turning, so to get on the plateau, the route makes a long hook around the Transarctic Mountains.
The most common cause of accidents in winter are slippery roads, sidewalks (walking paths) and especially steps.
At a minimum, you need shoes with the appropriate sole. Summer shoes usually slide on ice and snow, even some winter boots are imperfect.
The pattern should be deep enough, not less than 5 mm (1/5 inches), and the material is soft enough at cold temperatures.
Some shoes have spikes and there are additional equipment with spikes for the slippery surface, suitable for most shoes and shoes, for heels or heels and soles.
The sole should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered by roads or paths to increase friction.
Lavines are not an anomaly; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow, and its excess will descend the avalanche.
The problem is that snow is sticky, so it should be given a certain initial impulse so that it goes down, and the east of a certain amount of snow can be a trigger for the rest of the snow mass.
Sometimes it is caused by heating snow under the sun, sometimes the fall of more snow, sometimes other natural phenomena, and often the cause is a person.
Tornado is a pillar of air with very low pressure, which, rotating, sucks the surrounding air inside and up.
They create strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air by moving them while moving tornadoes.
They begin as vortices descending from thunderstorm clouds, and turn into a "tornado" when they reach the ground.
Personal VPN providers (virtual private networks) are a great way to circumvent both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
There are better than web proxy for several reasons: they forward all Internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer higher bandwidth and better quality services. They are encrypted, so it is harder to monitor them.
Information companies usually lie about the goal, arguing that it is "to prevent piracy."
In fact, regional codes do not affect illegal copying; an exact copy of the disk, like the original, will be perfectly played on any device.
The actual goal is to give those companies more control over their markets; the whole thing is in cash.
Since calls are transmitted over the Internet, you do not need to use a phone company located near your place of residence or stay.
There is also no requirement to get a local number from the community where you live; you can get a satellite internet connection in Chiken in Alaska and choose a number that will claim you are in sunny Arizona.
Often you have to buy an international number separately, which allows TMZK phones to call you. Where the number is of great importance for those who call you.
Real-time text translator programs are applications that are able to automatically translate entire fragments of text from one language to another.
Some applications in this category can even translate texts into foreign languages on signs or other objects in the real world when the user directs a smartphone to these objects.
Machine translation has improved significantly, and now often offers more or less correct translations (and less often - packaging), but you need to be vigilant, because everything may be wrong.
One of the most outstanding applications in this category is Google Translate, which makes offline translation possible after downloading the necessary language data.
Using GPS navigation applications on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate the area outside your home country.
Buying a new GPS card, or an autonomous GPS device, can save money, or you can rent it from a car rental company.
If you do not have a data connection for your phone or when it is outside the network area, their performance may be limited or unavailable.
Each store near the house has a confusing number of subscription phone cards that can be used with taxiphones or regular phones.
Most cards are suitable for calls to any direction, but some have favorable tariffs for calls to certain groups of countries.
Access to these services is often provided through a free phone number that can be called from most devices.
Rules for conventional photography also apply to video recording, even more stringent.
If it is forbidden to just photograph something, then do not even think to record it on video.
If you use a copter, check in advance that you are allowed to shoot on film and what permissions or additional license you need to have.
Running a drone near the airport or over the crowd is almost always a bad thought, even if it is legal in your area.
Nowadays, air travel is rarely booked directly through the airline, without prior search and price comparison.
Sometimes on different aggregators prices for the same flights are very different, so it is worth comparing the search results, as well as look at the website of the airline itself before making a reservation.

Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to learn another culture, meet new people, learn something about yourself, feel perspective and even gain new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch the budget to allow longer stay in any place, as many volunteer vacancies provide accommodation and meals, and some pay a small salary.
Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black and Caspian Seas. Some of these paths can still be used. Check if special permits are needed, because they can be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea through Onezke, Ladoga and St. Petersburg Lake, mainly along rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so passing from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.

In short, you will distribute messages with offers of your help, go to the docks, approach people who clean their yachts, try to make contacts with sailors in bars, etc.
Try to communicate with as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know and tell you what kind of boat is now looking for people.

While you can choose the airlines you fly most often, you should know that often privileges and benefits are different, and regular customer points are awarded more generously by other airlines as part of the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airweis, Catar Airweis and Turkish Airlines have already significantly expanded their services to Africa and offer flights to many major cities in Africa at competitive prices, compared to other European airlines.
As of 2014, Turkish airlines operate flights to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time on the road, compare your total cost of traveling to Africa with a travel rate in other countries around the world.
As for all those places outside Africa, do not forget to add the cost of visa costs, departure taxes, land travel, etc.
If you want to fly around the world only in the Southern Hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited due to the lack of transocean routes.
No aviation alliance covers all three ocean intersections in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTim does not cover any intersections).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the southeastern Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a flight LATAM Oneworld.
This flight is not the only option if you want to slip through the South Pacific Ocean and the west coast of South America. (see below)
In 1994, Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan inhabited by ethnic Armenians, waged a war against Azerbaijanis.
The new republic was created with the support of Armenia. However, none of the formed states, even Armenia, recognized it officially.
Diplomatic disputes over this region continue to overshadow relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtencordel) is a famous area of the 17th century that surrounds the inner city of Amsterdam.
The entire area is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, due to its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, meaning Five Lands, consists of five small coastal villages: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Cornilla, Vernazza and Monterosso, located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, people have carefully built terraces on an uneven, rapid landscape to the rocks themselves that go to the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of visible corporate development. Paths, trains and boats combine villages, and by car you can not reach them from the outside.
The varieties of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are somewhat different from the French used in France, although they are similar to a sufficient extent for people to understand each other.
In particular, the numbering system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has certain small features that differ from French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is also somewhat different.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would teach standard French at school to be able to understand you even if you used a standard French numbering system.
In many parts of the world, walking with a hand is a friendly gesture, means "hello".
However, in Malaysia, at least among Malays living in rural areas, this means "going", similar to the body-drawn gesture finger used in some Western countries and should only be used for this purpose.
Similarly, a British tourist in Spain can confuse the farewell gesture of waving the palm addressed to himself (not to the one they wave), with a gesture calling for a return.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or created languages to promote communication between peoples that would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They have nothing to do with lingua franca, which are natural or organic languages that have become dominant for one reason or another as a way of communication between native speakers of different languages.
In hot weather, travelers can see mirages that create the illusion of water (or other things).
They can be dangerous because a traveler who is chasing mirage will waste precious energy and water residues.
Even the hottest desert can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real danger in the absence of warm clothes.
If you decide to walk through the tropical forest, especially in the summer, you need to keep in mind mosquitoes.
Even if you drive through a subtropical forest, a few seconds at open doors while you get in the car, it is enough for mosquitoes to get into the car with you.

Some of the cases were fatal, and only more than a thousand cases have been reported.
Most concerned people who work with domestic birds, but there is some risk for fjordwatchers.
For Norway, typical steep fjords and valleys that are sharply moving into high, more or less levels of polonins.
These polonins are often called "vidde", meaning a wide and open space without forest, an endless width.
In Rugalan and Andera, they are usually called "gei", that is, wood-free marshy area, often covered with heat.
Glaciers do not stand still, but slide from the mountain. This movement causes faults and glacial cracks that can not be seen due to snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and the cracks close.
Huge brooms at the edges of the glaciers break off, fall down or perhaps jump away or roll away from the edge.
The tourist season at mountain stations reaches its peak during grandmother's summer.
However, in winter their beauty and charm appear differently, many mountain stations fall a large amount of snow and offer such types of outdoor activities as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer a ticket for a passenger who has lost a loved one, which slightly reduces the cost of an urgent funeral trip.
