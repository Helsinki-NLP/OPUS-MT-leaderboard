Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of war, will stop beating - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the fighting for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the APU is defeated there, the Russians can leave negotiations and re-occupied territories.
Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights, we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city - ed.) - people who pulled a large number of enemies on themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may not wait to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we will state.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory.”
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but “we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are with us.”
People will accept peace anyway because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine’s independence, but... every family has lost something — and I don’t think they will be satisfied with any peace on any conditions.
But if we don’t speak emotionally, war must end in peace, or end up with millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight, but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing anymore, there's no people."

Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to go to the analysis of the postmodern context as one where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.

We promised that when you went to school, we would surprise you.
It was great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouka the area doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. It happens exactly what I was sad and waited for...
I took children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and did not doubt for a moment that in the event of occupation, the suburbs of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
For I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KDBist regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in prison in Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given a copy of the great-grandfather from the shooting case: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, and the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, and denied guilt.
The ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor "one-two" nobles, never walked in serfs.
The fact that they lived on the hamlets and had several cows was enough to condemn the pahar and feeder of young children to death.
The family did not even know about the burial place.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the knocker Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if his relative was a KGBist informant.
Apple from apple trees near, as you know, falls...
The shooting three, which doomed to the execution of the peasants, were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of the great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources such as the "Besmortal Barak" in Russia, which qualitatively remind you of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, descendants of NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers, the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It seems that files with children's pornography were found on the computer, for it was put in prison, and there he quickly died.
KGBists are now killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why do you suddenly wonder about their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most vile features of human nature.
On top of the thousand-year Ordinian tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
And then, a beast genetic experiment was done by cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the 1992 film Chekist, so it was.
You saw my photos in a swimsuit
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from cough?

According to “European truth”, Welt writes about it with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well as offered howitzers in the version of the Boxer BTR for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to pick up relatively close to enemy targets, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW offer, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be held according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, earlier than the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Are we in the first half of the day or in the afternoon together?

This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...

So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kiev, we honored 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babi Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of the “common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and safe Europe.
We must protect this foundation, it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.”
If “the evil demons of the past appear in new clothes today,” he said, “then for us Germans, there may be only one answer to it: never again!
The fight must continue.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves residents of the cities blocked by it and lets them die from diseases.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles shootings in Babi Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have seen this in real time.
Thus, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which was not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One of you're a song of nitch

Serhiy Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents spoke in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grow.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is making in the war, there is now much criticism at the expense of the Alliance and member-country members - for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the reluctance to “irritate” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In a new episode of the podcast “Cloth Question” together with the editor of European Truth, we are talking about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed at negotiations with Russia can become the second memorandum.
What do you think here

I refused him.
Then after a while, he called that he had heart surgery.
I asked him to talk to him, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
We talked a lot during this time.
I started problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe I really need to look at him differently.

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say “previously did not do this”
Direct language Konashenkov: "We see attempts at sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously been held.
The Russians have launched missile strikes on Kiev since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the occupation forces of the Russian Federation into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that shot down the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valeriy Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower on Dorogozhichi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the downed missile of the invaders crushed the house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, from which one person died, 19 more people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that residents of the capital who evacuated from the city are still too early to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unbroken ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians plan to win a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil base exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgoroda said that a “Ukrainian shell” allegedly fell near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in Washington and Berlin throw into cold sweat from the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that has not been available to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples that choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated alloy of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While Biden is strongly opposed to closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against accelerating Ukraine’s accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don’t want to be considered scammers.

These are heroic leaders who go to the combat zone without fear, calm and help refugees in cars, and at peace stations help volunteers to ship humanitarian cars.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr route in the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities who carry out garbage under fire, repair water pipelines and power lines to provide people with the necessary.

The Foreign constituency of Ukraine (ZVO of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine, and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad,[output 1] on which Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located.[1] The role of the district election commission for the Foreign Election Commission is performed by the Central Election Commission.
In the Foreign constituency, only national voting is held: presidential elections and MPs and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections in the ZVO are not held.

I went to school today too.
I saw Christina's mother today, but she didn't even say hello.
Very delicious apples, what kind is this?
The head of the President’s Office Andriy Yermak said that Russia is launching a “fake operation” on weapons, which the allies transfer to us.
Yermak: “They understand that they lose war, see their backwardness, and seek to ‘break off’ the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the destruction of S-300 air defense systems transmitted by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers surrender with weapons from the allies, and it is massively moving into service with the Russian army.
I want to warn these fakes right away.
Because weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively send the enemy to that world.
Sorry, I forgot to ask how much a bed will cost a month and will it work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as a “provocation.”
“Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth the condemnation,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must respond to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that its government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents a "violation of international law".
The statements came after reports appeared that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after occupation within weeks.
Photos that allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with tied hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and the criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops committed “war crimes” in Bucha.
“What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit a "genocide" in Bucha.
“We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not remain unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova rejected the charges as a "provocation".
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, I think the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubt about who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also said without evidence that Bucha’s image was “another setting of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
The Russian Investigative Committee on April 4 released a statement announcing a “investigation” on charges of spreading “knowingly false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing a “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being implemented,” Zelensky said in a video address, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head,” he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with our hands and beheaded, I don’t understand,” he said of the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian service Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city bodies like civilians.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people — all in civilian — were scattered on the ground near a place that locals say used Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from close distance.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which was controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, we bought everything on the list.
"They said: Kiev is not." How the invaders took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
In this list there is another item, which currently has much less information - the export of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Since about mid-March, Russian invaders have “evacuated” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave under the Russian military training ground.
Ukrainian Pravda found the exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same “evacuation” is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text came to voluntarily-force evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took children without parents from there, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine for swimming Joseph Zachatsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at Antonov airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but in the morning of February 24 they did not have time to evacuate.
They didn’t have a car, and they didn’t take anyone.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, following which the first shells flew.
One of them hit the nearby house.
The family then went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people hid in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
“At 6 pm on February 24, people who spoke not Russian and not in Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They ask, "Is it who?" - I say, yes. - "Get out!".
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were weapons.
All the men were questioned if they served in the army.
The women were told, "We came to protect you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even troops, young boys of 25-35 years old.
They said: “We were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sasha White (commanded the squad of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO “Viking”, which fought on the side of Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - the UP), now we came to help you.”
On the third day, they asked what we lacked.
We say the water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all just Russian pick up" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are still videos on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after looting the store and say, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child says, “You have 7 days to give our phones,” they laughed.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and good in general: “Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can do nothing, because there is our families.”
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
The bullet was brought to himself, one was tied to one leg Georgian ribbon, and to the other - his white scotch and called it "polchenko".
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so they didn't even take the dead, they asked us, "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had erected troops - the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked passwords to identify their own or someone else.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian OMON came, and after them - Omsky landing.
They supplied 30-40 units of equipment between the houses - ours constantly got into it from the Bayractars.
But these came and told us that the APU was no longer there, but there is Azov, and, according to them, Azov is so 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative “Kyiv has already surrendered” has advanced since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us — either a landing officer or a FSB representative — and says there will be evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - there was about Bucha, Gostomel, thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we handed our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: “You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov.”
We say we don't want there or there.
To which they said, "So regret your children's psyche!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - or "Grads" or mortars.
And then it came back... the neighboring houses just burned, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit in our house in the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it is for traitors of the homeland - they say, "we are shot there, they will sell to the authorities."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road were burning, broken up equipment, although Belarusians told that the Russian equipment was immediately exported to them.
There are a lot of caponirs, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear shots! Shoots the missile, and you can see the trace - it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "But no, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
We were then loaded into the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovich, came, says: “I am a hoach, I am from Chernihiv.
But I remember that Putin with Lukashenka will not be established, until these your ears will not be completed.
The crazy people are terrying!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
He's gonna say it, so it's going to be."
They offered interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us, "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN missions (at least they were called so) spread misinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with documents - my daughter did not have a passport.
We had to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
In the Ukrainian consulate, we were not helped, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports, no one would take anyone on the bus.
I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were placed in Minsk and escorts were carried out.
The sanatorium was not held by force.
Our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Traveling near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the missile first flies out, glows beautifully, and then extinguishes.
People who took a bus in Mozir said that the Russians there were constantly shooting from the ranges.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us she would break something to her son if he was called.
The northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, is not believed at all.
They say, “You are lying, we are a peaceful people.”
They do not accept that their landfills are used for shelling of Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us who took us to Estonia.
We are now registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, for sure, as much as Estonian.
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to - there is no house anymore.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.

On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk reported a joyful message - the Ukrainian military on March 31 liberated the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this point was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied hands and shot in the back of the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
Killed and with traces of torture found the elder village of Motyzhyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
Olga and Alexander’s bodies were in the mass grave, Igor was in the sewer.
On the side of the route 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
If I go home, no one will be at home.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, which was published by the Presidential Office, writes “European truth”.
“All the equipment they already send, for some types of equipment it is too late.
So what if we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, that’s true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,” Zelensky said.
Asked if Ukraine got enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: “No yet, not yet.”
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not have been, or it would have a different appearance.
“It would unfold differently, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war,” he added.
The British Prime Minister promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I dream that the war is over and go home.

“We have been hiding an infu from my mother-in-law for a whole month about the war.
So far, it succeeds.
However, in Bottles (cat - UP) on the umbilical cord and hind legs, fur has climbed - this can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The bottle, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."

And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
“I lived with her in an apartment for 33 days.
The war was hidden from it, and the fact that I was near was formally coming as always for several hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her a receiver, she listened to her for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio was always at the bed.
Most of his mother-in-law spends most of his time in his room.
He feels bad, it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I hid in my room.
I hid the receiver and TV from her.
Then I called everyone who communicates with her. It's 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk about anything, but not about war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
April 17 - I have 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I never thought about it :)

The British, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, says that he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a soldier of the Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: Aidin Eislin's twitter page, a British who has served in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2018, the BBC with reference to Aislin's family members and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of the friend Aislin, who spoke with him
Aslin, “We received the message from him: “It was 48 days, we tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice except to surrender Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th separate brigade of the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense operation of Mariupol.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of the soldier En Wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son reported that they were planning to surrender.
Military friend Brennan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in a last telephone conversation, Icelin had told of their surrender unit plans.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units, so as not to get without weapons and bullets into the hands of the so-called "kadyrovists".
Also in social networks distributed audio recording of a telephone conversation, on which allegedly Eislin speaks to his friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Eislin said they were trying to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in battles against terrorists of the so-called “Islamic State” in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin's friends and friends called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossacks Gundi.

When you can bring things
Very interesting tradition, we go like this for Christmas.
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a bill 7176, which is called “On monitoring potential threats to Ukraine’s national security in the field of economy”.
It is surprising that in fact the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the field of economy was... the place for whom members of the supervisory board of state companies and state banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that had a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location address.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - it is a great basis for "disposing" all the gains in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establish manual management.
The one that happened before 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill “flys” under patriotic slogans, then others can take off tomorrow - for example, you can demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the war and bill 7176.
On February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of the bill 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another circulates among some people’s deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation in the risks of loss of the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for the remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company’s work can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent him from moving members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal security higher than the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
So the decision proposed by bill 7176 is likely not able to protect the ability to make decisions by the supervisory board from losing, but rather the opposite will lead to this!
MP, author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in his support.
In particular, he notes: “many enterprises, in particular the defense industry complex (OPK), now need to be relocation” and therefore “it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information.”
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state enterprises of the defense industry, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the CEO, who by the way will decide on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand criticism also because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state enterprises of the defense industry at all.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also cites arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and state banks, but let’s try to understand some of them: “respective foreign experts at the first word “war”, leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from the war.”
First, it is manipulation - most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they “leave Ukraine”, to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool is long common in world practice, and in completely different fields: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time work.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims against the members of the supervisory boards that are Ukrainians?
They are not at the location of their companies either.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from the supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. With me 2 children.

We usually need a passport from one of the adults.
In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts of the Kiev region, which were liberated from the invaders, will be invited by an increased curfew for 2 days.
Direct language Pavlyuk: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts, which were under Russian occupation and were released by Ukrainian defense forces, curfew has been strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will be valid from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the region, at this time it is strictly forbidden to stay on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm signal to go into shelter.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clean up and exchange the territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas so far to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget has grown exponentially for several years.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, updating military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalizing.

The security forces of the Lukashenka regime detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichs, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Swaboda", human rights center "Vyasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained with the security support of special forces “SOBR”, one was injured.
According to "Explain", when detained, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will stop" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch "BZD" and the administrator of thematic resources "BZD" in VKontakte and "Classmates" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reports ?belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared by the regime of Lukashenko extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport facilities and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian “rail partisans” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation transfers to fight, in Ukraine there is a living force and equipment.

The United States prohibits investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin’s daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as prohibit all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets that relate to the US financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will impose a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision adopted by more than 600 multinational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector’s exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of new US sanctions was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin’s adult children, wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including ex-President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
Journalist of the TV channel “1+1” Natalia Nagorna published on the morning of April 12 a video handed over to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
The military says they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said, "The calculation goes for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate brigade of the Marine Corps, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the connection of the command with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of Azov Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by the fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. It would be very good
The situation is the same as long as we stay here.
2 hours of ride )) walk, mom in shops and back)!
It's not an important matter
She forgot what she would do here.
The squadron of Czech drones from today began flights over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional copters will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers “birds” to Ukraine were sent the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their intermountain friends led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur delivered drones as intended: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to usecopters as efficiently and safely as possible - the places of their deployment will now be left secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say: in the coming days, many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I was not worried, everything is fine. I love sweet, but I can without it
I'm worried we won't have time. A lot of luggage.
I am going back to Ukraine soon and working.
Okay. If it's okay, I agree
I'll try myself, but if I'll write to you, if I can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the lady of old age in the village in Jivov,she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no home
Maybe she will be happy and will get up.
I was repaired my phone today.
I think I’m still on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I am also sorry, but it is better to meet when I am healthy.
When you have time, save me music that you like.
I am interested in what musical overcoming you have ?
Mom and Dad should listen.
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler and raining. Tomorrow it should be warm.
But it is not a pity for the destroyed houses, the harm of people who are being abused by the occupiers
In Kherson, the invaders abused the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore the flag of the European Union, crushed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers broke portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They demolished the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the kids for the carol, we have no such custom so we knew, gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to give
There is someone to talk about in Czech if anything.
Because I live like in a dormitory Up to twelve people here, and then go to work
Hello is a little better.
I was in the gums today.
I was sleeping there even today.
We have great progress.
I'll definitely bring dumplings to others together!
I have no power to do them.
Since I push back from days and time in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can say about April a month because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For May, I can say about April or early May.
I just asked if you were talking about it.
Hello, I'm sorry I didn't write off for a long time and slept a little
If you don't mind yet, could I come today?)
or meet after your arrival)
He is modest, recently he has learned a lot. I realized that it is very necessary for him in life
Hi, it went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today, I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the department of economics of the region highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
The money in the gums showed himself well.
On Monday I have to bring confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for gums.
I've been lazy from Friday.
I don’t do anything to them just a lot and sleep ? (and drink a lot of water ?)
If I went to the doctor tomorrow and went with you if I could
I have to bring another analysis.
You don’t have to go again.
Very bad work drain tank, does not wash well. Need a master. We need to set up.
That's how everything is enough
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have enrolled in.
And children are fed there or should they bring with them?
And now you can go to you for a moment there is one question.
If you still need help write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't want you to raise funds from the beginning, so that people don't think we're speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have enough two points:
I will go to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good morning
I'll watch the video now. It'll be good because the whole family will paint.
Karazin University encourages employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army
I have collected a few works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet should be held.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How I'll be credited with the day that I wasn't at work is a pass
Staff construction: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army could resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine “in aggression against a neighboring state.”
Literally: "It is not excluded to conduct provocative actions by the armed forces of the Russian Federation in the territory of the Pridnestrovian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansk direction.
In the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is being carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastirishche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of personnel of the battalion tactical group units from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Zabaikal region), the 29th general military army of the Eastern Military District is recruited military personnel from the composition of the specified brigade.
The enemy feels a special problem when completing the positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to combat sites, will continue to strike the objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy them or disable them.
The designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In Slobozhansky direction, individual units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and Coastal Forces of the Northern Fleet continue partial blocking of the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, air reconnaissance of the area is ongoing in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this purpose, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
By force to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, and did not succeed and withdrew to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhny and Novobahmutivka, as well as the establishment of complete control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the Golden area, he had no success.
In Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of individual units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of settlements of Vysopillya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
In the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine for the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automotive equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Did you understand your thoughts?
We will try to get it, but I doubt
And you can sleep and I'll keep you
You definitely don't mind coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see today, then tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thank you. We have not watched TV at home and even more than 1+1. We do not need to configure :)
I will turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language
I have the tariff package for a month today :)
Can we do it on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I know I can prepare material in this area.
I ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
My father and I'll meet then, I'll definitely meet .
I read the ads on Facebook , maybe Google something on his writing. , I think the phone numbers are enough
Good afternoon, we're the things you brought, but are there things that little things you can bring them on us in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director is satisfied, then I can start going to work next week because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if it comes, because very large queues) and on Saturday rain :)
Looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry in school, studying Czech to know perfectly, dream of working in Tev
Friends are old and not very, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you have hard times too.
I have been talking to many of you over the past month.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilty and ashamed because of your country’s actions towards your neighbors.
Because of why they are being subjected to Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been in danger, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very ancient friend from the Memorial.
I will tell you a little later, as usual, Sasha answered succinctly. - Now after the search, we walk through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be frank: with the exception of very few of you — those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, the Echo of Moscow, in Meduz, Navalny’s organization and in a number of other places — have many of you done at least something to resist this regime?
Except for participating in the rallies when they still happened.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's nice to hide, it's too late to remain silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around, your apathy, and your passive complicity, which are now probably a great burden on your soul and heart?
That wasn't always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you owned freedom and democracy to some extent - disorderly even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why every time you finally have a revolution, you are eventually overwhelmed by such a strong fear of confusion that you are looking for salvation behind the king’s back, let his name Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer near him. Why is it?
There were indeed mistakes.
Instead of capturing and publishing KGB archives, as the Germans did with a strain, you took your soul on the monument to Dzerzhinsky — and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, renew, re-form and seize power over the country.
When you were given a choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option - and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to align Chechnya with the ground again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I worked in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar Jurta, Itum Kala and other cities.
Sometimes this weekend I went back to Moscow and hung up with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, about the children killed, about soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Bred, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I resented, "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government who is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers that some of the stolen money would remain in the middle class pockets.
Many of you have become good at earning, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased a new home and found a better job.
Prices are rising, but is it trouble?
Moscow festively shone and bald from chic.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuri Shchekochichin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
But it didn’t go further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev, and he himself took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after months of Medvedev’s rule, most of you ignored it or conspired.
How many of you have met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we hardly did a lot in the West, if we did anything at all.
A little outrage, a little sanctions; but what matter was that Russia is blatantly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
After the hard 1990s, it was the most important.
At the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, woke up.
When Putin again switched places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massively protested.
Navalny's name became nickname, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing the soil under your feet.
He then struck back.
Alternative actions were first organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have had huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I have heard it so often and I still hear it.
“The state is so strong and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Dispersed by the pro-Russian president, who cheated on their European expectations, they once captured Maidan — and never left it again.
They built the tent town on their own and prepared for decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Police eventually opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose leaders on their own and expel them if they do their job badly.
The Maidan did not like Putin.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
Some of you have been against it, but there is little benefit from this.
How many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From somewhere, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his puck suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it hard to find a reason because we stopped communicating immediately after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We are not interested in politics,” you said.
And you've been hiding new in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, like new ones after the restoration, which the mayor of Moscow began in 2012, with their binbegs, a publicly available wifay and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it becomes only better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or what... Even the Moscow editor who released my book about Syria criticized it then in an interview, because I didn’t understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw state snipers cold-bloodedly shoot my children's peers on the streets of Homs.
Only your soldiers visited all Russian citizens, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Nimeler:
“First they came for the socialists, but I was silent because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for trade union members, but I was silent because I was not a member of the trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I was silent because I was not Jewish.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the vast majority were silent.
Some really say now - like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new Gulag or to make a Navalny company.
As for others, you know best in which country you live in.
So I’m sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians — or, which seems very likely, if he doesn’t succeed, he will take you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are courageous, but mostly alone went to protests and still took place a minor term, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions who expressed disagreement on social networks (even even with a black square on Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just an anecdote, remained in such a distant past — and now they are likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians, even more than in 2014, scares Putin’s regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation and courage can stop it, no matter how depressing it may be on paper its advantage.
Given everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know what's going on now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you maintain communication.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what everything is going to.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your choices are just a hoax, your laws, if you don’t take into account the repressive, are worth nothing more than the paper they’re written on, your latest free media is no longer there, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if any flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will require your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try either somehow go or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see another option.
And yet there is another one left.
Which will eventually break this regime.
And maybe in the conditions that have developed, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flare up from you: due to the economic collapse coming to Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the province, in small cities.
When prices take off and wages will not be paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but other, more informal, more decentralized, can be created.
There are many of you, you are millions.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps a hundred thousand.
If there are over 300,000, it will be stunned.
You will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them to in Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel clear fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, it's normal.
I would be afraid in your place too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what is happening to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat — and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the internet — and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake — and die in a raw cell under police oaks.
That’s what’s been happening for many years, and then it will only intensify, gaining more and larger proportions.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it's gonna end.
Act cold-bloodedly, think strategically and achieve this becoming a reality.
We were at the class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday.
We will be at home in the evening
What you see me as a press secretary

I went to the playroom in Natalie today, say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our children's room yesterday until 19:00.

And eventually it is our responsibility.
