Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will be “associated with the Mappets”
Some CHAs are horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their position to the "member of Parliament of Wales" (MWP).
This recommendation came due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Wales Parliament.
The entire political spectrum is concerned that this could provoke ridicule.
One Labour Cup stated that his group is concerned about rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "unsmart" and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
The Czech Party of Wales said his group as a whole was "not satisfied" and offered alternatives.
One Welsh conservatives said his group was "unpredicted" about the name change, but noted that MWP could quickly become a "mappet".
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing legislation to change names, noted: "The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be made by the members themselves."
The Wales Self-Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public discussion of proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales received wide support.
As for what to call the CA, the commission proposes to call them "members of the Welsh Parliament", i.e. WMP, but the MWP option has received the most public support.
Of course, the CHA offers alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement can cause problems to presiding Elina Jones, who must submit a bill to change within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the suspension of the NA and the structure of the committee system.
The NA will hold a final vote on its new name when the legislation will be discussed.
Macedonians vote for referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote was organized to resolve a long-term dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim to Greece, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov, who opposes a referendum on name change, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price that needs to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin are silent, because Harlem churches are going through difficult times
“The old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church here at every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither one nor the other."
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“People are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer a local living room where they regularly come in."
As for churches, Adams fears that money from selling assets will not be enough for as long as leaders hope, and “early or later they will find themselves where they started.”
Churches, he added, can replace houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the remaining shrines.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these homes will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870 and Saint Martin ten years after it.
The indigenous white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community that conducted rituals nearby was granted ownership of the building.
Saint Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125 Street, Harlem's main shopping street. These merchants did not want to hire blacks and raise them.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but the parishioners of Father Johnson wanted to restore it and installed a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in Saint Martin, proudly called the carillon "calls of the poor".
An expert who played a carillon in July called it a different way: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionycio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, he was not replaced in Saint Martin.
What has been happening in Saint Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors. Some of them have been involved in church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The Council, the parish’s governing body, which consists of peace leaders — wrote to the diocese in July that she was concerned that the diocese would "try to transfer costs" to the council that the council did not participate in the mercery architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-old boy who dives behind lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy dived behind lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack occurred at almost 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy was crying for help, and along with the group sailed to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a delight about the caught lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his collarbone was completely torn.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, ‘A shark’ in the water,” Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in the area, but it was found that it did not belong to dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the trunk.
In order to investigate and security, authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using islands with cosmetics similar to those in department stores. Work on islands will be qualified sellers.
As part of the increased entry into the British cosmetics market worth ?2.8 billion (continues to grow at a time when sales of clothing and household goods are declining) increased islets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country. Next year, if the idea turns out to be successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics are due to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space that was previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double their range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will get more space: there will be branded zones similar to those that are in stores like Boots.
Supermarket also updates Boutique’s range of cosmetics: now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly required by young buyers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is testing its trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, northern London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and moving to buying small amounts of food every day in small stores force supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Kupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said their stores would become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist Aldi and Lidl discounters through more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opens Argos departments in hundreds of its stores, also opened a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claim that this increased food sales, and also made both networks more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to update the departments of cosmetics and pharmaceutical products ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after arguing about how to share pharmacy revenues in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy business (281 pharmacy) Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for ?125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help add an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance of our cosmetics islands to make the atmosphere more enjoyable for buyers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands we present is designed to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient locations mean that now we are an attractive place for buying cosmetics, which is a competition for the old way of buying. ”
Peter Jones is "declared" because Holly Willoughby withdrew from the deal worth ?11 million
Dragon's Ice Star Peter Jones is "declared" because TV presenter Holly Willouby has dropped out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the deal cost is ?11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willouby has no time for the brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
The couple's business was associated with the Goop brand Gwyneth Peltrow.
The 37-year-old host of the program This Morning announced her entry on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones's Dragon's Lion star to rabies when at the last moment she left their profitable life goods business to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "shaked" when a gold girl from TV confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals worth ?1.5 million mean she no longer has enough time to devote it to their shared brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
This business was linked to the Goop brand Gwyneth Peltrow and was to double Willoughby's fortune, which is estimated at ?11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby reported on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of her holiday homes.
The source reported, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
He was to be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to get out of business stunned all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
Marlow headquarters has a full composition of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entry of the host This Morning, which is one of the highest paid stars in the UK, could cost the firm millions through large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes) and create further delays with the launch.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the board in March.
Couples spent holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's company, which is engaged in television production.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his affairs."
A tough conversation, “and then we fell in love.”
He joked about criticism he would receive from the news media for comment that someone would consider "non-presidential", as well as for a very positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make such big concessions?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news host.
I didn't make any concessions."
He noted that Kim is interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have come to a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a “appropriate response” from the United States to its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues sanctions aimed at supporting pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have such a beautiful relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American servicemen home.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about a relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave in the presidential way, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this beat, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake on Lomboka, foreign NGOs were told that their help is not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboka’s population was affected, the national disaster was not declared, and this is a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it’s somewhat difficult,” said Ms Sumbung.
Although Save the Children gathers a team for a trip to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given that earthquakes are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh province, tsunami storages are built, but they are not characteristic of other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was active likely contributed to death.
Moving between the many Indonesian islands is not just even in the best times.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A medical ship in Lomboca to treat earthquake victims sail to Palu, but will be able to reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's improved infrastructure as the basis of his election campaign and increased spending on roads and railways.
But the funding deficit has created problems for the administration of Mr. Joko, who plans to re-elected next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by prolonged interfaith hostility in those parts of Indonesia where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died, tens of thousands were evicted from their homes as a result of confronting Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machete, meadows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Starridge of Liverpool scores a goal from the depth of the field and equalizes the score with Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League with his goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stafford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri when he was about 27 meters from Chelsea Gate. At this point, his team lost 1-0.
He threw the ball on his left leg and charged it towards a long bar.
The ball flew high above the penalty towards the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the jumping Capa Arrisabalaga and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time. Players like Shakiri always go on attack as possible, so I just tried to secure myself as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, and made one touch, I didn't think about it too much and just took the ball.
Chelsea were 1-0 after the first half, in which Belgian star Eden Azar scored the goal in the 25th minute.
The blue attacker passed the pass back Mateo Kovacic, twisted near the middle of the field and quickly ran half of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly played in the wall in the middle of the field.
He then made a fine penetrating pass that brought Azar to a penalty.
Azar overtook the defense and made a decisive blow with his left foot in the grid of the long rod. The ball passed by Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at S. Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Indonesian disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the wreckage of buildings destroyed during a 7.5-point Friday earthquake that caused waves 6 meters high, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which lives over 380,000 people, was filled with debris of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death

I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who could have taken something to the video register, contact us, as the information on these videos can be very important for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today, in the afternoon, friends who believe they know a woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they were currently informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Muses had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter the house and leave it.

Cromwell statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that will suffer from "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be a deserved retribution for the destruction in the Taliban style of many cultural and religious artifacts of England, which was made by its fanatical followers-puritans.
But Cromwell's community called Mr. Creek's proposal "foolty" and "an effort to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said, "Given the current debate about the removal of statues, that a statue of Oliver Cromwell near Westminster Palace would be a target was inevitable."
Iconoclastism during the English civil wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his orders.
Cromwell will probably be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The majestic statue of Cromwell sculptor William Hamo Tornecroft is evidence of the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the figure, which many believe are still worth honoring.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many are probably more in the late 19th century than they do now, Cromwell considers the defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether such an idea is quite accurate is the subject of historical debate that continues.
There is no doubt only that the conflict of the mid-17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell was one of the famous figures that represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and honoring."
Murderer pig removes Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in the market in southwestern China.
A man identified only by Yuan's name was found dead in blood with a torn artery near a pig in a market in Lipanshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Sinin, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, the pig is going to vaccinate pigs in a pig garden.
He reportedly left with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw that the pigkeeper's door was open.
The brother noted that there was a large boar with blood on the mouth in the pig.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 249-pound boar removed the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were in blood and distorted," said the victim's cousin with the surname Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A safety camera recording showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that when police were gathering evidence at the scene, the pig was locked to prevent her attack on people.
It is reported that seven of me Yuan and the market administration discuss compensation for his death.
Although rare, but cases of pig attacks on people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and inflicted a man critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig had kept a Welsh farmer pressed against the tractor until the farmer's wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood could become a "trigger".
“They are just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect," he said.
Hurricane Rose's remains will bring extensive rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was projected to weaken, moving over the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rose will bring rains with floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The rose had winds of 137 km per hour (this is a Category 1) hurricane as of 5 a.m. east time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a basin begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rose approaches the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Further in the coming days, tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching basin will create strong rains in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous rains, garbage flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Severe tropical humidity will lead to an increase in rainfall in places to 5 to 7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in a significant area of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise you not to go to the desert on foot, because tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring gusty winds and dust storms here.
The approach of the basin will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause weak garbage flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, and on Monday and Tuesday evening rain will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will go over the For-Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature changes throughout the United States, as it becomes colder in the Arctic, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature changes at short distances.
On Sunday, you can see a great example of sharp temperature changes in the central United States.
This is nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moins, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer heat will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that in a significant area of the center and east of the United States will be warm by October, and temperatures from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in Brett Kavanaugh case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the exciting testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Political confrontation continued, channels interrupted planned programs to report the latest Friday news: a deal prepared by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation into the prosecution by the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent confident that Cavano mated her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanano said in his emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
It is likely that on Friday it was observed by more than 20.4 million people, as reported by research company Nielsen.
The company counted average audiences of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
It was not possible to immediately get numbers on other networks that also showed hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison, such an audience in size is similar to the audience watching a playoff match or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion show hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the leader among all channels during a hearing that lasted all day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, with 2.89 million in MSNBC, with 2.52 million in CNN.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central figure of Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh. After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters shouted at Flake when he tried to go on the elevator to a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes lowered for a few minutes, during which he was barked, broadcast live on CNN.
“I stand right in front of you,” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have power, and many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had published a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the committee's hearing.
All cable and wide-language channels conducted live broadcast hours later when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh's candidacy for a vote to the Senate in full.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which is required by a democratic minority.
Flake was partly convinced of the conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Kuns and then with several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had an impact because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to appoint Kavanaugh's candidacy without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of 'games of politics' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in “games in politics” with the future of the UK and undermine national interests.
On 29 September 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview, which was released alongside an interview with Teresa on the top page of the newspaper, former foreign minister of her government Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Chekers plan on Brexit, saying that offering Britain and the EU to charge each other's duties "absolutely absurd".
Who shot Wade Sims: Police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of death of Louisiana State University player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities published a video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost glasses during the fight.
According to CBS affiliated TV channel WAFB, police removed glasses from the crime scene and noted that they had found Simpson's DNA on them.
After asking Simpson, police reported that he had admitted to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was assigned a deposit of $350,000.
The office of the crowner East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department expresses its gratitude to the special unit to search for Louisiana State Police fugitives, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University Police, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
Louisiana State University Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for the "oldness and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Wil Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what worries you at all times," Wade said.
Volcano throws ash to Mexico City
Ashes, which ejects the volcano Popocatepetl, reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as activity began in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were reported in 24 hours.
The center tracked numerous noises and shocks.
The photo in social networks shows thin layers of ash on the windshield of cars in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Khachimykko.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity of the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, following a 7.1-point earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters in favor of independence clashed with a special police unit. Thousands of people joined protesters' demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on the separation.
A proseparatist masked group held back by special forces threw them eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
The clashes occurred later on this day, police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, groups of independence supporters who chanted "Let's not forget, let's not forgive!" faced supporters of preserving the country who shouted: "Let Spain live!".
According to the local press, fourteen people were assisted for mild injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which is declared illegal by Madrid but noted by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region seeking independence remain high.
Voters mostly decided to vote for independence, but the turnout was low, because most of those against the branch boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups held Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but had to go on a different route.
Narsis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy that they can vote, but now we have gone to a dead end,” he said.
Despite the vital but very complex victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties in favor of independence failed to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment in anticipation of trial for their participation in organizing a referendum and further declaring independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the detention center since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“The candidate’s status in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car drove into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car drove into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard-Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings observed that the gate and the house itself had been damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was shot from the crossbow.
Menga's blow secured Livingston victory over Rangers with a score of 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston became the winner
Raised in the Livingston class stunned Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard a second defeat of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's blow proved decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to the same level with Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard's team has not won any wins on the Premier League this season and next Sunday will play Harts leaders, from whom it lags behind eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its invincible move to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has not yet been defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chances that non-settling guests give.
Holt's team was to be ahead long before they scored, because their directness creates Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, then Alan Litgou broke through the gate after opposing and took Craig Halkett's blow along the gate he made head.
The owners were satisfied that they allowed Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
So the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers missed a free blow, and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson involved Meng, who took the ball and scored from the center of the penalty.
Prior to this stage, Rangers dominated the ball's possession, but the protection of the field hosts turned out to be impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly not worried.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did manage to strike towards Kelly.
Scott Pittman's blow knocked off the goals of the Rangers Allan McGregor. Litgou hit the gate in another standard combination of Livingston.
The canopies were constantly flying into Livingston penalty and constantly neutralized, and two penalty applications — after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton, who came out to replace, and at the game with his hand — were rejected.
The phenomenon of Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal game and Livingston result.
All played perfectly to one, they continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have not changed much after returning to the highest level, but Holt should be paid tribute to how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grandly, organized the defense very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly on guard.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerrard's leadership, but now they do not reach those standards much.
They lacked the last ball — only once they broke through the defense of the field hosts — and it was something like waking up for Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was ambiguously accepted in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and blue sky were visible.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There were some disputes between them on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police did not give 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still appeared nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — among them many Kurds — have also forced themselves to hear. They condemn Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests indicate the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks called a hero and others a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: a cyclist died in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Deptford area of the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. British standard time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died after the driver escaped from the scene of the adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
London police said they were working to identify the man's identity to inform his closest relatives.
Travel is prohibited and bus routes have been changed, motorists are recommended to avoid this zone.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners injured in riots
Six prison workers were injured in riots in a men's strict regime prison, the prison administration said.
The riots at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire began at around 09:30 British standard time on Sunday and still continues.
To stop the riots initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special Tornado unit was called.
Officers were given medical care due to mild facial injuries sustained at the scene.
A prison service spokesman commented: "To resolve the incident ongoing in Her Majesty's Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six employees received medical care due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and their stay behind bars can be extended."
Her Majesty's Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had been sent for inpatient treatment after the prisoner's attack.
Last October, police special forces were called to prison to stop serious riots, during which jailers were attacked with billiard layers.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with rain floods (souling areas it may be in favor of)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but this can happen early next week, as the remains of Hurricane Rose are heading through the southwest of the desert, creating a risk of rain floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of rain floods on Monday and Tuesday in areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday evening it will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones retained tropical storm status or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950,
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, in the Mogollon-Rome area in Arizona, from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and in places up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of precipitation, in places possible up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of rain floods, Rose's rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these showers are likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest drought category, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rose's path leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
The rose, on Sunday morning in the force of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm occurs with cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that with the force of a tropical storm during the day or evening of Monday, the hurricane will cause a landslide in Mexico.
The rainfall in some parts of Mexico may be significant, which poses a significant risk of floods.
“The total rainfall from Lower California to northwestern Sonora is expected to be 7.62 to 15.24 cm, up to 25.4 cm,” weather.com reports.
Rose will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue to go through Arizona and late Tuesday evening will reach southern Utah.
“The main danger expected from Rose or its remains is very heavy rains in Gentle California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwest of the American desert,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening rains and garbage flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer-Norton attack: four people arrested who attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
An injured teenager was found in the Exelsior Terras area in Midsomer-Norton at around 04:00 British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area, police reported Avon and Somerset.
Police are asking everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says Kavanano ‘tolered the Democratic Party’s anger and anger
“Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "tolered the Democratic Party's meanness and anger" throughout the nomination process.
Kavanano testified before Congress on Thursday, unselfishly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that he committed sexual violence against her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing about the charges she made.
On Saturday, the president said that day "the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most complete lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service experience," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republican turnout in the medium-term elections.
“In five weeks, there will be some of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t run, but I’m really running,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “oppose and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavano's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is rising
At least 384 people died, many washed away into the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people rested at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 ft) in dusk broke off the shore, knocking many down to death and destroying everything in their way.
Tsunami occurred after a 7.5-point earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their affairs on the beach and did not immediately start fleeing, and they were victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"It wasn't just a tsunami, it moved cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land," Nugroho said, adding that, before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges are turned out and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The tremors in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times larger than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the force of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage "wide-scale" and noted that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the wreckage of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that casualties and damage could be larger than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The communications lines were completely damaged and we didn't get any information" from Donggala," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and it is added that his staff and volunteers have left for the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the report said.
On Saturday, the agency received wide criticism for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
The amateur footage people shared on social media shows a man on the upper floor of the house shouts crazy warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall crashed into the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power outage that cut off the link around Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue actions.
The military began sending cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still need food and other essentials.
The city airport was opened only for help, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaulin tents installed in the yard of their office, but along the way they saw devastation scenes, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he shared.
That's very bad.
Even when aid groups began decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarian aid workers were not allowed to go to Palu with extensive experience.
Under Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "Okay, it's a national disaster," we will be able to accept international assistance, but that status has not yet been granted."
The second night fell to Pala after Friday earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families of those who have not yet been found still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would decorate these gloomy natural disasters stories.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers got a woman who lay under stones for two days along with her mother’s body next to her mother.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliderism team, trained two missing paragliderists to participate in the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliderists who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior in paragliderism, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread among the paragliderist community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to Palu rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray tick rather than double blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while replenishing ATM in Newport on the Leavee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refueling an ATM from Newport on the Levee, according to Newport Police Department news.
The driver of the car emptyed the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, the other man "run behind to a Brink employee" and stole a bag of money designed to replenish.
Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the crime scene, but police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about these individuals should contact the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote, "Previously officially known as Kanye West."
West's 41-year-old was called Ye for a while, and he used this abbreviation as a title for his album released in June.
The change took place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandi.
On the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", the show's author said.
It is not only a reduction in the current professional name, earlier West said that this word has religious meaning for him.
“I believe that ‘is’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, it's us.
Kanye, meaning "single," was shortened to simply Is — it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deaddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brothers Love.
West's former colleague, JAY-ZI, also experimented with hyphens and capital letters.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
On Saturday, at Tlatelolko Square, Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, left student movements began to be founded throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
The US should double funding in artificial intelligence
As China is increasing artificial intelligence activity, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, says investor and practices in the field of AI Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were provided after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the United States does not have a formal strategy in the field of AI at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“The dual AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are preparing for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book, AI Overstates: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the Innovation Ventures Foundation, which has invested in Face++, one of the most famous AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player at Otello and was later executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous technology competitions held by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the following would be to help identify the next promising participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the US increase its AI efforts.
“I believe that the Green Card should be automatically offered to candidates of sciences in the field of AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations give money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, it now invests more than $100 million in AI research per year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any steps within months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which will resolve a long-term dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia with the possibility of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments made an agreement based on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the deal argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gheorghe Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and there are doubts over the boycott campaign whether the voter turnout will reach the minimum 50% that will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the referendum bulletin reads: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgievskaya, 79, said in Skopje.
Although the outcome of the vote does not bear legal obligations, enough members of parliament said they would support it to make it decisive.
Two-thirds of the votes in parliament will be required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said that there were no reports of violations until 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary election, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the urns.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old voter Gjoze Tanevsky in the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dushko voted in a referendum on changing the country's name, which will open the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of tents organized by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly raised head, not through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring a lot of necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe the vast majority will vote in favor, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He noted that the result “yes” will be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for.
In order for the referendum to be recognized as valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since its work began last May.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City takes the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling underwent Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City to win 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute of the match looked to funny simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton and found himself in an open field.
Aguero went on to realize that he was surrounded by four greens.
He bypassed one defender, then ran several more on the edge of the penalty Brighton.
He then took the pass to the left, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penalty to give the ball Aguero, who with his right bets launched it into the right part of the gate, defeating the Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at this moment."
But the initial advantage of the sky-blue in this match Premier League was provided by Sterling.
This goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank by Lera Sane.
Leroy made several touches and continued to make Sterling a pass towards a long rod.
A forward of the sky blue threw the ball into the gate just before he slipped beyond.
City will meet with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 Tuesday at Rain Neckar Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Cherzer wants to take points in "Rokis"
Since the Washington Nashville team left the playoffs, there were no significant reasons to wait for another start.
But the rival Cherzer hopes to go to the pitcher slide on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rokis, provided that Rokis still have difficulty going to the playoffs. Now Rokis is one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
Rokis at least has a wild card for winning 5-2 over the Nashionals on Friday night, but are still seeking to consolidate the first division title.
“Despite the fact that we play for nothing, at least we can leave the ball knowing how viewers behave here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve seen for the whole year.
Why don’t I want to participate in this competition?
The Nashionals will still announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to be Scherzer.
Scherzer, for whom it will be the 34th start, served a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, its usually weekend.
The Washington right-handed has a score of 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 out strikes of 220 2/3 inning this season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
The president briefly mentioned the situation around his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the appearance of Republican supporters in the medium-term elections.
“Everything we did will be at stake in November.
In five weeks, there will be some of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones — I don't run, but I really run, so I'm fighting for great candidates wherever I can," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it’s happening now.
And they are firmly determined to regain power using any means, you see meanness, scabbling.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who needs to step over to gain power and control, they want power and control, we are not going to give them.”
The Democrats’ mission, he said, “oppose and hinder.”
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil and mean, vile and false."
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling Democratic Senator Diane Finestein by name, which provoked the audience to loud cries of discontent.
“Remember her answer?
Did you provide a document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting — it was a really bad body language — the worst language of body movements I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was almost no surprise.
After all, I am the last of those Labour members of Parliament who were told that they were not happy, and all this is because we express our opinion.
My colleagues in Parliament Joan Ryan were treated almost the same because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, for Europe. These issues are ironically similar to those under which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A report on Friday's Labour meeting said, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Labour Parliament were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of “more friendly, softer” politics has long been forgotten if it was once begun to be fulfilled at all.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that no different views are allowed in the Labour Party and every opinion is assessed from the standpoint of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues with whom I previously thought I had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take positions I would never agree with, whether it was national security or the only EU market.
Whenever I speak publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I say — this is followed by a tirade of attacks on social media calling for recall, condemning the center's policies, I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because I'm usually political comments.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face daily flows of sexist or racist attacks, but never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of "distrust" or change of selection rules, the party narrows down.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice. I was urged not to be promoted, not to speak so loudly that “everything is fine” with me.
But I didn't come into politics.
I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy because due to the lack of attention from the Thatcher government, my class in high school has literally collapsed, since then I have sought to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether it is a local adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my policy, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was confused by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday events, I want to say only one thing: in conditions when a country moves to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
I actually have another message, but not for Nottingham's Momentum, but for my voters, both Labour Party members and not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats to recall me and no political benefit will prevent me from acting according to what I consider you all the best interests.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament from Nottingham East
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rise up
The last two attempts may have somewhat distorted the end result, but no doubt Air earned a triumph in today's wonderful entertainment match of the Scottish Premiership.
They are now leading the table, this is the only undefeated team out of ten.
After all, excellent defense and improved ability to use chances gives hosts and coach Peter Merchi's full right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested by our games and we're still invincible, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented, "I pay tribute to Air, they used chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, implemented by Frazier Klimo, brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, issued by the Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo strengthened the leadership of Air with the help of a penalty and just before the break made and implemented a solo test, which gave the score of 17-5 in favor of Air
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay due to a serious injury by Roarid Knott, who was taken out of the field on the stretchers, and out of the Ayr restart, broke out forward using Stafford McDowell's attempt, which was implemented by Klimo.
Captain Air Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay Bruce Colwin's unrealized attempt under fierce pressure.
The hosts returned, however, when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the Clemo's grip without a ball from the penalty course line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the Ayr moll.
Klimo realized the attempt he made almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Rowe received a hit in the box from David Armstrong and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the host team.
It seems that the star of the series "All Still Game" is set up for a new career in the restaurant field
It seems that the star of the series "All Still Game" Ford Kiran is set up for a new career in the field of hospitality. This conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, a script for which he writes and in which he starred with longtime comedy partner Greg Hamfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the series, and Kirnan seems to be planning a life after Craigleng.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in Scottish Sun hinted that Kirnan wanted to enter Glasgow's "promising restaurant business".
Our Sea: Internal Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang an ocean-blue flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are painted with the motto: "Our sea is rightfully.
We have to bring him back."
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline that has departed Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict due to natural resources, and there is also a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the strongest in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision on October 1 after five years of consideration of the case.
“There is an impulse in Bolivia, there is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive result,” commented Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will monitor the announcement of the ICJ decision on large screens across the country. They hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, which after decades of fragmentary conversations, Chile will force negotiations to provide Bolivia with a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president who faced opposition against his re-election next year, also places high hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, little will change.
The UN, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to award Chilean territory and noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the ICJ, made only six months after the final arguments were given, indicates that the case was "not difficult," said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Bolivia's case did not advance, the last four years could have contributed to the rollback.
"The issue of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' warrior rhetoric undermined the remains of Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will receive "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and the chance to end 139 years of disagreement, getting mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadia also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the maritime question as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
This ruling is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ree spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore summit by rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the belief that the extension of sanctions and opposed the US declaration to end the Korean War will once bring North Korea to its knees is an "unreal dream".
Washington is afraid to adopt a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant disarmament steps.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning its arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive hats, which is already heading to the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of eccentric oversize-style hats from the spring-summer 2019 collection at the events of the brilliant Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their dizzying creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagant beige hat with wide feathered fields that closed the heads of the models.
Among other oversize accessories are decorated with precious stones watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even ananas hat, but they are not to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated a range of original masks — very timely before Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had sewn lips and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled equipment for scuba diving with a tube and glasses, the other looked like a horn of ice cream that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you are lucky.
Stylists say huge hats can take to the main streets of your city.
Oversize capeluchs entered fashion thanks to "La Bambi", a straw hat with fields sixty centimeters wide, which was seen at all: from Rihanna to Emily Ratazhkowski.
The cult brand behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks gave peace another creation: a straw beach bag the size of almost like a model in a swimsuit that carried it.
A bag of yellowish-red reef with frafia fringe and white leather handle was the central element of the collection of La Riviera spring-summer 2019 brand Jacquesmus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is mandatory for the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools maintain high standards of study, and in 2018 excellent exam results were again obtained, which are complemented by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other areas.
These schools, which have over 30,000 students across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SRN). They seek to provide the best level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career, as well as make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak a person to a language they understand, he perceives it with his mind.
If you speak her native language to her, she perceives it with her heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot only use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year’s exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are leading in the ratings of subjects with the best grades.
Overall, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score of A.
Data collected in 74 schools in SRNSH showed that 72% of students received a higher score of A from Chinese, and another 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French, and 63% of those studying Spanish also received A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages as a subject of choice are now taught in the same way as NTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), within independent school programs and in other institutions.
A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of the reasons employers could not close vacancies related to language skills lack.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more promising positions require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of his chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it is a skill for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages, an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey conducted among more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people (15%).
That’s why investing in language teaching is now important for modern children.
Knowing several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding a full job.
In Scotland, each school will learn their own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important to the UK from a 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always choose multiple languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed regardless of what the future has prepared for them.
It cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be considered “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron debuts with Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see Lebron James's first start for the Los Angeles Lakers almost waited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play, it has not yet been decided.
"It will be more than one or less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games of the Lakers schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he replied.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election rallies from Willing, West Virginia today.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including rallies in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy he proposed to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump seeks to form support for the upcoming medium-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What hour will Trump’s evening rally in West Virginia take place and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wiling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump will likely mention the tense hearings that took place this week over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of Senate voting for a week while an FBI investigation continues.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans with gaining popularity before the November election.
President Trump said the five rallies next week were aimed at "activizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
“The control over Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, as a tense election campaign season is approaching,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who did not want to give his name.
At the planned Vesbanko Arena Stadium in Wiling today's rally can come by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a state in which he won more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrizy, whose rating lags behind by polls.
"It's not good for Morrizi that the president is coming to raise his rating in polls," commented Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and full of hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended in a one-way victory, afternoon Saturdays could become exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
The lustful pendulum of momentum is a completely fictional sports concept that players really believe in, especially in similar competitions.
So when do they say the impulse is acting?
"They were six points ahead, and now it's four, so I think we're taking it a little bit like an impulse," Jordan Spit said when he came in.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their sails, and they also encourage a lot, not least the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
Spiting with his killer blows from those site to green shows an example.
These larynary cries of the celebration became louder when he made a decisive patch in the continuation of his round and equalized the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas behind two points.
His patta, who allowed them to win the match at the 15 hole, was met with a similar scream, one who tells you that the American team doesn't seem to.
"You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match," Spit said.
That’s all that each of these players has left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't make boggys on Saturday afternoon, they also managed to avoid boggy on Saturday and afternoon on Friday and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and backwards to believe they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players other than Fleetwood or Molinari to consolidate the potential victory of Europeans when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
Both are desirable at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about the triumph of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt with Sergio Garcia, a hero of morning forbols when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bohgi and two dubles on the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swedes to the hole, from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to watch close to the interaction between the participants of the couple, through the tips they give, advice they do not give, and it is also interesting to observe how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe is still playing better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this force sessions have also shown that the US team intends to fight, which some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday forbols and forcemas it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the lagging Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
Thomas Bjorne's European team, which is trying to return the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forbols with a score of 3-1.
The United States resisted more in force and won two matches, but failed to cut the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four consecutive points, while he and Mollinari (with Mollywood) after the sensational weekend are only the second pair to score four points in the first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in forbols, they teamed up to defeat the bloated Woods and American beginner Bryson Deschambo with even more spectacular 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed random outbursts of genius, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in forbols and forcemas and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who was not involved in the morning forbols, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in forcemas to get a 2th1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe has failed to do everything in its own pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three times the main winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday set the standard for Americans with their two points.
They received a decisive 2th1 victory over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in forbols and later defeated Paulter and Rory McLroy with a score of 4th3 in forcemas, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder's Cup history, the team returned with a four-point deficit in singles, although Furika's team only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it can’t.
North Korea says it will “no way” be disarmed unilaterally without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens distrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country would in no way be able to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea took “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and a commitment not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see the appropriate reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement proved important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ree referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking the formal end of the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must initially abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization at first’ and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal forcibly, and even object to ‘declaring the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“To believe that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the extension of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ree did not mention the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, at which the US leader stressed at the UN early the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not go into such a dead end."
Despite this, the tone of Ree's speech was sharply different from last year when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after Trump called Kim a "missile man" who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, Trump, who threatened to “fully destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said much more needs to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea’s denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that he did not set a time frame for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and steadily until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ree on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but hours later North Korea condemned him for "gangster demands".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to disassemble the missile system as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim said he needed “appropriate measures” are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how enough to relax
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all its students with more sleep. It is an attempt to deal with a growing culture of learning all night after filling caffeine.
The teacher found that the number one university students in the world are often ignorant when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
In the end, one girl approached him and said, "Why am I being told this now, in the last year?"
"She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," a teacher from The Telegraph shared.
In the course, which was first introduced this year, students are explained the basics of how good sleep habits help achieve academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s medical services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep for a week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section contains images of a room in a hostel where students click cups of coffee, curtains, simulators and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deficiency on sports performance, and the importance of sleep-related routine.
Another section tells participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have the right to know about the effects of smoking cigarettes for health,” added Professor Chaseler.
A culture of pride in “sleeping all night” still exists, he added, and noted that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with excess weight, since sleep deprivation translates the brain into a mode of hunger, which causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler develop the course after enrolling for one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all graduate students with a request to undergo a similar program of study before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chaseler recommends that students should go to bed, as well as put an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, which leads to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerrard's boys
Rangers survived another attack of outbound sadness: Dolly Menga's blow brought Stephen Gerrard's disparished team defeat 1-0 from Livingston.
The Ibrox team sought to win their first win at the away match after the February triumph over St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard a second defeat as manager of 18 games. Gerrard's team remained eight points behind Scottish Premiership leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers warehouse, who lacked inspiration, did not look like it could equalize the score.
Now "Rangers has fallen to sixth position, and Livingston has risen to the third, and only Hibernian is ahead of the balls in the ball.
In addition, Rangers may be faced with another trouble, because lineman Kalum Spence was forced to process the head wound after he was thrown into some object from the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once passed by the Air to the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
And Holt released the same lineup, "Left 11," who took one point at Harts last week, and was delighted with how his forced guys squeezed rivals at every step.
Rangers may have dominated the ball's possession, but Livingston worked more with the ball.
They were to score just two minutes later when Menga's first pass into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted this big chance by sending the ball past the gate.
Keagan Jacobs' deep free blow got by clipper Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgou hit the back bar
Rangers did get control, but there were more hopes on the last third than believing in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should be eligible for a penalty at a quarter of an hour after colliding with Stephen Lawles, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed to make only two beats at the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly hit Lassana Kulibali's head and Ovie Edjara's calm blow almost did not bother.
And although Livingston's first goal in 34 minutes may have been contrary to the game's course, no one can deny that they deserved it only with their hard work.
Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' preparations.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for a simple ending.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the winger broke to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came from his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to force guests to play exactly the game they like when Litgou and Halkett make one long pass after another.
Holt's team could improve the result in recent stages, but McGregor resisted Jacobs well before Litgou hit from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement at Rangers, made another late penalty application when he encountered Jacobs, but Thomson took the look again.
Almanac: inventor of Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time is coming... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the counting Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Crownado Bells with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play questionable cowboys-scientists.
Man: "What is it at all?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear how radioactivity affects atoms in minerals."
Evans: "Well, it's really cracking right now!"
Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, which is part of treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancer. Next, these cells are reintroduced to the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared by more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can "see" common protein (HER2) for many types of cancer, and further re-entering these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of several cancers,’ including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colorectal cancer,” he explained.
A similar approach, which consists in removing immune cells in patients and “teaching” them aimed at cancer cells, worked in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show in the MAGA baseball cap, Kanye West knocked out with a sharp speech in support of President Trump.
What caused a negative reaction of the audience
Viewers in the studio show SNL (Saturday Night Live) mastered Kanye after his sad performance, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball cap with the inscription "Let's bring America back to former glory," he exploded with a tirade in which he criticized Democrats, and again stated his support for Trump.
"Often during the conversation, whites ask me, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, which he gave before the Senate Legal Committee in the case of Christine Blasey Ford's lawsuit for sexual violent acts.
Although West's speech was not broadcast live, a video with his tirade was posted on social networks comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to make fun of Vesta by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes with him had an unpleasant situation due to the headgear.
West said, “When I was behind the scenes, I was rudely treated.
I was told, "Don't go to the audience in this baseball cap."
They abused me!
And then I'm told I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'll wear my Superman baseball cap because so no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to continue moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
According to the weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction of the audience in the hall, and the actors of the SNL show looked confused. One of the audience said the following: "The studio was dominated by dead silence."
Vesta was last minute invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the air.
West caused many surprise by performing the song I Love it (I love it) in the Perrier water bottle suit.
Vesta was supported by the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Kendez Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest: THANK FOR WHAT IS AGAINST THE NATOVPU."
Instead, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
“However, I will not reward that (buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’), who I think professes and erupts an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she added.
Before performing on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: now he "one who was previously known as Kanye West."
West is not the first performer to change his name. He follows Diddy's example, also known as Puff Deaddy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dog was formerly called Snoop Lyon, and the musical legend of recent decades Prince changed its name to symbol and then became "Artist formerly known as Prince".

Game of Thrones star Keith Gerington condemns idealization of brutality
Keith Gerington became famous for his role as a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor of performances condemning the stereotype of the hero-macho, claiming that because of such heroes on screens, it often seems that they should become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith stated that, in his opinion, "something went wrong", and asked how to solve the problem of idealization of brutality in the era of popularity of the hashtag ?MeTo (?as well, ?ath, etc.).
Keith, who recently married his fellow Game of Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, noted that he was "very determined" to fight the problem.
"I am very determined at the moment. When did we stand on the slippery path of idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up through the prism of the problem we are seeing now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He continued, "What is natural and what is planted for us?
Why does television and the street teach that young guys feel pressure to be just such men?
I think the question is “How can we change this?”
It is obvious that the young guys have gone from the right path.”
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any prequelas and sequels of Game of Thrones after the series was completed next summer, because he "has already ended battles and horses."
Since November, Keith will play in the production of the play “True West” by Sam Shepard, a story about a film producer and his brother-player.
As an actor recently admitted, he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best he received from participating in the series Game of Thrones.
“During the filming of this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life,” Keith said.
In a fantasy series that won Emmy awards, Rose played Igritt - the love of the hero Herington John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018. The ceremony was held on the territory of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has a sharp increase in 14% of the number of new cases of the disease
China has announced a sharp increase of 14% of the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, in total, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in the past trend.
For a long time in some regions of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to official health officials during a conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission sexually on time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men subsequently marry women because of the country’s domination of conservative values.
Transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of protective equipment during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV medicines, seeing it as a way to partially solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the downing of Republican senators’ data on the network by her full-time employee and exposes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory”
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned unfounded statements that one of her full-time employees had posted personal data from three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Los Angeles Democrat says the statements spread “ultraright” political observers and websites.
“Breaking, lies, and then even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
Data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during hearings in the Senate Commission over charges of sexual abuses brought against Brett Kavano, a candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The data leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source of the leak is related to the Waters office and it managed to find the data of its full-time employee.
“These baseless statements are absolutely not true, they are not true,” Waters continued.
“The employee of my office, whose personal data and security are at risk as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the leakage of this information.
These baseless statements are absolutely not true, they do not correspond to reality.
Waters was quickly criticized online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleisher wrote.
“This suggests that with this character she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, you don’t have to be angry.
The accused should not behave presumptuously.
He should not ask about the motives of the one who is accusing.
He must remain calm and unbreakable.”
Fleisher appears to have drawn parallels between Waters' reaction and Democratic criticism to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who runs to take Waters' seat as a midterm election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“This is news if everything is really true,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had already informed "appropriate state bodies and law enforcement agencies of these false statements."
“We will do everything we can to find the perpetrators,” she continued, “and they responded before the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees.”
Review of the film "Johnny English: A New Mission" - passing parody of spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look in every new British film senses, inspired by Brexit. There are also in a new part of the series of comedy parodies for the militants about Johnny English. The first film called "Johnny English" was released back in 2003, later the series was resumed in 2011, filming "Johnny English: Overrun".
Will there be a mocking and ironic self-satur to what we are under the nation’s new export potential?
Anyway, Johnny English with his moving face and pricked eyes was given the opportunity to make a mess for a second time, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comic character is created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a heartlessly fun secret agent, in which, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, is a little from Inspector Cluzo, a little from Mr. Bean and a lot from the guy who played one note of the melody from the film "Fire chariots" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The character's prototype is also a traveler and mystery of international scale, which has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's long-forgotten television advertising.
There are a few good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I liked the scene when Johnny English in knightly armor was approaching the helicopter, and the screw blades were zencing against his helmet.
The film well reveals Atkinson's talent to arrange a buffonade, but humor is passed, and at some points it is too much, especially if compared with "serious" film brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible", one of the "ingreedients" of which is also comedy.
It seems that jokes are designed for children rather than adults, and I have the senseless misfortunes that happen to Johnny English do not seem as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson's wits in silent Bean films.
As always, the film begins with the fact that there is a serious threat over the UK.
In the British supersecret network of spies penetrates a hacker and reveals the names of all field agents, which was a complete surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an occasional role in the film).
This turned out to be the last drop for the prime minister, a haughty person who has already been criticized and is in deep depression due to a loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to convey the image inspired by Theresa May, but the script did not allow to fully reveal it).
Intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needs to involve one of the retired.
The choice falls on the awkward Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at some super-fashionable institution and unofficially teaches children operational work undercover (in this part with the spy "school of the year" English for teenagers there were several successful jokes).
English is quickly delivered to Whitegol for an urgent briefing, where he meets his long-suffering friend Buff, once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the submarine captain (the role of an exalted annoying person is not entirely in line with Vicky Pepperdin's talent).
So, when everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service went squerebert, Batman and Robin return to line and suddenly meet the fatal woman Ophelia the Gun, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister falls under the charms of a charismatic billionaire who earned his fortune in the field of technology and technology and claims that he can eliminate the problem with the British network, the villained Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on a journey and again resort to their ridiculous pranks: dressed by waiters they make a fire in a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally traveling abroad on the luxury yacht Volta; English arranges a real mess when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet.
All stops lead us to the last episode, but by his good-nature and frenzy, it resembles a movie for children.
Passing film.
As with other films about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: Can the British film industry offer Roven Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies preparing a plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is due to discuss a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days.
The party wants to oblige company executives to transfer funds saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, employees, providing them with an additional weekend.
Thus, workers will have a three-day weekend and at the same time bring home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will correspond to the economic program of the party and direct the country's resources to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved at the British Trade Union Congress. It is seen that in this way workers will be able to benefit from changing the general economic situation.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
Labour was not the first to approve this idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of such a desire.
The speaker of the Labour Party said: “The party’s political program does not provide for the introduction of a four-day working week, so we are not considering this idea now.”
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party election convention last week.
Mr McDonnell said he was set to take back power from “faceless directors” of utilities and “exhibiters.”
The “shadow” Chancellor’s plan also means that shareholders of water supply companies may not receive their share of capital if the Labour government introduces a “deferment” on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed his intentions to include workers in the board of companies and create inclusive stock funds to transfer 10% of ordinary shares of private sector firms to workers waiting for annual dividends of up to ?500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell the show 60 Minutes (60 minutes) whether the investigation of the case of Kavanaugh, which is leading by the FBI, can change their mind.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavano, which is leading by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a Supreme Court judge was postponed for at least a week. The question arises whether Republican senators will continue to continue to support Kavanaugh after the results of the investigation of the bureau were published.
In Sunday's 60 Minutes show, correspondent Scott Pelli asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
During the hearing, I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it all happened and that charge came out, asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, unshakable, uncompromising."
It seems that Graham’s opinion will not change anything.
“I believe that the indictment of Kavano is a provocation,” he said.
“Doctor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
And everyone she calls cannot confirm it under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event in the music world with a stunning number of star artists and an equally striking mission to overcome poverty around the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will vote on the Great lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, and to draw attention to the true goal of the festival - the organizers seek to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors must perform a number of tasks or "acts", such as taking part in a volunteer project, write an email to the world leader, make a phone call or anything else to help draw attention to the organization's goal - eradicating poverty.
So are there any results, because the Global Citizen organizers have 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert for an act is a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, is it just another case of so-called “clictitism” when people feel that they are really changing something by signing an electronic petition or posting on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “acts” of their supporters aimed at achieving various goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programs worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 financial obligations and public statements as an example, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
The group estimates that the funds provided have already directly affected the lives of approximately 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main financial obligations can be mentioned by The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to the UK. As part of the project, investors and implementers committed to “help children grow up” and promised to provide Rwanda with $ 35 million in assistance to overcome the problem of malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 messages on Twitter from the Global Citizens organization.
“With the support of the UK government, patrons, governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history,” said Tracy Ullman, a spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
After 5,000 “acts” calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced the allocation of funds for The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website "Why do you think you can overcome the extreme poverty rate?",
Global Citizen said: “It’s a long and difficult path, so sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
However, like the participants in the civil rights movements and against apartheid towards us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janell Mona are only a part of the star artists who will perform at the New York Festival this year, and will be led by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
Interior Secretary said the United States could use naval forces to ‘blockade’ to prevent Russian energy exports from being exported.
According to U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, cited in the Washington Examiner, “if necessary,” Washington may seek help from the naval forces to prevent Russian energy resources from entering markets, including the markets of the Middle East.
Zinke said Russia’s participation in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to become an intermediary in energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
“Thanks to the US naval forces, it can provide free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke appealed to the participants of the event, which was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance (Alliance of Energy Consumers), a non-profit organization that positions itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy effectively and replace them alternative,” he said, calling Russia “unilaterally developed” because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these statements were heard, the Trump administration has set a goal to increase compressed natural gas exports to Europe, displacing the Russian-born energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To do this, Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “unappropriate” project to build the Nord Stream 2 route, which Trump said will make Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, the cost of which is $ 11 billion and which will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin is convinced that Washington is strongly opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we share the view that energy resources cannot be a tool of pressure and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Secretary Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, which took place in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading industry organization Federal Union of German Industry (BDI) urged the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like it when a third country interferes in our energy supplies,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Union of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will “seriously think” about running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he would "seriously think" about running for president after the midterm election.
During a public meeting in Goliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering nomination.
According to The Hill Warren said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up the work of the government, and there should be a woman at its head.”
“After November 6, I will seriously think about nomination for president.”
During a public meeting, Warren expressed her assessment of Donald Trump’s presidency, saying he was “leading his country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank, criticizing Trump and his proposed candidacy for the post of Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday tweet, Warren wrote, "...no doubt, before the vote, the FBI must conduct an investigation."
However, according to a survey released on Friday, most Warren voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a survey jointly conducted by the Suffolk University Center for Political Studies and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential voters in Massachusetts opposed the senator's nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The results of the survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoys greater support. For his potential nomination for the post of President, 38% expressed against - 48%.
During the discussions of candidates of other well-known Democrats who may run in 2020, also referred to as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Paylin during a rally in support of Donald Trump
Trek Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence. The incident occurred on Monday night.
“What my son is now going through, which he goes after returning, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers are returning home,” she said in front of the rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said her son and other war veterans "return home not as they were before, more violent, and want to know if their brother soldiers, pilots and other military personnel have done here."
According to a spokesman for the police department of Wasilla, Dan Bennett, Treka was arrested on Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as that he prevented reports of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication.
18 States and the District of Columbia support asylum policy appeal
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the appeal of the new U.S. policy, according to which victims of bandit persecution and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note by a court consultant to Washington to support the plaintiff in need of asylum and appealed the policy in court.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions on the lawsuit of the American Civil Rights Union, which challenges federal policy and which was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The plaintiff said her partner "and his violent gang sons" had beaten her, but U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace’s lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees of whom often seek asylum in the United States) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy reverses the decision of the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board, according to which immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, General Carl Reisin, said during his speech on Friday that the new policy "ignored decades of state laws, federal and international laws."
“The federal law requires that decisions on applications for refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the ban violates this principle,” the court consultant said in an analytical note.
In the analytical note, prosecutors argue that policies that prohibit immigrants from entering the United States harms the country’s economy, as they could potentially become entrepreneurs and “replenish the necessary labor resources.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order for immigration judges in June that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“The shelter is provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views,” Sessions said during the presentation of the policy on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to solve all the troubles, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers are desperately trying to find those left alive, while the death toll in Palu has doubled
For those who are alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
“The situation is very tense,” says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulance brings bodies.
There is not enough clean water.”
Some residents return to their destroyed homes, take over melted benefits, trying to save what they found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the earthquake, whose strength was 7.5 points on the Richter scale, are crowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Geris with a fracture of the back and shoulder, rest near the building of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are provided with open-air assistance due to constant repeated tremors.
His eyes were filled with tears when he recalled how a strong push shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was squeezed among the wreckage of the wall,” Geris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife begging for help and then the silence prevailed.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “implementing psychological pressure” with “advertising that contains propaganda”
A week after a state-owned Chinese newspaper posted advertising material on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China on four pages of the American daily publication, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid app of the publication China Daily in Des Moines Register - the most popular newspaper in Iowa after accusing China of trying to influence the congressional elections, which will be held on November 6. China rejects these accusations.
According to Reuters officials in the United States, Trump’s statements, in which he accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the US election, meant a new phase of escalation by Washington, whose goal is to pressure China.
While foreign governments can place ads to intensify trade, there is an escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, in which they have already increased import duties.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of repressive duties in China was aimed at striking exporters from states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, China’s largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Branstead wrote in a Sunday edition column of Des Moines Register, "enforces pressure by publishing propaganda-containing ads in our independent press."
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the way for the American people’s tradition of freedom of speech and press independence, placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register,” Bransted wrote.
"In contrast, on street layouts here in Beijing, you find only individual voices of dissenters. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people are actually thinking about the direction of development of the Chinese economy, which is of concern, which can be concluded that the Chinese media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respected Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of Kavanano Republicans set up women voters against themselves before the midterm elections
Since many prominent Republicans support and defend Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after he has been charged with several sexual harassment charges, analysts warn that this could cause an undesirable reaction ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, especially in women.
Passions are raging around this situation, and most Republicans publicly declare that they would like to move on to the vote.
Such things then can’t just be played back,” Grant Reeger, a professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University, said in an interview with The Hill.
Riger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, which Senator Jeff Flake (a Republican from Arizona) began to insist at the last minute, would be enough to calm angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., chief adviser and spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn (Muiet further), Catherine Jean-Perrier said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget about it either tomorrow or November.”
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters sang "November is approaching!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when Republicans decided to move on to the approval of Cavano's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
In an interview with the news website Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political observer, said: “People will be extremely interested and motivated.”
“They say that’s the case now, and that’s true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in women voters aged 18-29 with a suburbs who have not yet decided and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford testified in connection with the charges of a candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge in sexual crime, analysts predicted a negative reaction of voters if Republicans insisted on approval.
Earlier this week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said, “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
As noted in an interview with the news channel, Director of Priorities USA (U.S. Priorities) (a group that helps in the Democratic election campaign) Guy Cecil, "the case is not in a committee vote, a final vote, or that Kavanano found himself on the bench of defendants, but in how they reacted to this situation and how they acted on."
Yet the thoughts of Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavanaugh, are divided. Ford has a little more support.
According to the results of a new survey from YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe the testimony of Ford, while Kavano believes or rather believes 35% of respondents.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that, in their opinion, Kavanano gave or most likely gave false testimony, while 30% of respondents said the same thing.
According to The Guardian, after the insistences of Flake, the FBI conducts a check of the charges brought by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Legal Committee on how Kavanaugh attacked her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez said the candidate for the position of Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world Internet plans to launch a “new Internet” to create competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create competition between Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of the world of technology, Inrupt, is developing an open source platform Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and to whom to provide access to one or another information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
It is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology that will allow users to create a "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can store contact lists, lists of current cases, calendar, audio recording library and other tools for their own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify in one browser at the same time.
A unique feature of this personal online data storage is that it fully meets the needs of a user who can access any information.
The company calls it “expansion of personal capabilities through data.”
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company aims to use resources, processes and relevant skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete replacement when all their business models undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Saturday publication on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to “ensure commercial energy and the ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network based on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: celebration on the presentation of the representative of the church of the Order of Victoria Cross during the First World War
The only representative of the Church of England, who received the Order of the Victoria Cross for his participation in hostilities during the First World War, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel St. Bernard Vann received an award for participating in the attack near Belglis and Leocourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he died from a sniper bullet four days later and never learned that he received Britain's highest military award.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called "extremely symbolic" that the opening of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through the Saint-Katen Canal "through a very thick fog and under the dense fire of field guns and machine guns."
Later he hurried to the fire frontier and with "desperate bravery" led the line forward, before that one broke through to the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Bath shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather had done something he himself could never repeat and deserve respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very proud of being involved in this parade" and added that "the courage of the real hero demonstrates the honor that so many people show him."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead they were shown “Peppe Pig”
Imagine that you don’t sleep all night just to watch the event-rich Bellator 206 tournament, and you are denied the opportunity to view the main event.
The tournament posters held in San Jose showed 13 fights, including six matches of the main program, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just before Hegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in the UK froze by surprise when a pig Peppe appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the battle.
Some viewers were not delighted with this because they did not sleep until the morning waiting for the fight.
One of the fans tweeted that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some kind of unsuccessful joke."
“According to the government’s ruling, the content broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to launch a children’s broadcast,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and public relations when asked about the TV broadcast,” said Bellator.
"Peppa Pig, yes".
Bellator President Scott Cocker has promised to work on a broadcast schedule to reach viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think if we talk about repeating the broadcast, we can arrange it,” Cocker said.
“But now there is Sunday, 6 a.m., and we will not be able to do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received many messages that we answered, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical malfunction, and we tried to eliminate it.
However, it turned out that this was a discrepancy with government regulations.
I can promise you that this will not happen anymore.
We'll cut the tournament to five fights instead of six as usual. We tried to redirect the signal to fans, but so far we have postponed these attempts.
It’s a really unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'worst' than others because of his sexual orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he did not realize that "not everyone is like him" until he went to high school.
Taking part in the program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lovern, he noted that he spoke frankly about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that due to parenthood, he became less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The host who has been conducting this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for several months.
Coming as a pariah on Lavern's first program, Daley said he felt "worst" than others as a child because "the society did not accept when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "Until now, the feeling of inferiority and difference was exactly what gave me the inspiration and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that something is “worthy” so as not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a well-known LGBT rights activist and took advantage of the appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke frankly about his views because he felt happy with what he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
Three-time world champion admitted that the feeling of man, American filmmaker Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise for him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” (at the first Olympic Games he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it is difficult to find someone of his age who would also survive similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and since then, according to Daley, his "world perception" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would only think about getting gold,” he said.
“You know, there are things much more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept the idea of the end and asked before his death if they had purchased tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you won’t sit in the front row because you won’t be around anymore,” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I knew that this was what I dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of my compatriots at the Olympic Games, and there was no feeling better than that,” Daley said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song - Proud (Pride) performed by Heather Small - who resonated with him in preparation for the Olympic Games and still evokes ants.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 English summer time.
On Saturday, Michelson was withdrawn from the tournament match for the Ryder Cup, who was not in shape.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup tournament, but he must restore shape so that this event does not become unhappy for him.
Michelson, who in the record 12th time participates in the tournament, which takes place every two years, led Captain Jim Furik out of the game for the time of forbols and nozzles.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained aside, hoping to master emotions.
Since Michelson was not famous for his good blows even while at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete was not quite suitable for the difficult Le Golf National golf course, where the reef usually punishes for wandering blows.
And if the field is not such an obstacle, in the ninth match on Sunday Michelson will have to meet with the champion of the Open Championship and the master of the exact blow Francesco Molinari, who paired with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all his matches this week.
If Americans who lag behind three points after 12 single matches start well, Michelson's match can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and, probably, besides this he had nothing to add.
“He fully understood his role today, splashed me on the back, hugged and said that tomorrow would be ready,” Furik said.
“He has no doubt about his abilities.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Fame who has done so much for teams last week and this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play in two games.
I predicted more games, but it worked out, and so we decided to act like that.
He wants to be there, on the field, like anyone else."
If Michelson goes on the field on Saturday, he will break Nick Faldo's record, who played the largest number of matches in the Ryder Cup tournament.
At this he may end his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which never matched his individual achievements.
Michelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 draw results, however Furik said his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
“He’s funny, eatful, witty, likes to joke with others, he’s a guy who’s cool to have on the team,” Furik explained.
“I think the younger players had good fun coming to him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He is more than just a player.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorne knows that a big break does not solve anything
Thomas Bjorne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a tangible break in front of the last day of the tournament for the Ryder Cup does not yet guarantee victory.
Datchanin made his debut in 1997 in a game on the Valderram Club, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but won the match with a slight margin with a score of 141-2:131-2.
“You remind yourself that we had a big break in the Valderram field match; a big break in Brooklein where we lost, and on the field of Walderras, where we hardly won,” Bjorn said after watching the winning games of Class 2018 with 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break was 10:6.
History teaches me and every team player that nothing has yet been decided.
Tomorrow we have to play with maximum dedication.
Go to the field and do everything you need.
The game will only be completed after the result appears on the scoreboard.
We have a goal to get this trophy, and that’s what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of who opposes us - the best players in the world.
Satisfied with his players' performance on a complex field, Bjorn added, "I'll never run ahead.
Tomorrow it could be different.
Tomorrow we are waiting for individual matches, and that’s something else.
It’s great to play on the field with your partner when things go well, but it’s when you’re standing there alone and you can check what you’re worth as a golfer.
Here’s how to set up players to perform tomorrow: on the verge of opportunities.
You leave your partner without support and now he also has to show what he is capable of.”
Unlike Bjorne, the opposite number Jim Furrick expects his partners to play on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spice and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fourk's fate returned to various sides on the last day: he was among the winners in Brookline, but was defeated when a team from Europe created the Miracle in Medina.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Cranshaw, the captain of the team in 1999, organized players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow. But we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklain and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone's side, players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We have placed players in the team as if we were going to do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counteroffensive in the top match against Rory McIllroy. Next, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter were included in the first half of the list of Europeans.
“It was these partners in this order that I chose because I want to evenly distribute efforts throughout the game,” Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The new German battleship was postponed again
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was to be put into operation in 2014 instead of outdated Cold War combat vessels. However, according to local media information, this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and a rapid increase in costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from a spokesman of the military department, the introduction of the ship "Rainland-Palatinz", the main vessel of the series of the most modern frigates of the Baden-Wurtemberg class, postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery caused the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Wurttemberg class, which the naval department ordered in 2007, are to replace the outdated frigates of the Bremen class.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies to reduce visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical support. It is expected that new frigates will not be able to return to the database port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warn that due to constant delays, state-of-the-art warships that were to strengthen Germany’s military power at sea will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The long-suffering frigate F125 came into the headlines last year when the German naval forces officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a warship returned to a shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant “software and equipment defects”, through which the combat vessel became unsuitable for military operations.
Software disadvantages are particularly important, since the crew of the Baden-Wurttemberg-class ship consists of about 120 sailors - this is only half of the number of military personnel who served on the old frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel has a significant excess of weight, which worsens its performance and limits the capabilities for further modernization.
The Reinland Palatz frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7,000 tons) for ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the price of training the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros have turned into a colossal 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion US dollars).
Problems with obtaining new frigates have gained particular weight in light of recent warnings about the decline of Germany's naval forces.
Earlier the year, the authorized Bundestag for the armed forces Hans-Peter Bartels said that the country's Navy "has had few ships suitable for combat missions."
The official said the situation had deteriorated rapidly over time, as old vessels were out of operation and new ones were not coming.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wurtemberg class were able to replenish the navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study conducted on land ownership in the Scottish Highlands aims to establish how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data obtained will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to carry out measures to preserve them in the future.
In the gardens of Inveryu in Wester Ross, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe such species as netopir dwarf and netopir pygmey, as well as eared ordinary and water night.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations in land ownership to observe bat behavior during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and affiliation of bat screams.
It is then planned to develop a detailed residence card of animals and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, an adviser on nature protection at the National Trast of Scotland, hopes the results of the study will help determine which areas of residence are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help assess the effectiveness of habitat care measures (for example, the formation of meadows) and determine the optimal methods for preserving forests for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations have declined significantly in Scotland and in the UK.
They are threatened with active construction and development of territories, which deprives them of nesting places.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, adhesive paper for flies, chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
The bats are not actually blind.
However, due to night hunting, ears more effectively help them catch prey than their eyes.
They use a complex echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on the flight trajectory.
The National Trast of Scotland, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of particular importance and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, take bat problems very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, nesting site checks, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The efforts of the organization even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland. It is located on the territory of the town of Triv in the Dumfries and Galloway region. It found refuge for eight of the ten species of bats living in Scotland.
The host manager David Thompson claims that this is the perfect place for them.
“There were excellent conditions for bats on the territory of the city,” he assures.
“There are old buildings, many giant trees and other favorable living conditions.
However, we still need to learn a lot about bats. Thanks to the research we conduct here and elsewhere, we will be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for bats before any technical work, since due to the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the removal of young, up to 400 females with cubs can die, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law. Animals are prohibited to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Center, urged the public to join the organization's efforts.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats. We have not yet revealed the characteristics of populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against a German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges "defam" and said people "trying to attract attention" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information about suspicions.
American Catherine Majorga accused Portuguese forward and Juventus football club of rape, which occurred in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to Der Spiegel magazine on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $75,000 for silence.
Hours after the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo appealed to 142 million of his fans in the Instagram video broadcast, calling the relevant messages "defamation".
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today’s accusations are slander,” the statement was made on camera by a five-time owner of the “Golden Ball”.
“They want to get attention using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to make money on me, but such situations are part of my work.
I am a happy person and I am fine,” added the footballer, smiling.
According to Reuters news agency Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for published charges, which they called “an unacceptable report of suspicion of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Sherz said the footballer would demand compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is likely one of the most notorious cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
The incident is claimed to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player number, where he allegedly raped her anal. Such testimony was transferred to the Clark County District Court (Nevada).
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to her knees and said he was "99 percent good guy" who was brought down by "one percent".
As stated in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital, where her injuries were photographed. However, later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because she was "fear of revenge" and wasware of "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel the previous arrangement as she continues to suffer from an incident she said had taken place.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was preparing to move to Real Madrid FC from Manchester United FC. This summer he became a player of the grand of Italian football, Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will “longly regret” the loss of automakers
The UK will “longly regret” if it loses the status of world leader in the field of automotive production after Brexit. This is warned by Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was excited by a statement by Toyota UK representatives who told BBC that in the event of Britain’s exit from the EU without a deal, the company would be forced to suspend the production and operation of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Minister Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Bernaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU urgently at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s CEO in Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how the UK’s exit from the EU will affect without a deal on international trade.
BMW said the Mini plant in Oxford will be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are that no-deal Brexit could cause risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in operational delivery of parts and materials according to needs - parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be interruptions in the supply of parts at the border, which will lead to delays and shortages of materials.
As noted in the company, in the warehouse Toyota you can place parts no more than one day. So production will have to be stopped.
Greg Clark noted that in terms of organizing relations with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), “separately provides for schemes to avoid problems at the border.”
"We need an agreement. We need to conclude the optimal agreement, which, in my opinion, will allow not only to succeed in the current moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the program Today on BBC Radio 4.
“Given the testimony of Toyota representatives as well as other automakers, we need to maintain the formed high-performance supply chains.”
Toyota has failed to report how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, they expect increased costs to reduce the plant’s competitiveness and, as a result, will reduce jobs.
Peter Tsaluris, chairman of the Unite Trade Union's organizing committee at a plant in Bernaston, which worked here for 24 years, said that other participants are extremely concerned: "From experience, I can say that reduced jobs are not being restored."
The government official said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan to form our future relations with the EU.”
Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could be postponed again, White House said
White House officials said Sunday that Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “defer another week” while discussions continue to nominate Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of Supreme Court judge.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in elections, links between Trump and Russia aides, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For months, Washington has been discussing the likelihood of the dismissal of the deputy attorney general, which will jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about using microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the president’s powers on the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House amid reports that the official was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "would not" release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence over time with a meeting of the Senate Legal Committee, where Kavanaugh was to testify and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the Senate vote.
Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, performed on the Fox News Sunday television show.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting is not scheduled. Perhaps it will take place this week. I expect that it will be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I'm constantly making sure that the press has the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders has not held media briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that frequent briefings were not related to the dislike of the "game to the public" by television reporters, although she added, "I will not deny that they are playing the public."
She then suggested that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
“The president answers questions more often than any president to him,” she said, adding, not referring to the source, “Statistics speaks for itself.”
Sanders said the briefings will still be held, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the US president, it's better than talking to me."
We try to communicate with the press often. This should be especially noticeable over the past few weeks. The opportunity to talk to the US president is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why it is so, acting in front of journalists and sometimes weird.
Scottish Health Secretary of State addresses letter to EU workers over concerns over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health addressed citizens of other EU countries working for the National Health Service of Scotland to express gratitude for their work and ask to continue it after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of applications for permanent migrant status for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman noted: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued on the issue of exit. This autumn, relevant decisions should be expected.
But the UK government is strengthening preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know this period can be very disturbing to you.
That is why I would like to emphasize again how I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and countries abroad share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving the work of the health care service for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercrombi underwent urgent surgery after head injury
The midfielder of the Tennessee State Tigers team Christion Ebercrombi underwent an urgent operation after receiving a head injury in a Sunday match against Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost with a score of 31:27. This was reported by a journalist of Tennessee.
Tennessee's head coach State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
“He came to the sideline where he was hurt,” Reed said.
Behind the sideline, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombi oxygen before picking it up on the stretch for further examination.
A Tennessee State Tigers team official told Chris Harris of WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombi had operated on at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury." The Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombi, a second student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He performed five ball interceptions on Sunday before being out of the game. Thus, he has 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers will pay more state duty in case of purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more duties in case of purchase of real estate in the UK. According to the new Tory plans, additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless
This event neutralizes all Corbyn attempts to attract young voters
The highest state duty will be charged from those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional ?120 million a year to help homeless people
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in the UK will pay more duties. Additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless.
This move can be regarded as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing aimed at high-paying workers.
The increase in duties will apply to individuals and legal entities who do not pay taxes in the UK. The government will direct additional funds to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open air.
An additional duty that accompanies the increase in two years of antiquity for the second housing and real estate intended for lease can be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise an additional ?120 million per year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate, which is being built in London, falls into the ownership of foreign citizens. This leads to an increase in prices and complicates the task for those who only dream of their own housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country, in particular, in the capital, are empty, since a large number of foreign buyers most of the time live outside the country.
The new action plan came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower state duty to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying up land without further using it. He urged Theresa May to abandon quotas for affordable real estate to correct the "disgusting position in the housing market" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a number of important real estate reforms, including rent control and the inability to issue without good grounds.
He also proposes to expand the powers of local councils in the field of building new housing.
Theresa May said: “Last year I promised that I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream — for every new generation of life should be better.
This requires changes in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own housing has become unattainable. The problem of living in the open sky still remains very painful."
Jack Ross: “I want to be the head coach of Scotland”
Head coach of Sunderland FC Jack Ross claims that he “over everything he wants” ever to lead Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has taken to rebuild the club from the northeast of the country, which now ranks third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning last season to the Scottish Premier League.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to Scotland’s second team, but it’s over,” Ross said during the Sportsound program on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of Scotland at Hampden Park Stadium. It always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful as the club’s head coach.”
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland FC, particularly Dick Lawyer, David Mois, Sam Ellardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach of FC Alloa Atletik claims that he did not feel worried about moving to a large club following such authoritative names, having previously rejected proposals from FC Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
“At the current stage, I will consider that I have succeeded if the club returns to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and material and technical support, this club, no doubt, corresponds to the level of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not going to be an easy task, but I’m unlikely to consider another result successful for myself.”
Ross has only been building a coaching career for three years. Prior to that, he worked as a second coach at the Drumbarton FC FC, and also spent 15 months at the coaching staff of FC Harts.
He then helped Hello recover after FC got to the third division, and the following season with St. Mirren went from the departure stage to winning the first division winners title.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at FC Clyde, Hartlpool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“I was at a crossroads,” he recalls, speaking of the transition to Alloa FC.
“I really believed that coaching was more suited to me than playing.
It sounds strange because I was successful, earned well on it and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many difficulties that you have to overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but as head coach, I feel in my place.
I've always been interested in coaching work. I've never felt so comfortable for my entire adult life since I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 on Sunday is the perfect time for a cup of beer
Summer heat helped increase the revenue of British pubs, which are not going through the best times, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
According to calculations, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the author of the CGA, a business development consulting organization, said: “Thanks to solar weather and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup, July passed according to the same scheme as the previous month, when pub revenue grew by 2.8%. And from restaurants things went even worse.
The final fall of 1.8% in July increased.
Pubs and bars focused on the supply of drinks, so far have the best indicators - the growth of their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
The pubs that serve food have also been affected by heat, but not as much as restaurants.
Visitors are only interested in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% per month. At the same time, food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM’s licensing and hotel business department, said: “We have seen similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sports events remain the main factors affecting sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to lose profits. The annual fall in sales by 4.8% is of particular concern against the background of the need to reduce costs.
The long hot summer has not come at the best time for food establishments. We will see if the temperature we observed in August can give them such a necessary rest."
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new institutions, in July amounted to 2.7%, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of new brands.
Coffee Peach Tracker’s industry sales indicator in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups, the total turnover of which exceeds ? 9 billion. This is a generally accepted industry standard.
One in five children has a social network account hidden from their parents
As the results of the study showed, one in five children, sometimes under the age of 11 years, has a social media account hidden from parents and teachers
A study covering 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fictitious pages on Instagram
This news has increased concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a “main account” that parents show
One in five children, sometimes under the age of 11 years, creates an account on social networks that hides from adults.
A study covering 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram, a social network for photo sharing.
This news has increased concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean “main” account that shows parents, as well as one or more private.
A mother who accidentally came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw there a call to "qualt me."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that the additional account is secret.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC association, said: “We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel the desire to create an online space where parents and teachers will not be able to find them.”
Eilid Doyle will be the “representative of athletes’ interests” on Scottish Athletics
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as an independent director during annual general meetings of board members.
Doyle is Scotland's most titled athlete. Council chairman Jen Beatty called this step a great opportunity for those leading the sports movement to take advantage of its extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Ailid enjoys great respect among athletes in Scotland, the UK and the world. We are convinced that by attracting it to the board, athletic sports in Scotland will benefit greatly,” Beatty assured.
Doyle noted: "I will be inspired to act as an athlete's interest representative. I hope I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland."
An American, a four-time Olympic champion who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and now a sports viewer for the BBC, has lost the opportunity to walk through a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I could recover and how much.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I managed to recover completely. I learned to walk again and today I perform dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your support!”
In the advertising of the milk sucker women compared with cows - the opinions of Internet users were divided
The manufacturer of milk suckers has faced an ambiguous reaction of Internet users to advertising, in which young mothers are compared to active cows.
To commemorate the release of the product, called "the world's first quiet native milk sucker", consumer goods technology company Elvie has released an advertisement in the style of humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom provided to mothers with a new sucker.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cow under a song containing the following words: "Yes, I feed myself, but I have no tail" and "As you can see yourself, it is not a wash, but my breasts."
The choir then sings: "Suck off, suck the kids to feed. Suck, suck, so as not to waste milk."
However, the commercial published on the company’s Facebook page caused a heated discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of Internet users turned out to be ambiguous. Many noted that the advertising underestimated the "horrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
“It’s not a very smart solution to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their children are taken from them a few days after birth,” wrote one of the users.
Elvie milk absorber can be easily hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here’s another comment: “It’s clear that it’s traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not attract them to advertise a milk sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
Someone added, “This advertisement is far from reality.”
Other users defended the commercial. One of the women video turned out to be "very fun".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would definitely have acquired such a thing if I was still breastfeeding.
When I sucked milk, I felt like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I didn’t look for hidden content in it.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Here’s another comment: “Funny advertising focused on moms who suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie suction device works completely quietly, has no wires or tubes and easily hides in a feeding bra. Due to this, women can move freely, keep children and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on this situation: “The Elvie sucker is so revolutionary that he demanded a bright and provocative presentation.
Having drawn a parallel between women who grow milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way demonstrating an incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker will bring.
The Elvie sucker is not the first time in news headlines.
As part of the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product while showing clothes from fashion designer Martha Yakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because tough rhetoric and policy by the Trump administration have complicated the process of placing children from caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, immigrants themselves were the guardians without documents. Now they are afraid to jeopardize their own opportunity to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be transferred to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Control, testified to Congress that Bureau staff had arrested dozens of people applying for unaccompanied minors.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal past.
"About 80% of people who are caregivers or members of their households are in the country illegally. Many of them are foreigners who committed an offence.
So we continue to pursue these people,” said Mr. Albens.
According to asylum workers to consider children’s cases faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days later, as it was before.
Many of them will be able to use video conferencing, rather than coming to court in person to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who are not entitled to asylum by the court decision will be quickly deported.
According to asylum workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression. This can cause outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Human rights activists argue that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving children to the tent town and not giving enough time for them to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk increasing the injury that many of them have already suffered.
Syria orders U.S., France and Turkey to immediately withdraw troops
In addition, speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been in war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so "the attitude to them will be appropriate."
“They must go immediately and not put the conditions,” he said at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is actually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria. They mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In the war-torn war, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
As for refugees, Mualem assured that the country has created proper conditions for their return. He also accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unreasonable fears" because of which refugees do not dare to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help people come back,” he said.
"We are seeing an effort to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not provide assistance to Syria in restoring the country until a political agreement has been concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive by Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province of three million people living.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal has "clear terms" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-related al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee in the near future, which will include government and opposition representatives to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem put forward conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying his work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
Trump’s logic could be re-elected in 2020, if many liberal viewers probably hope, he will not be able to take office early after the scandal and impeachment.
No doubt it would be the "most dramatic conclusion of the presidency of all time"!
At the moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the rating with 3.5 million viewers in the evening, when the main news is discussed.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s beyond our understanding,” said Neil Ber, executive producer of the drama The Last Candidate on ABC on the Secretary of State, who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Schowell, an experienced humor writer and author of Only Funny Moments: As well as a few harsh truths about penetration into the Hollywood Men's Club, offers a different theory.
She recalled a Boston taxi trip before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he'll make me laugh," he said. This story told me Mrs. Scowell.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of Rowe's case against Wade, the possibility of uniting immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Departure is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you can’t say that you’re just trying to stay informed citizens when you watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “well-informed” sources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort’s jacket of ostrich skin for $15,000 (“clothes for the arrogant” — so wrote about it in The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions.
For me, Super Mario will never be the same again.
“The sense of the reality show is partly due to the fact that you are fed something new every evening,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the TV program “Stars of Lombard”, about rotations in the actor’s composition and daily story twists in the show “Trump” (conflict with NFL, support for Kim Jong-un).
If you afford to miss at least one episode, you can get behind hopelessly.
When I managed to meet Mr. Fleis at his home on the north coast of Kauai Island this week, there was warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he sat at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not break away from the TV - not when Brett Cavano stood before the Senate Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the line.
“I remember how we created all those crazy shows at one time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Mr. Flease.
"I took it as a joke, but it seems they were right."

External infusions in the toughest midterm elections to Congress
It is not surprising that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania there are additional cash infusions, because through the revision of the boundaries of constituencies, two current congressmen compete for one chair.
In the fight for this suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose borders were recently changed, comes a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won another district in an additional election last spring.
Lamb opposes another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfs, which now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The cards were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were outlined in favor of Republicans contrary to the constitution.
The election race in the new 17th district sparked a tough confrontation between the financial units of major parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee on Congress Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's surname became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning with minimal advantage in the 18th district during an additional congressional election in March that enjoyed wide public attention.
This place belonged to Republicans for over a decade. President Donald Trump won in this district with a 20-point advantage.
Political experts gave a slight advantage to Democrats.
The United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed their mind
Diplomats recalled the weak resistance from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela. Previously, Trump also had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the staff hired by the Trump Organization from there.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to not recognize Taiwan,” said Department spokesman Gezer Neuert earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support for social and economic development.
The proposed fines that provided for cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rate.
According to the results of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed the conference at a high level on security and economic prosperity. A similar event was held last year, and it was regarded as a step forward in efforts aimed at keeping the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration representatives made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador stopped at this consideration.
Vice President Mike Pence now plans to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign that the administration considers the event very important.
Three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, as there were no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on details of internal discussions reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom were diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information provided by them was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn history
The next trouble could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, strong confirmation of why can be found in the public information now available.
Mueller is reportedly testing a possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in Congress goes into other hands, Trump will have to report to congressmen, as well as to voters and, ultimately, fellow party members.
There is a lot of “if” in this case, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable, as is his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to arrange a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West began to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is defined by such turning points, and the unrestrained movement of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans are now waiting for several such turning moments.
What will we do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person on whom Mr Mueller’s fate depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble while this newspaper had information that last year he offered to secretly record conversations with the president and shared considerations on Trump’s inconsistency with the position.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
“How will we react if the investigation into the case against Brett Kavanano, which recently started by the FBI, turns out to be not careful or honest enough or if Kavano’s candidacy for a position in the Supreme Court is approved despite convincing allegations of sexual harassment and giving false evidence?
And above all, will we vote for those members of Congress in the medium term who can hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, evil times will come for democracy.
But I believe we won't let go, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With such a legacy, can I not look optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Vienna Rapid
FC Rangers hosts Rapid (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive draw in Spain in the game with Villarreal earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with good chances to leave the G Europa League group.
Due to knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with Villarreal, which ended with a score of 2:2. However, he believes that FC Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve more.
“This was a good result for us, because Villarrreal is a strong team,” the 31-year-old player said.
“We went to the game with the hope of getting something and got one point.
Perhaps at the end of the match we could go ahead, but in general, a draw can probably be considered a fair result.
In the first half, the enemy was better, but after the break we corrected the situation in our favor.
On Thursday, another important confrontation in the Europa League will take place.
I hope we can get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future opponents showed a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of fans. I am sure that we will be able to give a fight and get a positive result.
Last year, of course, was difficult, ranging from my injuries to changes in the club itself. But now the situation has normalized.
We have a great warehouse, and all the guys are satisfied. Training is going well.
I hope we can go on, leave behind last season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize self-care, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they spoke to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents talked about it with children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they are in no hurry to have a conversation on this topic,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
That's where you need to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care if you do not inform your wishes to relatives in advance.
Consult your counselor and family to determine where and how to get care, as this choice can be an important factor when determining the cost.
Engage a financial advisor: he can advise a way to cover the relevant costs.
Long-term care funding sources include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self-security at your own expense (provided you have money).
Prepare legal documents carefully: this will allow you to avoid legal burden in advance.
Prepare a power of attorney for your representative who will control your medical care and make sure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, we advise you to issue a power of attorney for the disposal of cash.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in case of your incapacity.
Don’t forget about minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs emergency medical care, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Write down such information to be ready.
"It's not just about finance. It is important who the doctors are, - says Martin, -
What medications can be taken and
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare such a plan.”
In Ilfrakum, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle
The man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle when he returned home from a party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracum, Devon when he was shot in his chest, stomach and hand.
Officers described the shooting that took place at 02:30 British summer time as "random".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds do not pose a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, government officials said, but the number of victims could increase.
Due to the failure of the means of communication, officials dealing with humanitarian assistance issues cannot obtain any information from Dongal's regency, an area north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicenter of a 7.5-point magnitude earthquake.
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some basic facts about the city of Palu located on Sulawesi Island and Dongala Regency.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people according to data for 2017.
When the earthquake that caused the tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
According to data for 2017 in the regency, the administrative region located in the lower part of the province, there are approximately 299,200 people.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moravial, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, Palu and Dongala have been affected by the tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal. Nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, located in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom are in Aceg province.
2005: In late March in early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook south Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province, recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 points.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake shook one of the islands of Mentawai located near Sumatra and caused a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which killed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit Podijay's regency in Aceg province, causing destruction and panic due to the fact that people have not yet managed to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died under the wreckage of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island immediately.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Peilin's track, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of attack.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Peilin of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged him from preventing reports of violence and resisted during his arrest.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her phone away.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody in the detention center Matanuska-Susitna with the right to make a pledge of $ 500.
He came to court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when asked if he pleaded guilty, the network said.
Peilina is accused of three Class A misconduct, which provides for an arrest of up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also accused of class B misconduct, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time there have been criminal charges against Peilin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Peilin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as that he had prevented reports of domestic violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he had hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son's brutal behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused a tsunami: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications and power supply networks have come out of line, and the number of victims may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of Sulawesi Island, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
The video distributed on social networks shows the moment when the element hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on the beach of Palu when the tsunami hit ashore.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspect in New York attack
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty of Saifullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov driving a rented at Home Depot pickup truck along the highway in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began shooting down cyclists and pedestrians that happened to him on the way.
According to reports of intent to achieve executions filed in the Southern District of New York to justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight persons and "deliberately" caused serious bodily harm.
According to court materials, each of these counts provides for the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Jury Court charged Saipov on 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, which federal accusers are put forward in cases related to organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to the accusers who described the crime committed by Saipov as "horrible, cruel and malicious", this attack is the result of "careful planning and pre-thought-out intent."
The victims that Saifulla Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, harmed or killed were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Ehrich, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendosa and Alejan Damian Pagnucco, as described in the report.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York City last violated a criminal case that is punishable by the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty for a federal case was last led to execution in New York in 1953. The couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court materials, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate remorse in the days and months after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he did not regret what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by the attack of ISIS videos he was watching on his phone.
Police say he also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital ward.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge on 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by such a decision by the prosecutor's office.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting pleas and awarding life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only increase the psychological trauma of all victims caused by these events,” Patton said.
The Side of Saipov’s defense has previously also asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP believes FARAJLA needs to be appointed responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Conservative Party convention, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army."
Former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, as one of the MPs Theresa May proposed his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party MP Peter Bown said on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "already worked out" if Mr. Farage was Brexit secretary.
Attention to the problems May faced, trying to reconcile his deeply divided ranks, further attracted that Conservative Party MPs who oppose the exit joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to implement the Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
Allies insist that it will not abandon attempts to negotiate with Brussels despite a negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it offers and the "chaos".
At a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihal, Mr. Bown said he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He invited Mr. Faraju to get out of the shadows and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible for it, we would have already left,” he said.
Parliament MP Wellingborough added, "I'll support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to obey.
We want to pass our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and do not want to come out is absolutely untrue."
Conservative Party member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters, "I'm just saying, 'Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers’ plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists who actually walk the streets and are fighting for voters’ votes.
Please reject Chequers and start listening.”
In an address to Theresa May, she added: "Prime Ministers retain their position when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians should "feel pressure" if they are going to abandon the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it is a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to say they won’t get away.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political elite, who plans to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel pressure.
We will mobilize the people’s army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never calm down until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved banners of “Conservators against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives because after the conference opened due to their party program, security problems arose.
“These are people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland,” he said.
"It's a full farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “seriously think” about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously think about running for president after the November election."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during a general meeting in West Massachusetts, a Democratic Party representative from Massachusetts spoke about its future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, runs in November for a second term against Republican Party member Jeff Deal, who co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is considered as the main candidate that can compete with Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a general meeting since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren replied that "it is time for women to go to Washington and set up the work of the government, and for this there must be a woman at its head."
Arrested suspect in the murder of firearms basketball player "LSJ Tigers" Sims
Police at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of firearms from firearms basketball player Wade Sims was arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dieton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. East time.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting asking to help recognize the person on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the campus of the University of Southern on Friday morning.
“Weid Sims was injured in the head and died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was established that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, had weapons with him and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Button County Police Department.
Sims, whose height was 6 feet and 6 inches and who played in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 stars last season and spent 17.4 minutes on the field on average, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton cut back in the fight for the world title after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Waltteri Bottas left behind Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes' team decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well with pole positions and almost bypassed Hamilton, who tried to hold his position in the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammates.
Vettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which had to solve everything.
The Mercedes team pilot drove another circle and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton broke out into the leader after a certain wheel maneuver to the wheel, resulting in the Ferrari driver reluctantly leaving interior space due to the risk that it would be squeezed, after he managed to break forward in the third turn as a result of a double maneuver.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the grid and remained in seventh until the end of the first round.
Potiv he led most of the race because he did not change the tires to quickly come to the finish line and shift Kimi Raikkonen from fourth place.
He eventually stopped at the pit stop on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the pace by the last eight, making Raikkonen fourth place.
“It’s a difficult day because Valtteri was teaching at the full weekend and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to drive.
The team has done exceptional work to take first and second place,” Hamilton said.
Body language was not impressive.
At a Saturday rally, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Finestein for her firm stance that she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano of sexual violence.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which he said demonstrated human "pair, videlity, and lying."
“The only thing that could happen and all the wonderful thing that has been happening in the last few days in the Senate is anger, you see evil people who show meanness, videlity and lying,” he said.
“You look at publications and disclosed information, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finestein, have you disclosed the information?
Remember her answer... Have you disclosed the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose."
Wait a minute.
We have disclosed?... No, we didn’t disclose,” he added, copying the senator’s behavior.
In July, Finestein received a letter detailing the charges brought against Cavanaugh, and in early September his contents were disclosed, but Finestein denied that the leak of information had occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t disclose the information received from it,” Finestein said in a statement.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promise."
However, her objection did not seem to like the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you, the language of her body was not impressive at all.
She may not have done it, but I haven’t seen anyone stay worse yet.”
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate who three women have been accused of sexual violence, the president suggested that Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power in any necessary means.
You see meanness, anger, they don’t care who to offend, who needs to step over to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" - "Belfast Jayants", 5:3
Jayants player Patrick Duier threw two goals in a match against Dundy
Dandy Stars was rehabilitated for Friday defeat in the elite league from Belfast Jayants, winning a 5:3 match-response on Saturday.
The Jayants received an early advantage in two pucks thanks to the throws of Patrick Duier and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney equalized the score in the home match, and then Duier again took the Giants forward.
Dani player Franois Bushar equalized the score, and two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third in the elite league season defeat of the team Adam Kief, which won a volitional victory over Dundy 2-1 evening on Friday in Belfast.
This is the fourth meeting of the teams in the season. The three previous matches were won by the Jayants team.
The first puck Duyer threw in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall's transmission, and four minutes later, Boville, who received a puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period in the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the field hosts to the game, and in the sixteenth minute (15:16) Cooney, receiving a puck from Matt Markwardt, equalized the score.
Dwayer secured the Jaiants' advantage over the first break, throwing his second puck at the end of the first period.
The field hosts regrouped, and Bushar in the twenty-eighth minute (27:37) leveled the score again by throwing the puck when his team was numerically superior.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corkoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he first brought Dani forward and secured his team's victory in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Jayants team, which has already lost four of the last five games, will play a away match against Milton-Kines.
Air traffic controller killed so hundreds of people on plane could avoid earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped take off the plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people died and were missing after a severe tsunami earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong tremors continue to shake the area, many people were under rubble in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the dispatching tower, which was shaking heavily, at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrey Airport in Palu.
He remained on the spot to make sure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, had safely risen into the air.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian aeronautical service provider spokesman Johannes Sirit said the decision could save hundreds of lives, according to the Australian agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which is to deliver him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sorry to hear about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands as the country's disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims can increase, as many bodies are still under debris, and many of them cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves, whose height reached six meters, devastated the city of Palu, in which mass graves will be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver assistance and food.
Reese Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Ian Gelfand, chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?” CNN said.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on Lombok Island, killing more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the plane crash in the lagoon, one man disappeared
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one person has disappeared, although it has previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said that as of Saturday, one passenger cannot be found.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and for this purpose cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, for example, about his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and the team after the plane fell on the water when it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew a runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low above the ground.
“That’s very good,” Janes said.
Janes said he and others managed to go to emergency exits on a sinking plane while on a belt in the water.
He said that the stewardesses panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to upgrade the dock also helped in the rescue operation by delivering people ashore using an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in plane crashes related to PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used records from a mobile phone to replicate the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett, according to The Clarion Ledger, said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was from Chambers that evening when she died, contrary to his previous claims.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pickup that night, Sanford said he "lies because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Telephone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowett said that some time after Chambers Tellis' death, deleted text messages, calls and contact information from Chambers from his phone.
“He’s erased her from his life,” Gale said.
The defense must make its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be passed on to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
A trio of hip hop artists wants to challenge a negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that hip hop has changed its nature - has departed political ideas and the struggle to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the origins and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently witnessed a revival of this direction in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit against a couple for his dismissal, receiving a “racist” message
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit against a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was "another black".
The couple denies that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit with the "excession".
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who had come on her first working day in 2016, was black.
“NO, exactly ONE Darkness,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Miss Morris twice.
As reported by the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt “uncomfortable” and fired Miss Morris. She said that their previous nanny, who was African-American, did her job badly and that instead she expects a nanny from the Philippines.
Miss Morris paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is applying for a couple to court, hoping to receive a refund for a fee that she would receive for six months of work with the marriage, which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract. She was to be paid $350 a day.
“I want to show them that they don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to accusations that they were racist, the couple said Morris's release was a smart decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
“My wife didn’t mean what she had sent.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children with a person you were treated rudely, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your baby?
NAWARD."
Comparing the lawsuit to "excession", Plasco said his wife gave birth to a child only two months ago and "has not yet recovered."
"Would you take revenge on someone after that?
This is a bad act,” added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As the new letter says, Padington publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea with a bear that was able to speak
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, born almost immediately after the book agreed to print, said of the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it’s funny because we know about the huge success that the story about Padington has gained.”
Speaking that her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before a small toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, was optimistic about the fact that his work was rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release at the same time felt "joy and sadness", because his father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
“He was a rather modest man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although these are not theirs, not our victories.
I think he looked at Padington's success that way.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to 2 Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
“Over regularly called, said everything was really bad that she shouldn’t have done it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
“And then Nad called me and said she would die within the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped acting and leaving the body.
She died some time before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait for knowing what was happening at this time.
I couldn't grieve, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold myself in my hands.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, who was burning due to the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, paying no attention to the harsh tests she had to endure.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I put my head down and couldn’t hold back tears.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to deeply sympathize with Nadia.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women who have suffered grief leave postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries leave postcards with phone numbers on Welsh Bridge, which people can seek support, as well as messages that would pray for them.
Miss Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same thing as me every day,” she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Ice, said her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found his brother's body after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid that it will have consequences."
Miss Davis created postcards "so people know there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t be locked in yourself, you have to talk.”
Miss Humphries, who was friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, with whom she lived 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed that he was depressed or so,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that it had changed.”
And on Christmas Day, he finally became discouraged. When the children opened their gifts, he did not look them in the eye or something."
She said his death was a huge injury to them, but they must survive it: "It's a destructive
It should be family.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Bretta Kavano's future hangs in the hair: FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we asked for — limited in the time and nature of the investigation — we might have reached some agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday that he was afraid that the committee was “dissolved” against the background of the hopeless loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is related to time.
Intermediate elections will be held in just five weeks, November 6. If Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to hold their own person through the election of their own person in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush called senators to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and thanks to which he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit, will be held a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanano will be able to receive at least 50 votes at a Senate meeting, which would enable Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the post of Supreme Court judge.
During Kim’s reign, the number of North Korean defectors “short”
After Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined, the South Korean legislator said.
Park Pyon Seg, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the Republic of South Korea, said last year the number of defectors was 1127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were increased border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers carrying illegals now demand more money for it.
Pyongyang refrained from public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed denuclearization issues, negotiations on which have come to a dead end.
This happened after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho accused the United States of lack of progress since then.
“With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be confident in the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no talk of unilateral disarmament,” Ri Jon-Ho said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not suitable for working in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the position of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court by temperament.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I thought all the time that if a woman ever acted in this way, she would be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavano’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanano emotionally denied allegations of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanano behaved very emotionally, sometimes almost screaming and repulsed, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavano's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as this showed his prejudice against Democrats.
“I think these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and Democrats, he will withdraw his own candidacy,” she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to declare Kavanano impeachment if his guilt was confirmed, and whether Democrats would receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not just for working in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about possible Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Medical Care Act or the Row v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of approval in office, Kavanano bypassed the question of whether he would cancel some Supreme Court decisions.
“Now is not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, biased person and we will say how wonderful it is,” Pelosi said.
Women must possess this weapon.
These are just words that contained the rage accumulated for months and years, and it could not pronounce them without tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, are you?"
She continued: “One woman who worked as an executive director somewhere and helped me a lot said she was crying when she was angry, but she had her own technique. When she was angry and started crying, she told the interlocutor: “You might think I’m sad and because of that I cry.
I am evil."
And then she just continued.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered an acceptable output of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my clearest memories of my first job in the office, where men worked mostly, was the situation when I was crying from indescribable anger, and the older woman - an inhospitable manager, whom I was always a little afraid - grabbed me by the collar and pulled me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They will think you are sad and happy to have reached you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in extramarital communication aboard a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, a deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with laughter 30 years later.
“seven other candidates have already participated in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed.”
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in the fundraising, so she made a promise that she would not participate in the race unless she took $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret supporting the men of $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll be given a discount?” she was surprised.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was gripped by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system, which greatly complicated the collection of money and forced to focus not as much as voters as members of the chamber of deputies, as well as anger on sexism. She was ready to cry.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Miss Schroeder’s reaction of the press.
You would think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
“Did she cry?”
How the trade war between the US and China could bring benefits to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and although far from its completion, in the long run, the split between the countries could benefit Beijing.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest situation has escalated this week due to new tariffs on goods worth $ 200 billion ($150 billion), which actually taxes half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing paid off the same coin each time, recently imposing duties of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed to taking similar US measures, and the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to miss the opportunity to keep this promise in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat means agreeing to the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, as experts believe, if Beijing takes advantage of the situation correctly, pressure in the trade war with the United States could bring China an advantage in the long run, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
“A rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic fall in any country. And this actually poses a greater threat than observers have previously admitted,” said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is 'ready' to return refugees
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and seek help in restoring a country devastated by war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore terrorist-torn areas so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave due to terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that influenced their daily lives and limited their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian government would gladly accept assistance in restoring the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they will not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the riot.
Europe consolidates victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 when it won the US team with a total of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup tournament here since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who struggled hard for most of the tournament, broke his first long-range blow on the 16th hole of steam-3 into the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever taken place 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated with a score of 5:4 from the player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbiern Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who ranks first in the world ranking, lost 2:1 to Jan Poulter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup tournament for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Ryder Cup, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who has won the most in tournaments of all time, bringing 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a hard year.
Thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to be so happy to return the cup.
It is the merit of the team and I am happy to be able to help,” Garcia said, without holding back his emotions after winning Europe.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Rem, who on Sunday defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2-1 single game.
“I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Ram said.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record for the Ryder Cup tournament 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been trying to reach the queen zone throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-end golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said of his team after a disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we did not dominate Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the Association of Professional Golf Players and the Ryder Cup tournament committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You can't help but praise them.
We lost.”
