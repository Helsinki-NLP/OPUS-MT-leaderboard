I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bicycle?
Speak briefly.
Tom is smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do it.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, right?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time online.
You're charming.
Tom said he would complain.
Let's go to meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't digest that.
Tom is hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's going in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We can talk.
The computer can count very quickly.
You don't need it.
Sorry, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I'm thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Want more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change diapers.
Are people still using webcams?
I wonder if Tom once asked Mary why she quit school.
This word is borrowed from Greek.
Will I die?
I die, so I want to see them.
Brother is sick.
Don't push.
The car is outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.

We actually went to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than me.
For better or worse, television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He easily answered my question.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom is looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When is she coming?
That's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm very glad I did it yesterday.
Tom still lives next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I speak.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you meet him often?
Tom you'd like it.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You'll stop.
She was waiting for him for hours.
Doctor, sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the year two thousand.
Tom will probably do that.
It should be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mom.
After a short peace, the war broke out again.
Better not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What is the name of this restaurant?
Sorry, could you give me sugar?
Where exactly is Tom planning to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" - "On the chair".
I don't think there will be any problems.
Tom crashed?
You need to cut your hair.
Greens fit you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays football.
How does it all work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, guys.
I fix my shirt.
When is his return?
I rested well.
He is no less good than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I make too many mistakes.
He is not afraid of death.
It would be nice if the day had 28 hours, right?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would like this disaster not to happen.
We don't hope for victory.
I don't have the money.
I'm not teaching here anymore.
We didn't find a guy.
Take the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Tom will soon learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They can fish.
Tom left the room.
I still do this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He won his first prize.

I don't have books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My work is very boring.
He, as it were, man-robot.
Answer the question!
You need you in the hospital.
I can't find lifts.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do that.
He has green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I have no friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope for that.
Sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom has never been to Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, there broadcast the Grand Prix.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind you.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English is not my native language.
I had no friends in Australia.
Do you think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What is the name of this girl?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So you shouldn't do it again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom stared at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children until she is not there.
I'm cooking now.
Have you seen Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He is often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom shaved his head?
Why did Tom do that?
I know this girl's father.

I didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you start to get bored?

Why are people still smoking?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I am a student and he is not.
I tried to do just that.
I wrote a book.
Silence, please.
I bought my son new sleds.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister Sakiko. She was born the same year as me, and now she is preparing for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you completed your homework?
Monday will probably be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I disagree with him.
Maybe you should help Tom paint the fence.
Why do people behave like big monkeys, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Mudak.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I applied for a visa.
It's snowing today.
She continued to work.

What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how it is done.
Don't you meet anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What is the date today?
Where's Dad?
Lock the door.
I'm not going to talk to Tom in French.
The apple tree does not fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
My uncle is your father’s brother or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was in jeans.
See you after the show.
I'd like to ask a question.
This is my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined Satan’s Church.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom has no money.
Isn't you surprised to see me here?
I'm leaning.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are these?
You want to do that, eh?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks dogs twice a day.
Let me look at Tom's book.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honshu and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn’t have much money in the bank.
I think we need to leave now.
We didn't do that.
Do you think Tom is crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I won't help you.
Disturbed.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can match him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you understand that?
She committed suicide.
We have equipped our office with computers.
You have to pay early.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Don't you plan to stay?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom is drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I am still teaching French.
Tom will do it immediately.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three times more books than I do.
You missed a lot.
I wear boots.
You can count on me.
His book became the object of criticism.
It'll be brilliant.
I'm very scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You didn't lose time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom testified to Mary's case.
I thought you left.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can I ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Don't you vote?
You should quit smoking.
I think Tom is cheating.
I know many French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play the violin?
Give me salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's miserable.
It was popular among both students and teachers.
Tears of grief will not help.
Tom plays football and runs.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung the listener.
I'll be back soon.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where is your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do that.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell you why he does it.
He speaks to Esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't do that.
She has good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a ladies' advisor.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I nice?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Vids.
You'll let Tom turn you?
You're a pretty woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Did Tom actually move to Boston?
Tom stretched out Mary beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Kids grow so fast.

I'd like to withdraw the money.
I'll shake Tom's hand.
They'll be okay.
Half of these apples are rotting.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don’t have to worry about tomorrow’s exam.

I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do that.
Tom started throwing.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.

Tom still wants to come.
You don't run away.
I am Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend your vacation?
Did you get a Christmas gift from Tom this year?
I still get a little bored with my home and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have trouble remembering.
Where's Mom?
He fainted three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
You shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom is with me now.
Tom's fine?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
You know the reason?
Check voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom is a little behind the schedule.
Tom is not a hero.
Can you catch a taxi?
You're gonna be late, because you're late.
It'll be difficult.
Does Tom always behave like that?
I like playing golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to speak so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It will work, you will see.
She threw him away.
Tom is safe.
I finally got a driver's license.
I'm not a student.
That was a pity for Mary.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom constantly checks the phone.
How's a wife?
You're completely right.
Tom is not rich, and Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone was late except me.
Let's stop!
This is a book.
I don't plan to shake the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of strange ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your effectiveness.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you teaching?
I regret eating those oysters.
Hello.
Please write your name in pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She completely ignores me.
Tom's going to a party tonight.
I was talking.
She was heading to the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What do you tell them?
How did you know it would happen?
What's there?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, then Esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom is in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a nice garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you just did your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what exactly happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you say because I was joking?
Tom was terribly boring.
Tom said I was pretty.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take out the trash.
Don't you come back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?

It will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed from fear.
Do you like these perfumes?

Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
They are worthless now.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom can win.
Aliens fly and take away our work from us. Earth for earthlings! Deport Martian!
Don't worry.

So still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad, and never returned.
Gather your toys together.
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?

We want to vote.

Why don't you sleep?
Tom really thinks someone is listening?
No need to give up!
Tom, you might say, is nice.
Anyway, I disagree with you.
I had to go early.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.

I don't understand, and I'm not used to understanding. Please explain again.
I share everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about at all is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was cancelled.
My country is densely populated.

You're obviously sick.
You've been to London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I walk slowly.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll get married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I threw the bones.
The book lacked several pages.
I raised the coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks promises.
We must protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sarah don't get along very well.
Each student has their own desk.
I spent twelve hours on the train.
I'll regret it.
I'm not sure Tom is telling the truth.
It's not your business.
Don't go.
Tom has no thirst.
I learned to eat a cow.
I'm full.
Sorry I'm not rich.
The news upset her.
I have a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I never killed anyone.
How is your name pronounced?
She holds flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to that.
The old man is over ninety.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
Are you from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're doing it well, isn't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I take your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom is special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She has red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a policeman?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom told us a lie.
Tom heard Mary married.
I learned a lot.
How much does this umbrella cost?
They both laughed.
What happened?
It can be done.
Tom thinks Mary is exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class was infected with the flu.
Remember when you first heard the Beatles?
Tom was hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
There is no toilet paper.
The word is silver, silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love this T-shirt.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom will probably still be angry.
I'll go to the airport.
Don't take into account her whims.
I am glad that Tom will help us.
Tom will be here from minute to minute.
Glad they are both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I'll see you again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I invited her for a date.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve of what Tom is doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
That's the perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do that.
I don’t expect them to win.
I slept.
How is this my fault?
As for Switzerland, have you been there in the winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's got better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay the loan.
Try to look at it from Tom's perspective.
The window opened.
Nobody thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You will be happy.
Tom looked pretty painful when I last saw him.
Tom's still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from ninth to fifth.
Let me do it with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Grab him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom is such a asshole.
Do you want any more mashed potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a mustache.
I have three questions for you.
I've met Tom a few times.
Do you use a word processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot together.
Please move.
What are you doing this evening?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French fluently, right?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not like that.
Let's go home.
I greeted Tom.
Tom took off the ring.
I'll organize you breakfast.
Tom listened.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are somewhat outdated.
