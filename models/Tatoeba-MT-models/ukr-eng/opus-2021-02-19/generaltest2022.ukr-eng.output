We promised you we'd surprise you when you went to school.
Good morning, I agree to the course.
But please tell me, is there any time before?
Because I don't live in Prague, there can be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no options, I don't mind.
Thank you in advance.
At Gerson, the people were on the rally again, the Russians were not able to drive away.
As the agency explained, those in the west had already held a rally before the war swarm with technicians arrived at the site.

This area is now, like the building, controlled by the armed Russian troops using weapons against the protesters and kidnapping people.

Sascha wasn't in school today, I wrote to the teacher's mail.
Hi, I'm sick, so it's better to take our meeting for the next weekend, I'm sorry.
I know how to cook, but I like to make a recipe.
In Ukraine, there's traditional beans, cooks, others.
I don't have any favorite dishes, I like to try all kinds of food in different countries.
How much do you like eating?
I want to be busy.
There's a train, there's no space.
Sorry, but we're a little late.
Lucia, can I have a helper for the kitchen as well?
It's a great thing for Julia to be able to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
It's very dry and comfortable.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there's going to be a beer job for Nazara and when he has to come to make an appointment.
If Nazar works with 5:30, he can use any train:
Maripol, the heart of war, stop fighting, we're going to have weak positions.
President Vladimir Greenski believes that fighting east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Maripol, will determine the course of war – and if the ZSS are defeated there, Russians can leave negotiations and reoccupy decoupled areas.
The direct language is "Maripol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have better positions.
They're the people who've pulled a lot of enemy away.
The stronger our position in Mariupolis, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the area of OOS, and if they are more robust, the table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in a dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a situation that's going to be weak in all of these directions, we can wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia would take all of these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we're buying right now.
They can go to that too.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and maybe not even interesting to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we're going to make this happen.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory..."
Greenmen also said it's difficult to negotiate after the tortures of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for diplomatic solutions if we have them."
The direct language is, "People will take peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
In our terms, the independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something, and I don't think it will satisfy any peace at all.
But if we are not emotionally speaking, war must end in peace, or millions of victims will end.
And even where there's a million victims, it's all about the end of the war.
Yeah, we have to fight, but for life's sake.
You can't fight for the dust, when there's nothing left, there's no people."
Good morning, do you have any more free seats for the grown-up Czech course from 7:00 on Tuesday?

Dominika, who's making a purchase of the waste materials?

Because of the change in the esthesis in Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality.
It's a analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, of state research.
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for analysis of the post-modiderist context as such, where metaphor plays the role of axilogic criteria

Anyway, we go to work and waste.
On Monday, we're going to be leading, and we're going to decide how and when we're going to be in ourselves.
It's good because I've already begun to drink that I've misunderstood something and I'm not there.
I think it's the right decision, it's better to give less and be able to give quality help to these people than many people do.

According to Ukrinform, this is the main Board of Defense Intelligence in Ukraine, reporting on Facebook.

Tomorrow's probably gonna be a bad time on the road.
I thank everyone for his experience, even if he is painful.
I think I've learned from every situation for myself so that I don't make any mistakes.
The directives are rendered in the form of numbered written additions, which are part of this Regulation.

This depends on religion.
Whether there's a Greek-Catholic or a Catholic.

We promised you we'd surprise you when you went to school.
It's great, I've got money for two months of rental, Olomoska district doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of beastly abuse from civilians north of Kiev.
Photos of shot and shot people confused the whole civilized world.
Tens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century.
I was not surprised at all, but what I was waiting for was exactly what I was feeling sad.
I took children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then, baby girls and babies, and only after that did they come back to work in the capital.
Since 2014, there has been no doubt that in the case of the occupation of Kiev, my family will not be able to survive.
Because it's been and I'm left with absolute confidence that the essence of the rotten Comno-KBistan regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist; it is built on terror.
In 1937 one of my great - grandfathers was shot in a Gitomir prison.
A few years ago, in the Jewish SBU, a copy of the great - grandfather shooting was taken: the whole case is over a hundred pages, but the execution sentence is very simple and even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor one-way, never walked in the cogs.
The fact that a number of cows lived on the sidewalks was sufficient to deny thepahar and the feeding of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know where the burial place was.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all except two who agreed to give a false witness.
In the criminal case, there's the name of the knocking of Charius.
Our former Supreme Council speaker comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I'm not surprised if his cousin was a KGB informant.
The apple of the apple tree, it is known, is falling...
There was an emergency tribe, which led to the execution of peasants, there were ethnic Russians.
As they analyzed the great - grandfather case, they were interested in various information resources.
There are great (without sarcasm) information resources like "The Death barracks," which reminds you of the events of those years.
So in modern times, the NCVDists' descendants have found ways to punish and kill almost everyone who has seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 or 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin's republics and publicly wrote the names of murderers, the system was first discredited and then destroyed.
Like they found children's pornography files on the computer, they put her in jail, and he died in a short time.
The KGB are still killing those who have tried to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Why, then, are you surprised at their action now?
There, the most cold features of human nature are concentrated.
Over a thousand years of Orthodox tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism were established in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then what came out of it was a beastly genetic experiment, cutting off intelligence in a few waves of red terror.
Look at a half- French movie called "The Chexist" in 1992, and that's how it happened.
You've seen my photos in the suit.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from cough?
Sorry. I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids left because Galia can't find them.

When the girls return from school, what do they do?
We've come to the place where we were settled from center to party, conditions good.
But there's a lot of room but there's a lot of men living around like drinking alcohol and smoking indoors, loud music that's the minimum thing that's bad, the smell of drunk men, and we're having kids... it's scary to go to bed if you're honest.
Please help with the housing, I'll give you the money.
But where it's safe and not smoked.
The smell of the cigarette in the room is like this, it's just a smoke in here.
I'd like to ask you very much, one of them standing barely on his feet, screaming something, something he doesn't like.

And they've also talked about people of the Roman national group that they have a privilege in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and the parents don't understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them in the phone mode.
I need to change the bedcloths, 2 sets.

General Chapecza has a very slow turn.
Everybody's got a chance.
The key is to make love real and mutual.
I don't know how in Europe, but in our country, people are getting married for various reasons, mostly for self-interesting, mercenary purposes.
And I have a problem with that if I don't love people, it won't work.
Yes, we took home and took my aunt away immediately.
She thanked me so much that she cried.
I told her about you and how you help the Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
I said if that could be possible, there might be some old blanket and pillow.
But you don't have to.
I feel sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had many questions about God, why things happened in my life that forced me to give up everything.
I have to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made congregations.
That's true, but we're not in the area yet, and we don't know where everything is, and we're looking for an hour and we're going back on foot.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote me.
Does your dad just know how to speak Russian? Or is he a family member?
I can't let the kids come to Vali and play in the hall.
Okay, so let's risk:
I'm glad I met you, too.
For housing, Vladimir consulted me or read me while they found me or looked for themselves here, the ladies who lived with us that we should go to the subway station there, there's an institution that helps us find a place to live.
I'll break the barrier for a little bit.
I don't know the answer.

I can't call the doctor because I didn't do another food license examination.
But I can't call him because I've run out of money.
I can't get my phone back because I don't understand it in Czech online banking, and the Ukrainian bank card doesn't get replaced.
In addition, waterphone I can't change tariffs so I can have normal phone calls and Internet phone numbers.
I'm going crazy.
The title doesn't sound right, what did you mean?
I’m ashamed to sit out of work.
I just said I was at school in class.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I just felt very nervous.
But it's closer than they're leaving Ukraine to know exactly what they're going to be doing.
It's where all life is now at stake.

According to The European Truth, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in government circles in Ukraine.
According to the report, an appropriate offer was sent to Germany’s Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 hooks, including the educational kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As is also suggested by the hooks on the BRT Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While the tanks are relatively close to the target, Panzerhaubze 2000 can fire more than 20 miles [30 km] away.
According to Ukrainian government circles with a reference to the KMMW proposal, the supply of self-driving hooks will follow a circular circuit.
The Boundesver, in its shortest terms, gives Kiev 100 of his hooks, and the gaps formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new hooks could be placed in 30 months after the contract was signed, which is earlier than the latter part of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.

For me, marriage is a mystery of two people who don't talk to each other about their family or their friends.
Man and woman make their own decisions in their family, especially without their family.

The Dovebees teach in a pot and pour it in with this sauce.
It's about 1.5 hours of nervousness.
How much money do I have in this room?
I've got it all brought in.
Monday 4.
Four, 2022, refugees from war in Ukraine can ask for humanitarian aid in a new place for the Office of Labor in Prague.
Philia at No. 29 is special for feeding and processing applications for help, so there's a translator on the spot.
Lydia's already gone to school, but because of sickness, I'm going to go to Tuesday teacher today.
I'm sitting here holding earphones, listening to music, thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, sweetheart, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I think about it so that we're together, that we're paired.
I'd say there's going to be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what it's like to be home.
I need a food license test, can I do that?
Please tell us to prepare an apartment for five guests tomorrow.
Is fifth place I understand in the room with the TV?
Shall I open up and set up a sofa?
Can we stop here while Mrs. Margaritha finds us a place?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one they've been using, but it's not necessary.
Write the address in Chesha, see the map where it is from us
I don't know how much space there is, so I can't plan anything with furniture this week wants to look at that apartment and then figure out what furniture I need.
I'm sorry that I've been answering for so long, working a day, difficult to adapt.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to be with you at last, to be able to embrace you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell me how you like it.
For a child, there's already a bed and a bath here, and it's been found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me when you could, but it's not the last time you gave  word.
I want to make a rod called a cap.
I'm sick with a cold and cough, but I don't want Jan to come with us so he won't get infected.
Only I'll be a little bit later - about 8 o'clock. Can I?
I don't want a misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried that it's all right!
Because we haven't even talked about this!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I'm not talking about myself!
How do you feel today?
Hey, sorry, I just woke up, didn't sleep well.
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Collea and I had a bad start in translating the test yesterday.
I'm going to ask if Gregory Denissenk or Jonaska can help me with some math.
Maybe I could be something that's good for them, too?
If there's this possibility, I want to stretch out the mathematical terms in terms of the output.
Geometry is hard at all, but we have a Cola working hard to make it work without error.
Thank you for your test assignments
We hope so too.
And so she's very happy to have any gift.
I'd like to have my Czech number turned on the Internet.
Yesterday, at the station’s 402 bus stop, I met Victoria, a Ukrainian.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed that we would be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine who felt my heart of interrelationship.
Philia at No. 29 is special for feeding and processing applications for help
Turns out I ordered a spare card
I'm a simple man.
Don't get her scared that no one's coming.
I didn't go, yes, I did it myself, I can do it, the most important thing is you taught me how to put on the oven.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Holocaust Memorial Center in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers at the Babbain Yara.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He was talking about "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial unity, peaceful and secure Europe.
This is the foundation we have to protect -- it's also part of our responsibility to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear in new clothes today," he said, "then for us Germans, there may be only one answer: never again!
The fight must last."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of peaceful inhabitants, starved the inhabitants of its blocked cities, and allowed them to die of disease.
Russian troops execute mass firing squads of Ukrainians, even visually, it's like firing shots at the Baba River.
For over a month, Germans have seen this in real-time news.
Yes, Germany is implementing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and also weapons that have not been imagined so long ago.
Germany withdraws from the heavy arms supply that Ukraine needs.
But "Never again!" means not just taking a stand against the swastika.
It means fighting every possible weapon against mass murder, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to overcome evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
One for you at night
We agree, have a tour, and write when you're ready to go.
The only people who were sick were Lydia, who didn't have omicron for a new form of cove.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I use this car instead of me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The tickets cost me 2,000Guys in the guide.
Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect.
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociologists showed that 67 percent of Ukrainians were against the introduction to NATO and only 18 percent of those surveyed were speaking for.
After the Hyde Revolution, the flight of Victor Januskowitz, the Crimea Anexia, and the beginning of the Donbasy War, the number of Nato opponents began to fall, and the adherents began to increase.
After the beginning of the full - scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s introduction to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – over 75 percent.
Despite support for Ukraine's introduction to NATO and the help that NATO is doing in the face of war, there are a lot of critics at the expense of Allansia and member countries -- the poor weapons supply, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "gratify" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will have to give up membership in Alyanza because of its pF position if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In the new episode of the Committee of Issues, together with the editor of "European Truth", we are talking about how it has helped Ukraine from the time of the Russian invasion that Nato is to be criticized, and why the Aljans criticize our prospects for membership in Nato as never before in history, and why the security guarantees discussed at the Russian exchanges may become the second Budapestnemoord.
You think it's here.
I have a volt partner that's marked by my claim on the score.
I was offering it because of this mobile app
No visas, no visas, no visas, no visas, and no pesnels.
I'll write you a note!
Come on, Denise's in a good mood today.
Arranged with a boy from Ukraine who had met yesterday to meet at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
For this I don't like, I'm short.
In Ukraine it is reported that the Czech Republic sent tanks T-72 and infantry cars to Ukraine.
I'm going to leave my kids there for 3-4-hours and go home because I can't leave anymore.
I'm taking them with me at six or seven in the morning.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a real feeling for this man, but he did not do very well, so I left him.
After a while he came back again and begged me to forgive him.
I refused.
Then, after some time, he called out that his heart had been operated on.
I asked him just to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I was psychologically supportive for about half a year.
During that time, we had many conversations.
I started having problems in the workplace in parallel.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe we need to look at it differently.
He offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
Thus, God himself has determined our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say I was able to find a place to live, and I'm very glad I have a place to live now, and I have a place to be with a baby.
You ever have to remember me?
( ) Because I was helping to see the children in the family.
Don't be sorry, just write a sentence you didn't understand.
I understand for myself that the translator does not always translate the text correctly
I don't know how to talk to a doctor, should she give me paper?
Those guests must have forgotten, I put them in the closet.
You probably have time to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Can anyone help a woman with XS or S growth of 165. And for her daughters? ( (8, 10, 12) Thank you.
I bought two packs of ice that time and my mom bought two
That's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
Okay, give me a second chance, then I never sleep, I'm still asleep, and I dream of bombs.
God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I understand the price of unskilled jobs and I realize that work like I had at home in Kiev I can't have here and the money I made at home is not going to get either.
But just sitting there and not doing anything I can't do, because then all the bad thoughts in my head are going to be, so I need to be physically occupied.
From 7 a.m. till 7 p.m. at the airport, you can just wait at other times.
Vladimir returned at 4: 00 a.m.
So we took them in.
We slept with Vica in the kitchen, and they were put in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go with them to Airport.
When he's there, write down what's next...
So I can't find a place for myself anymore.
Sir, please, it's the Ukrainian children's business to get into the shithouse.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, just write to me when it's comfortable.
I don't know, I wish I had kids in kindergarten and school.
Is it better for us to switch from time to time?
I'm sorry, I really don't have any missing phone calls from Wednesday.
I offer you work, cleaning bathrooms, washing three windows, dusting.
It's about 3-4 hours, 800 grand once, from 19.04 Tuesday, to 14.00.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're all good.
Can I call you?
Or can you write your wife's contact?
The mess started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy in the medicine store.
I'd like to ask you a suggestion.
We have Anna as the indigenous species of Anja.
She was handed over by her uncle from home
English was made, new partners were added
Write it to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget about me, please--
Is Monday and Wednesday different?
Thank you very much.
You need help to stay in the pool
But that's my opinion.
My uncle, from home, handed her the rollerblading boards, and she tortured them at home, so that's what she's got.
I also got up at 9 o'clock, and now I'm just making breakfast.
I'm very ashamed you're talking to me about your weekend, and I hope I'm not too annoying.
We'd like to report a change in the home and proceed with documents to continue the map
We're now providing medical oxygen to all the hospitals in our country.
I also forgot to tell you I'd have a bite tomorrow.
One mother said she'd burn up jam donuts for kids.
He comes to visit you.
Please tell me, do you have an approximate monthly cleaning schedule, even though for an average understanding of what days?
I don't remember this schedule.)
The Russian army is threatening to strike Kiev with rockets: they say, "Before they did this."
Conanchenkov's direct language is, "We're going to see attempts at diversions and the task of hitting Ukrainian troops on objects in RF.
If such incidents continue, then the RF forces will strike the decision centers, including Kiev, which the Russian army has been able to control before."
The Russians have been hitting Kiev since the first days of a full-scale invasion of the RF troops in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that hit the Ukrainian Pupo system fell on apartment buildings in capitals.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high - rise on the Valeria Lobanovski Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians made television on the Roads near the Babni Sea, killing 5 passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian systems hit the South Railway station with Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Defense Department building.
On March 14 the debris from the rebel missile destroyed the house and the Trolleybus on Kurenovsk in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile struck a residential area on a vine, killing one person, and 19 more were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Redruvile Tribe in a cultivator, resulting in at least 4 deaths.
On April 13, the mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klichko again declared that the inhabitants of the capital, who had evacuated the city, had not yet returned.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians were still able to strike Kiev’s missiles and that there were many mines and unripe ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
On April 12, the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense warned that the Russians were planning a series of terrorist attacks in the area of RF to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against civilians.
On April 1 near Belgorod in Russia, oil was exploded as a result of a Ukrainian helicopter attack.
Early in April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that near the city, it seemed as if the Ukrainian missile had fallen.
It is evident that the elite and Washington, D.C., and in Berlin, he throws into a cold sweat at the very thought that the attic fighters would kill Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But the Greenman isn't talking to them as much as their voters and their societies in general.
In his speeches in Parliament and in front of the thousand - thousand - thousand - thousand - thousand - thousand - year crowd in the largest cities of Europe, a Ukrainian leader does something that none of his predecessors had been able to do.
Greenman's not convincing European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he's proving that to be true for the European people who choose those politicians.
And these talks, this subtle flash of strength, the touch and time of despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While the same Bayden is dogmatic against the closing of the sky, 70 percent of his fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against Ukraine’s quick introduction, the process is already under way.
I understand you, so I don't want to be viewed as swindlers.
The costs you're picking are better off giving people more need.
I can come to you and I can decide where I'm going, and I'm still here to help.
But the air is clean, it's plus !"
It says I've got a brand of "Rose on Two Without Internet," and I asked them to do the Internet.

Do we have any more facilities today, or, as usual, just a stairs from the top down?
So I'm on my way.
But I won't stop loving you, you're all for me.
This is a loan made by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days.
Katha asked for the Internet, can I give her a password?
I thought you and Milan friend didn't shoot a shot.
Great, then I'm a man who's driving me because today he's got a car from the building company where he works.
How happy and thankful we are that our Nick and your grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you so much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war, we can invite you to Ukraine!
One needs to be cut into four.

There's hope... it's not for long.
Now... there's gonna be something...
Mozog refuses to accept...
I don't have anybody anywhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket, everything we did at home.
Many of our leaders have paid no wages on our jobs.
Who do I need?
You can't take a lot of things.

You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning till night, you take your children all over Prague.
I don't know how many times they're asking for candy, but you can't.

We have a choice to stay there and put kids in danger or try to save up here.
She was very pleased with those earrings and the things that the kids gave her when she came to school.

Because I can't understand.
You're doing so much good to us...
We owe you a great deal... thank you!
Yeah, I know it's very good.
I'm going to give you a picture of a lady's card that I'm learning English.
Well, you'll write tomorrow, meet me, or not, maybe your plans will change...

These are small entrepreneurs who in their homes and shops opened volunteer offices.
These are tractors that actually go out to the field under fire because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to go to the rubber stations today to temporarily occupied areas to take help there and take the people away.
They are heroic leaders who drive to war zones, calm and help the refugees in the cars, and help the volunteers to load the humanitarian cars at peace stations.
These were the gas stations that stood on the Jutomir Road in the early days of the war and patiently served the terrified and nervous people.
These waste - disposal utilitys repair water lines and power lines in order to provide for the needs of people.
These are doctors and nurses who, 24 hours a day, rescue people, not complaining about anything, but at a free moment, still volunteer to collect a couple of hot - food kits on the front.
In Ukraine, the juice stops when the little ones are leafy)

Chapter Ofisus President Andrey Jermack reported that Russia is starting a "feetic operation" on the weapons that our allies are sending to us.
Jarmaka's direct speech is, "They understand they're losing the war, they see their backs up, and they're trying to break down the supply in any kind of way.
For example, one of the last fairies is the destruction of the Slovakian S-300s.
This information has already been refuted by Premier Edward Heger.
We know the script of the Russians.
They can run fairies that Ukrainian soldiers seem to be armed with allies, and it masses into the arms of the Russian army.
I want to warn you right now.
For the weapons in the hands of the men of the Force only send the enemy to that world.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine and Moscow has rejected these messages as a ‘prosecution’.
“ Reports of dead, raped, and seriously wounded by Russian troops of peaceful citizens deserve condemnation,” declared New Zealand Prime Minister Jasind Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“The Russian must answer to the world for what they've done,” she added, stating that the government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kisis, called incidents “a violation of international law. ”
It was reported that hundreds of peaceful citizens were shot and thrown into their ferries or abandoned on the streets in the outskirts of Kiev, in the Bush of Russian troops who left this area for weeks after the occupation.
Photographs that supposedly depict bodies of executed civilians bound by hand shocked many and led to calls for an increased sanction against Russia and criminal persecution of the guilty.
The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, announced in a radio interview on April 4, that there are signs that Russian troops committed “war crimes ” in Bush.
“What happened in Bush requires a new sanitation round and very clear measures,” said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed to the Russian export of coal and oil.
Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez claimed that Russian troops could go so far as "genocide" in Bush.
“We will make sure that those who commit these war crimes will not remain innocent,” said Sanchez in Madrid.
On State TV late April 3, Maria Zaharov’s speech on MSD rejected the charge as a ‘ provocation. ’
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO had ordered an image to discredit Russia.
“ In this case, I think the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after these materials came into existence does not raise any doubt about the one who has "challenged this story," said Zechariah.
Russia’s Ministry of Defense used to claim without evidence that Bush’s images were “another ruling of the Kyiv regime ” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the United Nations Security Council to gather on April 4 to discuss what it called “a provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bush.
On April 4, a leading committee of Russia issued a statement in which it declared “experting ” on charges of spreading the country“ falsely known ” information ” to Russian troops in Bush.
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Green, spoke on April 3, accusing the Russian troops of "genocide" in the city, told Creml that they should come to Bush to see what their military had done.
“I want all leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out,” said Greenski in the video, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shootings in the back,” he said.
He claimed that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin and Russian military, had to be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people bound behind their back and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of victims scattered about in the streets of Bushie, cities about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a Ukrainian correspondent for Freedom Radio saw bodies on the streets of a small city as if they were civilians.
At one place alone, correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
Journalists of AP saw at least 21 people in different locations in the Bush.
One group of nine people -- all civilians -- were scattered on land near the place that local residents said they were using Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from a very close range.
In all, Ukrainian authorities claimed that the bodies of at least 410 laymen were found in the region of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything's up, we bought it from the list.
And they said, "They don't have Kiev." As the invaders took the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by horrible things: plunder, rape, murder, torture.
This list has another item about which there is now much less information about taking the local population to enemy territory.
About the middle of March, Russian invaders are evacuating Ukrainians from temporarily occupied communities into their territory and Belarus's territory, which President Lukashenko gave up, in fact, under Russian military troops.
"The Ukrainian truth" found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" was going and if there were ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The hero of this text was exposed to voluntary evacuation beyond Ukraine under psychological pressure and beyond.
Fortunately, they're alive and in contact with their families.
However, in view of the comments made by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So at Melitopoli, the Russians kidnapped the personnel of the second hospital building, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Mirosław, daughter of the dead champion of Ukraine from the voyage of Joseph Zakopinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter, Vali, moved to Gostal a few months before the war.
Alexander actually got a job at the Antonow Airport, which is two miles from the village.
The family settled in the territory of a military town, even though they were civilians.
Like real cereals, Denise and Marina had their anxious suitcases collected in advance, but in the morning of February 24th, they failed to evacuate.
They didn't have their car, and the harbor buses didn't take anyone.
About 12 o'clock on the 24th of February, they saw helicopters with Latin letters V, followed by the first projectiles.
One of them was put in a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for the long three weeks until March 17th, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people hid in their basement.
Not all of them decided.
"On the 6th of February, there were people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian at the entrance.
They say, "Is there a who?"
They searched me, asking me if there were weapons in the basement.
All the men were interrogated as to whether they had served in the army.
The women said, "We've come to defend you on Ramsan Kaderov's orders."
It was a Chechen oMON, not even an army, young guys 25-35.
They said, "We've been helped in the war by the Ukrainians, Sascha Billi (commanded by the Una-Un-UncsO "Vinga," who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-escence War, the UP), and now we've come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say that water, with it, was a big problem.
They ripped the store apart, and they took the goods under the pretext of "all rock-and-stake" and they brought us six dollars.
There's another video on the Internet where kids thank Kaderov for the food.
So that's what they do after the store's robbery, they bring in sausage and they say, "We know it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramsan Ahmothich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You have seven days to give back our phones" -- they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want to fight, Ukrainians support the good ones at all, "Putine is a bastard, too, but we can't do anything, because our families are there."
And mostly they didn't fight, but they were going to steal shops, and they were going to go to war.
They brought one of them, one of them tied up to one leg of a geo-girdic ribbon, and the other got their white tape, and they called it "fed."
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they got beaten on Bush, so they didn't even get killed, so they said, "Do you have an artillery?"
What's more, we had downsized troops -- Chechens between us didn't know, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were theirs or theirs.
They were there by March 13th, after which the Russian HMON came, followed by the Omsante.
They put 30 or 40 units of technology between the buildings, and we always fell into it from the Birractars.
But these came and told us that the OS is gone, but there's "Azov," and they said, "Azow" is now 100 in Ukraine.
I mean, "There's already been Christmas" as far back as March.
One day, a Russian officer or a FSB officer came to our door and said there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio -- there was a lot of Bouchu, Gostelle, and we thought maybe we had a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we gave Chechens our lists, and they promised to contact Ukrainian teams.
But we're told, "You're going to Belarus, and then maybe Rostove."
We say we don't want either there or there.
And they said, "So feel sorry for your kids!"
As it worked, they put us in the basement and started shooting us from under the house, whether we were "Grads," or melomeres.
And then it came back... and neighboring houses just burnt down, part of them collapsed.
Our house had direct entry into the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the borderers and the Red Cross.
Part didn't go, saying it was for traitors in the homeland, saying, "You're going to be shot, sold to the authorities."
We were taken across Chernobyl, on both sides of the road were hot, broken up technology, even though the whiteboards were telling us that the Russian machines were immediately taking them out.
A lot of chaplains, digging techniques, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian space station, we had an impromptu control, many were without papers because they were burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear shots, we hear a rocket shooting, and you can see the lead, it was the lskandar in Kiev.
Although these guys from the Red Cross in Belarus said, "No, they're planes flying, they're turning to the border."
But from aviation, we have education, we understand what that is.
Then we were confined to a bus and taken to the Chaka canal near Gomel.
His boss came, Wenger Vasyl Syropicz, says, "Well, I'm a hool, I'm from Cherniegovah.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko won't be left behind, but those eyes of yours are not going to die.
The poor people are on the run!
We got Lukashenko that good!
That's what he's gonna say, and it's gonna be like."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sewer administration told us, "You're already traitors!"
And the people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least they were called) spread the misinformation that men in Poland were not allowed to travel.
Many believed it and feared to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents, our daughters did not have a passport.
We were to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday, the war broke out.
The Ukrainian consuls didn't help us, but in Minsk, at the station, they told us no one could take anyone to the bus without passports.
I'll tell you what helped us very much by the Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escorts were held.
They didn't keep it there by force.
Our second group of migrants has been told that you can stay here for a maximum week, because Belarus isn't Europe, there's no pay.
We found an inside carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we passed Mozier, about 30 miles [50 km] from the Ukrainian border, we saw the launchings of the ballast missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, it shines beautifully, and then it goes out.
The people who boarded the bus in Moziri said that the Russians were constantly shooting from the policemen.
But I can tell you, the Bilorussians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are fired from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if they called him.
But the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, does not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are peaceful people."
They don't think their polygoons are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we're going through the registration, and we're going to decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, Ukraine's flags are now probably the same as Estonians."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostal with her brother's family -- his wife and two children, the 18s and the 22s.
In the morning of February 24th, she called her nephews and asked them to collect their basics and documents.
In the evening they went to the basement of a neighbor’s house to spend the night.
Maryna herself couldn't come home, and in principle, she couldn't go home.
No one knew anything about evacuation.

On April 1, the city’s head, Bouchi Anatoli Fedoruk, announced the joyful message of the Ukrainian army on March 31, freed the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the invaders were expelled from the region of Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians should have felt at this moment was eclipsed by terror and hatred, since at the same time it was known that in one time at least 280 peaceful inhabitants were shot by the Russians.
They were killed right in the street, some were tied up and shot in the back, some killed by minors.
The village of Motienne Olga Sughenko, her husband Igorus, and her son, Alexander, were found in the wake of an old man who was kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the brother's grave, Igor to the sewers.

The Russians tried to burn them.

President Vladimir Greenski stated that certain types of arms offered by Western partners were too late.
That's what he said in an interview by Assocated Press, which was published by the President's Office, which says, "European truth."
"All the equipment they're sending is too late for some kinds of equipment.
So what if we're talking about, for example, Maripel, when you're losing thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Greenski.
And on the question, this is enough of the weapons that Ukraine got to make a difference in the war, the president said, "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not be, or it would have a different form.
"It would unfold differently; we would have a shoulder of close neighbors; we could fight together.
But I'm sure there would still be no war," he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister in Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military aid, including bronchials and anti-creative weapons.

And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people, about 400 people, and there was nothing to breathe.

"We've been hiding from our mother-in-law about war.
So far it's working.
However, the fur on the underside and on the back paws of a bottle of fur can be stressful, changes in the cortex, and deficiency of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, and the stress doesn't come from me, unfortunately.
The bottle, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, it hears sirens and explosions."
Because Olga doesn't hear well, and most of the time she spends in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her incognito.
And on April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Paulov, for the first time in his life, took up arms.
"I spent 33 days as a guerrilla living with her in an apartment.
The war was hidden from it, and the fact that I was there came formally as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receiver back -- she listened for four hours, then she sang for two hours."
The radio's always been by the bed.
Most of the time the mother - in - law spends in her room.
It didn't feel good to let me be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her steps, I hid in my room.
First, I hid the receiver and the TV.
Then I called anyone who's talking to her, which is six or seven people.
I asked her to talk to her about anything, not war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
It's April 17th, and I'm cleaning out two apartments:
Good evening, I didn't think about it one day.
Hello, if we need more help tomorrow, we can come.
You have to order, can you take dinner from home?
I offer you men's rods, women's, children's walking out to you, everyone you're sitting in your private messages, the price:
I understand you and don't complain, but in my situation I'll be looking for you here.
I'm telling you, the embassy is just here,
The British, who defended Maripol in the ZSW, said that he was ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British military officer of the United Kingdom Marine Corps, who is involved in the defense of Mariopolis, told his friends and family that they would be armed and would be taken prisoner by Russian invaders.
Source: The twitter page of Aideine Eislin, a British man who has been in the ZSU since 2018, the WC with a reference to the family and friends of Eislin, Atlas News, with a reference to the words of a friend Eslin who spoke to him
And we got a message from him, "It took us 48 days, and we tried everything we could to protect Maripor, but we had no choice but to give in to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammo left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon be over."
Eislin was serving on a 36-part-a-part-a-row Marine Corps which is involved in the Mariopolis defense operation.
Journalists contacted Ann Wood's military mother, and she testified that her son had reported on the phone that they were planning to be taken prisoner.
Military friend Brenan Phillips also confirmed to the journalists that in his last telephone conversation, Eislin told of the plans of their unit from surrender.
He said that the teams had run out of ammunition and food.
The news media contacted his friend Atlas News, who said that Alen's unit is about to surrender to Russian units to avoid being caught without weapons and bullets at the hands of the so-called "cadivores."
Also in social networks, there was an audio recording of a telephone conversation on which Eisling was said to be talking to his familiar American friend, who was planning to travel to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aisling said that they were trying to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British had told us that in Instagram he had been threatened by representatives of the Wagner private military company.
Eislin was a social worker in Newarkon Shorent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he took part in fighting against terrorists called the Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ZSU and took an oath.
Esslin's friends and close friends called Johnny, and in social networks he's better known under Cossack Gundi.

When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition for us to go to Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved a bill of 7176, called "to monitor Ukraine's national security threat to the economy."
It's strange that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security has been... the location the members of the board are holding and holding banks.
Initiators believe that decisions made by the Board of Directors of the Governing Council in Kiev can solve the national security issues of Ukraine in some way.
We know of many new dangers to the home, but as far as we know of any company that requires physical oversight at the location of the board.
The potential threat of such a law has come to realize that it's a great idea to bring together all the gains in the difficult reforms of ownership after the Hyde Revolution, including independent oversight of the board, and then set up manual management.
The same as before 2015.
Why is the board’s watch staff kept, and who should join them?
What's more, if under patriotic slogans one harmful bill can fly off tomorrow -- for example, the state purchase system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Lots of things you can write to war.
This initiative, by the way, came before the beginning of the war and the bill of legislation of 7176.
So on February 22th, this standard was applied to the relative table of the billboard, which is 5397.
In general, though, the desire to spread the board’s oversight has been running around in one way or another among some of the national electors long ago.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but to show the possible consequences of a bill, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for accepting it.
And then let's try to figure out how to deal with the issue of governance during the war.
The First Minister of Economics, Denis Cudin, explained the need for such innovation by risking internet loss and other means of communication that would make it impossible for remote oversight.
In other words, the risk is that the board won't be able to make the necessary decisions, in terms of what a paralyzed company might be doing.
We agree that there is a risk, but will it be prevented from moving officials to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a pretty cynical situation where independent members of oversight councils (most of them) will put their personal safety ahead of the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In such a case, they could be released under a legal arrangement.
And then it's probably going to cause the quadride required to make any decisions.
Instead, it's not going to quickly be able to appoint new independent members of the board, because the law requires that a contestary selection be held on average for three to four months.
Thus, a bill of 7716 decisions is likely to fail to protect the loss of the oversight board of decision making and, rather, lead to it!
The national deputate, author of Dimitry Nataluch, gives other arguments to support it.
In particular, he says, "many businesses, like the defense-prologue complex, now need to be relocation," and so, "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna, discuss addresses and other sensory information."
To begin with, there is hardly any U.S.R.A.A. that has oversight of the board at all in Ukraine.
There's only a surveillance council in the Ucrofortex, which actually manages almost every U.S.A. business.
But even in the Ucrofortex, according to legislation, the board has a pretty limited authority, and all its members are not without a proper basis.
All the full power in the Ucrofort is owned by the CEO, who will, by the way, make decisions as to the need for a location of a particular ISC company that is part of the constitution.
Furthermore, this argument does not stand the criticism of a bill of 7776 that does not change legislation at all that regulates the activities of the U.S.
Dmitri, on his Facebook page, also gives arguments that can be referred to as emotional.
These arguments usually have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of the machine and the banking system, but let's try to do some of them: "Recent Foreign expert experts at the first word "war", leaving Ukraine in 2021, but they're still members of the surveillance boards in Ukraine with the full stock of hundreds of thousands of dollars, while Ukraine itself is really at war."
First of all, it's a manipulation -- most of these surveillance councils have never lived in Ukraine, and they've only come here periodically.
So to say that they're leaving Ukraine, to kind of be fair.
Second, as a result of the pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long used online sessions.
This tool has long been widely used in the world’s practices — business, education, medicine, and so forth.
Not to be overlooked, too, that membership in the board is not a full-time job.
These people usually have other jobs, and the actual means of electronic communication help them to do that.
Third, all these statements are read as claim only to foreigners.
Interestingly, why doesn't Mr. Dmitry express identical claims to members of the oversight boards that are Ukrainians?
They're not at the place to find their companies either.
To say, it's not the first popular attempt of deputees to clear out of the control council foreigners, and war is just a new opportunity.

In Brovarsk, the Wishgorod, and the Bochai districts of Kiev, which were freed from occupations, would set up an increased curfew by two days.
Pauluk's direct speech: "In the populated areas of Brovarski, the Wishgorodes and the Bochains that were under Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew was intense!
In the territory of these towns and villages, it's going to be restrictions on April 21st, April 2 to 6:00, April 5.
Detail: According to the head of the siege, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of communities and in other public places, to travel by transportation and on foot.
Residents can only walk out on alarm signals to pass into hiding.
These restrictions are set in place to remove the effects of Russian aggression by cleaning up and clearing up territory.
Omilunik called on people who had left these areas for so long to refrain from returning home.
At the rest of the region, the curfew will take up to 9: 00 a.m. every day.

The U.S.A. bans investment in PF and sanctions against the daughters of Putin
The United States together with G7 and the EU introduce new sanctions against the daughters of President RF Pointin, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and the Sberbanks, and bans all new investments to Russia.
That's what the White House report says.
Saberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, which is owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the biggest private bank.
The sites will freeze any of their assets that are related to the U.S. financial system, and will prevent U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will enforce a full ban on new investment in PF.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Byden will sign a new edict that includes a ban on new investment in Russia for U.S. citizens regardless of where they are located.
"This step is based on a decision made by over 600 transnational companies that decide to leave Russia.
The output of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, big retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as law firms and consulting firms," says the White House statement.
A third step in new sanctions from the United States was to restrict large Russian state enterprises.
This will prevent U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the US jurisdiction.
The detailed list will be published on the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the packet is the full ban on the assets of Putina's adult children, wife and daughter of Laurov's foreign minister, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex President and prime minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael the Mishnah.
They cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

She brought an announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.
You can call school, Kira doesn't pick up the phone, he doesn't answer, I don't know if he got to school.
They isolate the Russian office: they stop the investment and they stop the supply.
However, we did not understand.
We had no military life in our home.
Our home is next to the military and the oilbasket
He just helped me because I wouldn't have done it myself.
I'm doing good cooking, I'm not asking too much, and I'm giving good advice.
I'm taking care of myself.
It's a little hard for me, but I know I have to go through this phase.
I'll meet you on Thursday and tell you everything.
It's all right.
Party, how often do you clean up?
I clean every week.
I don't have any software, but I'll try to figure it out.
I Wanted to Be a Teacher
My girls can't move around right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you heard for information, you'd let me know.
I'd love to rent a house with some decent girl.
If you might know one, let me know.
I won't let you down on my side.
Thank you in advance.
Natalie, who's 54 years old, didn't write you another person. Please write to the exact address and how much the course cost.
I think it's best for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
My name wasn't changed. It's one since I was born.
I'm sorry I didn't see it, I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna send it to you right away.
We're going to medical right now.
I mean, I have to work out an hour on another day.
What day is it better for her to come earlier? (can do some more work on what day?)
I'll hear you tomorrow, the Internet is bad.
You're gonna do what you're gonna do.
Thank you... there's something from the stuff, but there's nothing from the technique...
Both beginners except the alphabet, we don't know anything.
Nothing's happening.
May I see Monday 25,04?
You can take the children with you and the toys are enough.)
I Learned About Dad
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll figure something out with this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how would it be paid, please, no credits.
Write me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
Should we take the clothes we've given?
It's not my day today.
Something came from you, I don't see that.
I'm also very sad.
I'm going to remind you later on.
You only have a dad who speaks Russian and understands Russian?
What kind of day does a colleague want to do cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I'm ashamed I'm distracting you from what you're doing.
Good evening, I can't share it with you.
I'd like to read Joe Dispanz, and he's doing research on external factors and the formation of new connections.
Natalie Nagoran, a newspaper columnist, published a video in the morning of April 12, which was handed over to her by a 36th Marine Corps team in Mariland.
In it the military said that they had no gun left to take part in the battles and the mountain of the wounded.
They said "count takes hours."
Prior to this, on April 11, 36th, a separate Marine Corps team, which is involved in the defense of Marivpolis, issued a petition to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement was that April 11 might be the last battle for the defenders of Marivor, and the Ukrainian command was not connected to the fighting for two weeks.
The social media expressed skepticism that the statement had been published in Russian.
The Chief Commander of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, Valery Schiech, assured us that the command connection to the defense forces in Maripolis is there, and the details of defense operations should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters from being in the area of the Ozoustal plant in Mariupolis and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian invaders dropped a poisonous substance on Maripol that had no previous origin.
As reported by the leader of "Azova" Andrei Bieecki, the RF army used chemical weapons over the Azvostall plant to hold the Azovians.
Thank you, I'll be moving under you.
The situation is the same for now.
( 2) Take a trip, Mom shopping, and back!
It's not important.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The Czechā drones have since begun their flight over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional cops--they're going to be for detection, and some of them are for the immediate destruction of the enemy invader--
Two Czech and Zacarpathian brothers were sent to Ukraine before yesterday by the deputee Muchaechev city council of Vladimir Ladek.
Today, because they're from the middle-up friends led by the council head and coordinator of the country council and the coordinator of https: / /www. facebook.com/ examplere101/ Vasil Shield, they've been delivered by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities where there's still going to be fighting.
For the most effective and safe use of the copters, their dissocracy is to remain a secret.
The four friends who help the Ukrainian army in Czechia on the mission are not planning to stop, saying that many more interesting “gifts ” will be sent to Ukraine in the coming days to save the lives of the Russian invaders and to save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I love sweetness, but I can go without it.
I'm worried we won't make it, a lot of luggage.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, keep working.
All right, if it's all right, I'll do it.
I'll try it myself, but if they break out, I'll write you down if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the elderly lady in the village of Java, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said there was no shelter
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll feel better.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm freezing on the street today, too.
I drank medicine and tea, and I feel worse, but I'm not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop the music you like.
I'm especially interested in the musical success you've had. . . . . . . . . . . .
Mom and Dad Need to Obey
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
It was colder today and it was raining, and it should be warm tomorrow.
But it's not a pity for destroyed houses, it's a pity for people being mistreated by the invaders.
Guerson was rid of the J.A.S.S.S.S.A. Memorial in Gerson on Percopsk Street.
It says that the European Union's flag was broken by the unknown, smashed panels with photographs of Heaven's hundreds, and killed in the Russian - Ukrainian war.
Occupants ripped off pictures of Heaven's hundreds of heroes and dead participants in the Russian - Ukrainian war.
They brought down the flag.
Good morning, thank the kids for the carol, we don't have this custom, so we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else we needed to give
There's someone to talk to if there's one.
Because I'm living like a dorm room till twelve, there'll be people here, and then they'll go to work.
Hello, it's a little better.
I was in the pits today.
Even today, I was sleeping there.
So we are making great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring the cooks another time!
today, I have no strength to do them.
As I push away from days and hours of cleaning, I can say roughly on April month because I already have a close - up schedule for cleaning apartments.
In May of the month, I'll be able to say something at the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it....
Hey,I'm sorry I haven't made a note about dinner and slept for a while.
If you don't mind, can I come here tonight?)
or meet me after your arrival.)
He's modest in us, and he's been studying a lot lately, and he needs to know how much he needs it.
Hey, it went pretty well.
I was a bit shocked to be working with people at such a high position.
Now she had a lesson from a lady who's the director of an economic department of the edge.
She was very pleased with my work.
The hole in the pits was fine.
On Monday, I have to get confirmation of my employment as well as cash payment for my gums.
I'm gonna quit Friday.
I don't do a lot of things to them, and I sleep a lot of water.
If I go to a doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if you can.
I've got to get another test.
You don't have to go again.
It's a bad thing, it's a bad thing to wash away, you need a master, you need to fix it.
So there's all that's left.
Can you send me the correct e-mail address?
I'd like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course that you've been enrolled in.
And the children are being fed there or should they be brought with them?
Now, one more question could I ask you for a moment.
If help is needed, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating the Passover tonight, right?
From the beginning, we didn't really want you to raise money so that people wouldn't think we were up to it!
But I didn't have two options for online filling:
I'm going to have to rest, take strength and energy, thank you for today's gift.
Now let me see the video, it's going to be good because the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Karazi calls for workers and students to check carefully any information, not to trust anonymous sources in vigilantes and social networks, gossip and gossip.
All you need to do is accept legal information.
Yes, you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who remains in Ukraine, also helps the army.
I collected a few pieces of work for my portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet should be held.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How do I count the day that I wasn't at work?
Russia is preparing a provocation in the Pridnby to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in Moldova's Pridda District to accuse Ukraine of "in aggression against the neighboring state."
It's literally: "There is no exception to the armed forces of the Russian Federation ofggressive Action in the Sydney Republic of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for action on the Slobboan direction.
Likely in the coming days, the invaders will try to recover the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and ship his Personnel, arms, and equipment to take part in fighting activities in Ukraine’s territory.
The training of arms and military equipment is under way in the series of continuous dislocations of the 60th single shell crew of 5th Russian army of the Eastern army.
Likely, the weapons indicated will be moved to temporarily occupied areas of the Donkey region.
Also, in order to restore the loss of the property of the Battalion tactical Group, a group of 36 individual gunfighters (Borzia, Zabaykalland) forces, 29 members of the Eastern army are being carried out by a set of military officers from the group mentioned by the crew.
The enemy especially feels the problem when he sets up driving and driving mechanics.
The stay of the selected person is scheduled for the second half of April of this year.
Likely, the opponent, in order to disrupt shipments to battlegrounds, will continue to strike traffic infrastructure in Ukraine in order to destroy or excrete them.
The defined units of the civil forces of Belarus continue to carry out the task of strengthening the Ukraine - Belarusian border in the region of Brestsk and the Gomelle region.
In the Slobodish direction, individual units of the 6th general army and coastal forces of the northern fleet continue to partially block the city of Harkov, continuing to take up artillery shootings in certain parts of the city.
There's air exploration in the Izumian direction to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
That's why the opponent uses the Orlan-10 PLA.
By force of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy was trying to attack in the directions of the population of Long and Dmitri, and he had no success and he was moving back to his previously busy positions.
In the Doneic direction, the enemy’s main efforts continue to focus his attention on the employment of the Posagna, Rubigin, Lower, and Nobahmut, as well as on the establishment of complete control of the city of Maripor.
The enemy tried to storm the Gold area, and he did not succeed.
In Maripol, with the help of artillery and airlines, the invaders continue to storm in the areas of the Azvostal plant and the port of the sea.
With the forces of individual units, the enemy was executing artillery shootings of Ukrainian troops in areas of the population of Highpil, Trudovsk, and Maryansk.
In the area of Donneksky and Luhan, Ukraine’s defenders suffered four enemy attacks within a century, destroyed five tanks, eight body units of armored, six parts of automobile equipment, and eight artillery systems.
Don't you understand what you're thinking?
Of course we'll try long, but I doubt it.
How can you sleep and I hold you back?
You sure you want me to come?
Maybe you just don't want to see me tonight, so tell me, I'll understand everything.
Thank you, we weren't watching TV at home, we didn't have to tune in:
I'm here to turn on television just to listen to Czech.
I'm running out of tariffs today.
Can we do it on the phone today?
Buy fabric for sewing, cana, and stitching
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her, I'm a little embarrassed to ask her, and so many pies give us.
We'll meet my father later, I'm sure.
I've read an exercise on Facebook, so Google must have written something on his own.
Good morning, we brought the things you brought, but there are things you can bring us in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director has a deal, I can start going to work from the next week because I plan to go to the office tomorrow morning to give the papers (if they do, because the queues are too big) and on Saturday it rains:)
I'm looking for a crew at the beginning, and I love chemistry at school, and I learn Czech so I can know the dream of working in Tewi.
Friends of old and not very old, friends I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you too have a hard time.
I've been talking to a lot of you in the last month.
Your life, which has never been easy without it, has turned upside down, as have the lives of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilty and ashamed because of your country's actions toward your neighbors.
Because of what they're doing to Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been in danger, and you've been preparing for a decisive blow.
Early in March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorilla."
I'll tell you a little bit later, – as usual, the sasa replied in a spare way. – I'm going to walk through the ruins right after the search.
Others are cultural leaders, artists, critics, writers, struck by the sudden siege of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: aside from very few of you -- those who worked in "Memorial," the New paper, the "Echo Moscow," the "Meduzi," the Naval and the set of other places -- did many of you at least do anything to oppose this regime?
Except for being involved in the protests while they were still happening.
Read also a column of Russian journalist, "It's time to hide, it's late to keep quiet."
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt isn't just abstraction?
Perhaps they are because of your long - term indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy, and your passive singing, which may now have been a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always that way.
In the 1990s, there was a short period of time when you, to some extent, enjoyed freedom and democracy -- indiscriminately even bloody, but true.
But 1991 turned out to be no better year than 1917.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, you end up in such great fear of grief that you're looking for salvation behind the king, let's say his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still think he's safer.
Indeed, errors were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the KGB archives, like the Company Germans did, you took your soul to the Dzery monument, and allowed the KGB to sink, to update, to change, and to take over the country.
When you were given a choice between burglaries and communists' return, you didn't fight for the possibility of a third choice, and you humbly accepted robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass protests for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became a major concern.
The young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but either you voted for it or you preferred not to vote at all.
When he started to compare Chechnya to the ground again, most of you closed your eyes.
I remember well those years.
I was working in Chechnya, helping those who suffered from anti-terrorist surgery, and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Groznoy, Katar Yurta, Itum-Kala, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would come back to Moscow and hang out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the tortures of peaceful citizens, of children killed, of soldiers who sold the bodies of their families.
You told me, "Bred, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
And I said, "My friends, it's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your power that will bomb one of your cities, kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of the zero, due to increasing oil prices and a willingness to condone the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in middle - class pockets.
Many of you have become well - off, some have become wealthy, even the poorest of you have obtained new housing and better jobs.
Prices went up, didn't they?
Moscow was enjoying a festival and bald from its neck.
When several oppositionors were killed — George Szczekochin, Anne of the Politsk, Aleksandr Litsochka, and others — many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was going on.
Still, things were not going on.
When, after two terms, Putin passed President Madvedev's post, and he gave himself the prime minister, you, as I can see, hardly paid attention.
When Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of Medvedev, most of you ignored it or said no.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Guevauri, in the foothills of Kasbegi or in the cafés and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it's unlikely that we in the West did a lot of things if we did anything at all.
A little resentment, a little sanction; but what was the significance of Russia’s breaking international law when such temptation to Russian oil, gas, and an inner market was so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, that was the most important.
But by the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, were still awake.
When Putin again switched places with Medvedev and planted the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you stepped out on protests.
The name Naval became provoked, you weren't walking out of the streets for half a year, and the regime ended up feeling terrible that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
At first alternative action was organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were imprisoned.
Some were given huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The dragon is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Disgusted by the Prostitute President who had fooled their European hopes, they once captured Maidan and never left him again.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armatures, and cocktails of Molotov.
Finally the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
The refugee was Janukowicz, and the Ukrainians turned democracy back, the right to choose their own leaders and expel them if they didn't do their job well.
But he didn't like Putina very much.
That was a bad example.
So with general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, yet few benefits have been gained.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the Anxia.
From there a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putina and his cap suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to idolize it.
I find it hard to find a reason, since we stopped talking right after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, IEA catalogs and parks, as new after the restoration, which the mayor of Moscow started in 2012, with their Binbegs, popularly accessible by Vayfa and Hipsteric cafes.
Actually, Donbas is so far away, but Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You hardly paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
WHALE or something, even the Moscow editor, who released my book on Syria, exposed it at the time in an interview, because I didn't really understand what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I saw people shooting cold - blooded at my kids on the streets of Thomas.
There were only your soldiers among all Russian citizens who started bombing thousands of civilians in 2015, having experience for the next major war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
"First they came to socialists, but I said, 'cause I'm not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I said, because I'm not a member of the union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I spoke, because I'm not Jewish.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you have been told about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some really speak right now -- like Dimitry Glouchovsky, Michael Schishkin, Michael Zighar, Maxim Osingz, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Oscenovovovovov, risking entry into the new GLAG or building the Naval company.
As for others, you know the best place in which you live.
So, I'm sure you realize that when Putin gets out of the country -- or what seems very likely if he doesn't, he'll take care of you.
For all of you, my friends, for those of you who are brave but for the most part in private were protesting and were still a minor experience, but they will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you, who signed the petition, who expressed a disagreement in social networks (see even a black square in Instagram), or spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation were given simply for the joke, not in the distant past, and they are now, with great likelihood, waiting for you in the future.
Who will be left to speak for you?
The example of Ukrainians is even more than 2014, which is a scary mode of travel: they argue you can fight it.
And that mind, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive he may be on paper.
In view of all of this, few in Russia are aware of this as well as that there is a war at all.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you communicate.
And Putin knows what you know.
So keep your eyes open.
You know where everything goes.
Good life in exchange for your silence is over.
Your election is just a hobby, your laws, if you don't mind the repressive, are worth no more than the paper they're written on, your last free media are gone, your economy is ruined faster than I'm writing, you don't have credit cards to buy a flight ticket abroad, even if there are some flights left.
Now Putin won't be satisfied with your silence, he'll demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try either go somewhere or you're crushed.
I doubt you can see another option.
And yet there is one more.
Which eventually violates this regime.
And perhaps, under the circumstances that have been made, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
It's not going to break out of you, because of the economic collapse that's coming on Russia, it's probably going to burn in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices went down and wages were not paid, the people who voted for Putin all those years because they wanted bread and peace would come out on the street.
Putin knows this and he fears these people far more than he fears intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, which is you friends of mine.
But if every city comes out on its own, as it's been on a periodic basis, it won't be hard for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be required.
You have this wonderful magic tool, the Internet, that can be limited, but that still works and that can be fixed in almost any circumstance.
The Naval Organization was destroyed, but others could be created, more informal, more decentralized.
You're so many, you're millions.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If it comes out of over 300,000, it'll be stunned.
We have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putina when it gets to work?
After everything he made them go to Ukraine, what did he make them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will be conscious of fear: but those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be scared in your place too.
In Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happened to those who dared to neglect their master, who dared not only to demand freedom but who really tried to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game and be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet and be arrested; your good friend will make a mistake and die in a raw cell under police oaks.
That's what's been happening for years, and it's only going to get bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice, if you don't do anything, you know what it's going to be.
Use cold blood, think strategically, and reach for this to become reality.
We were on Friday night, and we were told that we could visit Monday.
We'll be home in the evening
What You Think of Me as a Secretary's Press
Hey, how often do you go to dinner in a expensive restaurant?
once a river i'm looking for dinner in a expensive restaurant
I will try to explain everything to her.)
That's how we liked it. It's nice and we wanted something better. That's why it's a better option.
I went to a place where there was a lot of people, and I got a lot of energy.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, voice, weakness, and head spinning
I have to go to that government of labor.
We've already done this, but who's been registered in April only at the end of the month
On Thursday, we have to get a ride, go to the doctor with the children.
But at night I was told by a lady who liked your job, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'm sure to tell her.
While working at the prosecutor's office, I thought I was going to be a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work that left me completely disillusioned.
I'm sorry for the time I've lost, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am outgoing, yet I am committed to marriage in a serious way.
There was a man I was supposed to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I think people will grow up to love, to respect, to trust each other.
I haven't met that yet.
Good afternoon. Where do you get the shapes for baking the pastes?
Okay, thanks for the advice, I'm going to file the Val's certificate.
She's got a DCP lying down, she's got a leg broken in a plaster, a wheelchair in a lying position, and so the whole thing is rubbed up in a blender.
Mr. Rhaeard, I'm sorry I'm worried about you at work time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's room today, and I'd like to say hello to her.
She had a bad situation.
Because when the children left, a mother refused to take the child, for she said she had come to see things and to lay them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our baby’s room until 7: 00 p.m.
Could that really be so?
It's time for the room until 4:00.
Finally, that is our responsibility.
But I'm not having a hard time not opening the very weak Internet.
Good morning, we're doing well. Colia's working well, she's filling up the counter yesterday, and I was doing the seniors before the exam.
It's harder to get the magic from geometry.
Vladimir helped us on Saturday.
Vica is studying universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We Are Thankful for Our Homes
Yeah, I thought you didn't fill it up.
We're going to try to do a maximum sum by the end of the week to calculate.
Russian invasion situation is a briefing by the advisor Ofisus President Alexis Arestoicz. ( 10.04,2022)
The President's adviser, Ofis, told of the heroic act of an army chief in Marivpolis, who was surrounded and wounded, so he blew himself up with a radio station so that she would not be given to an opponent.
I've got a very important question, is it going to help me count my granddaughter for five years (a bronchial asthma) now she's got pumps and chrysops...
We need a family doctor for her to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
The doctor’s advice is urgent....
We live in the Czech Republic Dolní Chabry. We need a doctor who's both here in Dolní Chabry or somewhere near maybe Brno but not far from the subway so we can get there.
The butterfly exhibition was very much appreciated.
The butterflies would sit on their arms and feet.
How's your day?
I'm so grateful, no words, thank you very much.
Mom's standing there at 4:00 a.m.
Perhaps the housewife will leave her cell phone to communicate.
I think it's the best option for me in Prague 8.
Mr. Director didn't tell me anything about sponsoring payment for a child's lunch.
They gave me that kind of data to pay for.
For part of March and April, I had already paid for my diet.
