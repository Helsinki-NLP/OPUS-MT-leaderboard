The members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that they will “be associated with maps. ”
For some, the recommendation to change their title to “a member of Parliament of Wales ” (MWP) is frightening.
This recommendation came out of plans to change the name of the assembly at the Valve of Wales.
The current of the political spectrum is concerned that this may provoke ridicule.
One of the protesters said that his group was troubled by the rum of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, 'twp' means 'instupid', and 'pwpwp' means act of defecation.
Beginning with the Paris Party of Wales, the group in general “is not satisfied ” and offers alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said that his ‘ open - minded ’ group was about to change the name, but he noted that the MWP could quickly become a ‘popete’.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to that of the Yoruba English pronunciation “u. ”
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing legislation to change names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the assembly will certainly be made by members alone.”
The rule of self - government in Wales for 2017 gives the Wells Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the commission published a public discussion of proposals, and the adoption of the Assembly in Parliament of Wales received wide support.
As to what it is called, the Commission proposes to call them ‘ member states of Parliament, ’ or WMP, but the MWP version has received the greatest public support.
Of course, the course of action offers alternatives, but attempts to reach agreement may cause problems for the chairman, Elin Jones, who should provide a bill for change within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, among which rules of separation and structure of the committee system.
The course will lead to final voting as to its new name as they discuss legislation.
The Macedonians are going to vote for a referendum to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, the voters vote for the country’s name to be changed to the Northern Macedonia Republic.
The vote was organized to settle years of controversy with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly challenged the membership of Macedonia in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia George Ivanov, who opposed the change of name, claimed that he would ignore the voting results.
However, advocates of the referendum, among whom Prime Minister Zoran Zavé, argue that the change in name is just the price to pay for entering the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin keep quiet, because Harlem's churches are going through difficult times.
“The old people I've been talking to say that there was a bar and a church here at every corner, ” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars is understandable:
"In our time, people are being socialized differently.
The bars are no longer the local living room they regularly visit.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect, and “early or later they will end up where they started. ”
The churches, he added, could replace homes with condomium, and there would be people living who would not help the shrines nearby.
“ The vast majority of people who buy condomiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches are closed, since it is unlikely that most of those who move to the condominium will become their patrons. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community is built in 1870 and St. Martin is built ten years later.
Corinna, a white Methodist community, left in the 1930s.
The Black Community, which conducted rituals nearby, received the property of the building.
Saint Martin went to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main trading street of Harlem, and these merchants didn't want to accept blacks and raise them up.
In 1939 the building was badly damaged by fire, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to rebuild it and set up a fleet.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor to Father Johnson in St. Martine, proudly called the kallion the poor.
The expert who played the Carrillion in July called it a different way: a cultural treasure and an “inchangeable historical instrument. ”
This expert, Tiffani Ng of Michigan University, also pointed out that this is the world's first carrillion, where a black musician named Dionicio A. Lind, 18 years ago, went to a bigger millions in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merryweather said that in St. Martin's he had no replacement.
What's happening in Saint-Marten over the past few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of which have been involved with church leaders, some of which are episcopies.
The Council is a leading parish authority made up of lay leaders, and in July it wrote the diocese concerned that the diocese was “to try to pass on the costs” and was pleased not to participate in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some churchgoers complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy who dived behind lobbyers in California was injured.
According to official figures, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and hit him, and the boy dived behind the lobbyers in California on the day he opened the lobbyers season.
The attack took place almost 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that in the morning he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and along with the group came to him to get out of the water.
At first Hammel thought it was a thrill to see the caught lobbyer, but then he realized that the boy was screaming: “I was bit!
I was bit! ’
As soon as he reached the boy’s destination, he found that his key was completely broken.
“ I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, ‘ In the water of the shark, ’ ” he added.
The boy was taken to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The sight of an attack shark is unknown.
A rescue captain, Larry Jaels, told us that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in this area, but it was determined that it did not refer to dangerous species of sharks.
Jailes added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the body.
For the sake of investigation and security, the authorities for 48 hours closed down access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas.
Jailes noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsburgy's plans are to go to the British cosmetics market
Sainsburg's going to compete with Bots, Superdreug and Debenhams using islands with makeup similar to those in the department store.
In an increased output to the British space market, $2.8 billion is continued to grow, while the sale of clothing and goods for the house goes down) the enlarged islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and in the next year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics are related to supermarkets looking for ways to use the general space that had been used under television, microwave ovens, and household goods.
Science's said that they're going to double the makeup of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 goods, which are going to be the first brands of Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Mabelline, and Burt's get more space: there's going to be brand zones, similar to those in stores like Bots.
Supermarket is also updated by the Boutique Cosmetic Aortics Act: most of the goods presented will not now be tested on animals, which are increasingly required by young customers.
In addition, the retailer of the Parammeria Fragrance Sp protests his trays at two Sonsburg's stores: the first tray opened at Croydon, northern London, last week, and the second one opens at Selli-Ouk, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and moving to the purchase of small amounts of food every day at small stores forces supermarkets to make extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coop, executive director of Science's, said that their shops would become more like a department store because the supermarket network is trying to counter Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-sold goods.
Science's opening Argos departments in hundreds of their stores, also an open series of Hubbits' departments.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to update cosmetics and pharmaceutical goods failed.
Sainsburg's tested the collaboration with Bots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a debate about how to separate the income from the drugstores in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsburg's sold his apothetic business (281 drugstore) Celesio, the owner of the Loyds Pharmary network, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
They agreed that Loyds would help by adding an extended stocking of the hatching brands to skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Viche, four shops.
Paul Mills-Hyx, the commercial director of Science, stated: “We have changed the appearance of our little islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant for customers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who could give advice.
We're presented with brands as a means to meet any needs, and a pleasant atmosphere and a comfortable location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is competition for the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones went out of a deal worth $11 million.
Dragon Star Peter Jones "surpassed" because TV host Holly Willoby has come out of an agreement with his brand of living goods (a value of 11 million pounds) to focus on new Marks & Spencer and ITV contracts
Willoby doesn't have time for a brand of home clothes and axeziers truly.
Business couples were associated with Goop Gnnet Peltro's brand.
The 37-year-old program chairman This Manning announced its entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willoby has brought the Dragon View star Peter Jones to the point where at the last moment, she left their lucrative business of living goods to focus on the new lucrative Marks & Spencer and ITV contracts.
Sources report that Jones is "surpassed" when a golden girl on TV confessed to having an intense meeting on Tuesday at Jones's Brooklyn, in Marlou, Binghamshire, that her new deals cost 1.5 million pounds, mean she doesn't have enough time to dedicate it to their joint brand of home clothes and to the Axesares of the Triily.
This business was connected with the Goop Gvinet Peltro brand and had to double the number of Willob's worth of $11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoby reported to Instagram that he was leaving Troly, Jones flew from Great Britain to one of his rest houses.
The source reported: “Trually, no doubt, was the main priority of Holly.
He would be her long - term future for the next few decades.
Willoby’s decision to get out of business shocked all the interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
The Marlou headquarters is full of stuff ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the entrance of The Manning, one of Britain’s most highly paid stars, could cost millions of dollars because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes), and to create further delays with launch.
This can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoby and Capp created a Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of rule in March.
Couples held festivals together, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s shares in telemarketing.
Willoby will be the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Anthony Mcpartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
A source near Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his case. ”
“ We fell in love with each other after that ”
He was joking about the criticism he received from the news media for a comment that some would consider “not presidential ” and for a very positive attitude toward the leader of North Korea.
“ Why did President Trump make such big concessions? ”
said Tramp, simulated the voice of the lead news. — “I’m sorry. ”
I didn’t make any concessions. ’ ”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Tramp called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step toward the denocleralization of North Korea.
But denocleralization negotiations have gone to a dead end.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the leading diplomat of North Korea, Ring Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a ‘ firing reaction ’ from the United States to its first steps on disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to give support to blood pressure.
When giving a speech at his poll, Tramp was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he declared.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions would be killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship.”
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had a positive effect: the end of rocket testing, the release of hostages, and the return of the remnants of American military servants home.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke of his relationship with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this fight at the stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there, ” said Tramp, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island with hundreds of dead
In particular, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told that their help was unnecessary.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboka’s population was affected, national catastrophes were not announced, and this is a prerequisite for international aid.
“ In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they don’t seek international aid, so it’s a little hard, ” said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children, a team is being set up for a trip to Palm, as far as it is concerned that the foreign personnel will be able to work in place.
Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster - Disposal Agency, stated that Indonesian authorities appreciate the situation in Palau to determine whether to allow international aid.
Considering the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unpretentious to the wrath of nature.
In the province of Aceh, tsunami shelters are built, but they are not typical of other coastlines.
The apparent absence of the siren to warn of the tsunami in Palau, though warnings were effective, likely contributed to death.
It is not just in the best of times that people move between the many Indonesian islands.
Science is making it even more difficult to cope with natural disasters.
The medical ship in Lombok for treatment of earthquake victims is heading for Palau, but it can reach a new disaster in at least three days.
President Joco Uiddo made improvements in Indonesia's infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased road and railway spending.
But financing deficits have created problems for Mr. Joco's administration, who is planning to move on in the next year.
Mr. Joco also opposes long - standing interfaith enmity in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands of homeless, as a result of opposition to Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets, using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Detective Inspector Brian O'Hanhan commented: “Exploration is now in its early stages, but I'm asking everyone who's been near John Street at Birkenhead to see or hear something suspicious, to contact us.
I also ask all, especially the taxis, who could do something on video director, to contact us, because the information on these videos can be very important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the building.
Today in the afternoon friends who believe they know the woman came to the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police stated that they are currently informing the victim’s immediate relatives.

The statue of Cromwell at Parliament becomes a new monument that will be affected by “resultance of history”
The removal of the statue would have been deserved for the destruction of the Taliban style of many cultural and religious artifacts in England that were carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Camel Community called Mr. Krick's proposal "ductual" and“ an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmitt, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: “In view of the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Krumwell’s statue at Westminster Palace would be a target.”
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither performed by Romil nor by his command.
It is likely that he will receive an undeserved sacrifice for the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, in the preceding century.
The great statue of Cromwell, sculptor William Hamo Tornecroft, is a testimony to the sentiments of the 19th century and a part of the history of the figure that many think is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmitt told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, probably by the end of the 19th century, are considered by him to be a defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether such an idea is accurate or accurate — the subject of historical debate that persists.
There is no doubt only that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures that represents one side of this conflict.
Its achievements as a Lord-Reservator should also be celebrated and honored.”
A killer pig killed a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the name Yuang, was found dead in blood with a torn artery near a lead shop in Liusançu, Guzhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinn, Cinhai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, the pigs are going to be vaccinated in the pigs ’ denture.
It is reported that in Wednesday, he moved with his cousin from the nearby province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs in the marketplace.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and found the lead door open.
The brother pointed out that the pigfish had a large boar with blood on its mouth.
The court-martial expert confirmed that the 229-pound boar had knocked the farmer to death.
“ My cousin's legs were in blood and deformed, ” declared the victim's cousin, who had the name W, who was quoted as Guyang Evening News.
A recording of the security chamber showed that Yuang had come to market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
An animal that killed a man did not belong to Juna or to his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence on the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent her attack on the people.
It's reported that seven of me, Yuany, and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, pigs have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and injured a man in serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 - pound pig had held the Welsh farmer pressed onto a tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CB News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a triger.
“ They’re just playful.
They're like children, very curious... and they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect, ” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants will bring torrential rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa predicted that as it moves over the cooler waters of northern Mexico’s northern coast, it would weaken.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains and floods to northern Mexico and southwestern America.
Rosa had winds of 137 kilometers per hour, which is a hurricane of 1 5 in the morning, east of Sunday, and she was about 620 kilometers southwest of Punta-Evgenia, Mexico.
It is expected that on Sunday, Rosa will go north.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a vesicle that moves east to the west coast of the United States, and as we approach the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, in a tropical storm, it begins to push strong tropical humidity north to the Southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 25.4 centimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the near days, tropical humidity, which interacts with approaching logella, will create strong rainfall in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 centimeters of rain will cause hazardous flooding, garbage streams, and mud slides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will result in a rise in rainfall in places of between 5 and 7.6 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2cm of rain is expected in some parts of the Southwest, especially in a significant area of Arizona.
Flooding can be disastrous when conditions are rapidly worsening because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We are encouraged not to walk into the desert, for tropical rain may be possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons raging rivers, and thunderstorms can bring rushing winds and dust storms.
It will cause severe rains in parts of the northern coast of California to approach.
The rainfall can exceed a quarter of an inch [1.27 cm] in length, which can cause heavy streams of garbage and slippery roads.
It's going to be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday morning and Monday, and Monday evening and Tuesday rain will be more widespread.
There's going to be a heavy rain coming over "For Corners" on Tuesday.
October can see intense temperatures across the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the Tropics remain quite warm.
In some cases, this causes temperatures to drop sharply over short distances.
Sunday will be a fine example of a sudden temperature swing in the middle of the United States.
It's almost seven degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omama, Nebraska, and also between St. Louis and De Moins, Iowa.
During the next few days, the summer will make a warm attempt to return and spread again.
It is expected that much of the center and east of the United States will be warm until October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C.].
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long - term weather forecast, average temperatures in the eastern United States are high in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have been observed listening to Bretta Cavano’s case
On Thursday, over 20 million people on six television networks watched the exciting testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court Justice Brenta Cavano and Christine Blazi Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence that had occurred in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, channels interrupted scheduled programs to report the last news of Friday: a treaty prepared by senator Jeff Flyk, on a single week's investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavano was wearing her drunk and was trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavana said that he was 100 percent sure he wasn't.
It is quite likely that more than 20.4 million people were watching this Friday, reported by Nielsen, the research company.
The company calculated CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNB.
Cannot get numbers right away on other networks which also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And also, Nielssen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
By comparison, such an audience is about the size of an audience watching a series of Leyoffs or the Occar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose thought showers strongly supported Cavanaugh's appointment, was the leader of all channels during a listening session that lasted the entire day, with a medium of 5.69 million people, reported in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielssen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNNs had 2.5 million.2 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flake became the central figure of the 5th drama.
The office of this temperate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Cavano, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS were recorded as protesters shouted at Flake when he tried to go to the elevator to hear the Court Committee.
He stood with his eyes swollen for a few minutes, during which he was cursed, which was being broadcast on live live on CNN.
“ I am standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth of the country?
He was told, "You have authority, and countless women are powerless."
Flick reported that his office had published a statement and that before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more on the committee’s hearing.
All cable and wide - speaking channels were broadcast for hours later, when the Court Committee was to vote on the prosecution of the Cawano candidates to vote for the Senate in a complete warehouse.
Flick said that he would only do it if he knew that the FBI was looking at the charges against the candidate next week, which a democratic minority demands.
Flake has been partly persuaded by discussions with his friend, Democrat senator Chris Cuns.
After a conversation with Cunes, and then with a few other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flacke's choice had an impact, because it was obvious that the Republicans would have no vote to assign Cawano's candidates without investigation.
President Trump initiated the FBI's investigation of the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May blames the critics of politics around Brexite
In an interview with The Sunday Times, the prime minister, Teresa May, blamed her critics for her plans to leave the European Union in politics with future Britain and to undermine national interests.
On September 29, 2018, Great Britain's Prime Minister Teresa May attended a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain.

The volcano dumps ashes in Mexico City
Mount Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital city.
The National Center for Disaster Warning on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater was active and 183 gas emissions and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center followed numerous noises and tremors.
A social network photo shows thin layers of ash on the lobby of cars in the neighborhood of Mexico City, such as Cherimilko.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 in central Mexico in September 2017.

Police came in contact with Catalonian separatists before the anniversary of the national vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence faced a special police unit, and thousands of people joined a protestant demonstration to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on the division.
The Proveparative masked group held back by the special men laid them with eggs and powdered paint that created dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The subjects took place and later on that day, the police used clubs to maintain aggression.
A few hours later, independence groups that scanned “Let’s Not Forget, Let’s Not Forgive! ” encountered supporters of the preservation of the country shouting,“ Spain lives! ”
According to a local press report, fourteen people were helped to cope with the minor injuries they suffered during protests.
A year after a referendum on October 1, which was declared Madrid illegal but marked by Catalan separatists, tension in an independent region remains high.
The voters usually voted for independence, but the hole was low, since most of those who opposed the separation were fighting.
According to Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in brutal encounters last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region.
The independence groups spent the night in tents on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it had to follow another route.
The 68-year-old Narsis Termes, the electricity involved in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“ Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched as my parents shed tears of joy that they could vote, but now we are at a dead end, ” he said.
In spite of the vital but very complex victory at the regional elections last December, the Catalan party for independence failed to preserve the momentum of this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment in anticipation of their participation in the conference organization and their subsequent proclamation of independence.
Hoan Puyg, a 42-year-old mechanic who protested for police support on the phone, claimed that conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“ Stress is getting worse, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oryol Hunqueras, one of the nine Catalonian leaders who have been in the investigator since the end of last year, announced that he will be running for the European Parliament the following year.
“The candidate’s title in European elections is the best way to condemn democratic values and repression that we see from the Spanish government, ” he said.
Londoners: The men were arrested after the car drove into the house
Three men, at the age of 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after driving several times into a building in Londoner.
The intern happened at Ballinagard Crosset at 7:30 a.m. for the British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Bemmings noticed that the gate was damaged and the house itself was damaged.
At some point, it is quite possible that at some point a car was shot out of an armbalt.
The Mengae strike provided a Lewingston victory over the Rangers with a score of 1-0
Dolly Menga’s first goal in Lawingston became victorious
The highest in the Lawingston class was shocked by the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard the second defeat of 18 games as the manager of the Aybrox Club.
Dolly Menga’s strike proved to be decisive: Gary Holt’s team climbed one level per second from Hibernian.
Gerard's team won no prize at the Premier Station of this season, and next Sunday, he plays with the Hearts leaders, from whom it's eight points off.
Before that, Thursday Rangers will be accepted as the Rare Under Vienna as part of the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, the Riverston continues its invincible march to six games in the Division, and Chief coach Holt has not yet been defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
The Riverston gives way to the chances that an unremitting visitor will be able to do so.
The Holt team was supposed to be in front long before they were killed, because their directness created all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through defense, but made a strike along the gate, then Alan Litgo hit the gate after he had turned against it and took the beat of Craig Holkett along the gate which he had made his head.
The Masters were satisfied that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause trouble to visitors from standard positions.
The last goal was to be killed.
The Rangers released a free blow, and the Riverston opened, Dellan Gallagher and Robinson took Meng, who took the ball and shot him from the penal center.
Until this stage, the Rangers had dominated the home of the ball, but the defense of the lords of the fields had turned out to be impassable, and the Liama Kelley gate was largely unsettling.
The trend continued in the second mystery, although Alfredo Morelos managed to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittmann hit down the door with his feet, the Ringer's, Allan McGegor, and Litgo hit the gate in another standard Lewings.
The curtains were constantly brought into the Lavingston fine and were constantly neutralized, and two applications for the penalty — after Galket’s attack on Glenn Midton, who was replaced, and after the game with the hand — were rejected.
"Ligingstone Hits a Analysis
Alladair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Toni Macaron Arena
The Fenomenal Game and the result of the "Livingstone"
Everyone to one played great, they continued to exceed the expectations of this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has not changed much after returning to the highest level, but they should give their dues to the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was playing great, he was very good at setting up a defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Warrela keep on the watch.
Rangers, however, did not have inspiration.
They played very well under Gerard’s direction before, but now they are far from reaching those standards.
They didn't have the last ball -- only once did they break up the Shady's defense of the fields -- and it was sort of waking up for the Rangers, which were in the middle of the table.
Erdogana was regularly taken to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, with a view to restoring the relationship between NATO’s allies.
Some of these conflicts arose over such issues as human rights, freedom of press, and the introduction of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The population is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police didn't let 25,000 people come to the mosque, but many of the president's supporters still appeared nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — among them a number of chickens — have also forced themselves to hear, and they condemn Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Two - sided protests testify to the ambiguity of a visitor, whom some German Turks called a hero and others a dictator.
An expensive accident in Djpford: A cyclist was killed in a car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car accident in London.
The accident took place at Beloud Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Destford region of a southeast city about 10:15 a.m. at the British standard time.
The car driver stopped, and paramedics came to the scene, but the man was killed.
This accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after leaving the driver’s accident site at Childrs Street, about six miles [1.6 km] from Saturday accident.
The London police reported that they were working on setting up a man to inform his immediate family.
The traffic is also banned, and bus routes have been changed, and motor vehicles are recommended to avoid this zone.
Six prison guards are injured in riots.
Six prison workers were injured by a riot in the men's maximum security prison, reported to the prison authorities.
Her Majesty Long-Laartin's imprisonment in Worcestershire began at around 09:30 at the British Standard Time on Sunday and is still going on.
In order to stem the disturbances initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special section of Tornado was called.
The officers were given medical attention in connection with the slight injuries of the face on the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: “For the solution of the incident in Her Majesty Long-Laartin prison, special trained prison personnel were involved.
Six employees received medical treatment in connection with trauma.
We don’t tolerate violence in our prisons and make clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and their prison term may be extended.”
In Her Majesty's Prison, there are more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June reported that the warden of the prison was sent to hospital treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a special police unit was summoned to prison to stop serious disturbances in which prison inmates were attacked with painful layers
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with heavy rains.
The clinical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but that can happen at the beginning of the next week, because the remnants of Hurricane Rosa are heading across the southwest of the desert, creating a risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of torrential floods on Monday and Tuesday from west Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southwest California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday and Monday on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones preserved the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane of some 40 miles (64.4 km) from Arizona.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Center of Hurricanes, in the Moullon-Rome region of Arizona, there are from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and in places up to 15.24 centimeters of rain.
Other parts of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Bassain, will probably get between 2.54 and 5.08 centimeters of rainfall, maybe up to 10.16 cm.
The rain of Rosa can be a blessing where torrential flooding is no more dangerous, since the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of them are likely to be useful because of drought.
According to the U.S. Centers for Drought Monitoring, a little over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers at least extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category, reportsweather.com.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa's journey leads to landslides on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rose, on Sunday morning, still in the grip of a hurricane at the maximum speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta-Evgenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19.3 kilometers per hour.
The storm is meeting with more cool water in the Pacific Ocean, and it's getting weaker.
Thus, it is expected that in the strength of a tropical storm, Monday afternoon will cause a landslide in Mexico.
The rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of floods.
“ The total rainfall from Lower California to northwest Sonora is expected to range from 7.62 to 15.24 centimeters, possibly 25.4 cm, ” reportsweather.com.
Then Rose would go north through Mexico like a tropical storm, get the Arizona border early in the morning, like tropical depression, which would go through Arizona, and late in the afternoon will get to South Utah.
“The total danger expected from Rose or her remains is severe rains in Nizhny California, Northwestern Sonori and southwest America, ” reports the National Hurricanes ’ Center.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life - threatening torrential flooding and refuse dumps in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attacks at Midsomer-Norton: Four men were arrested who attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old guy with a knife wound.
A wounded teenager was found in the Exelsior Terras region of Midsomer Norton at 004:00 a.m. for the British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radoka district, reported to the police to Aona and Somerset.
Police are asking anyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Tramp says that Cavano's "endurance and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The Voice for Judge Cavano is a voice against the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party, ” declared Tramp at Wiling, West Virginia.
Tramp said that Cavano had been “endurance and anger ” of the Democratic Party during the process of expansion.
Cavanaugh witnessed to Congress on Thursday, furiously and emotionallyly denying the charge that Christine Blazi Ford had committed sexual abuse on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed hearing her accusations.
On Saturday, the president declared that on that day, “the American people saw brilliantness, character, and courage. ”
“The after Judge Cavano is a vote for one of the most successful lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a sterling public service experience, ” he said to a crowd of adherents in West Virginia.
The president was quick to mention Cavanaugh's rise when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans' appearance in the Midstrom elections.
After five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will happen.
I don't run, but I'm really running, ” he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Tramp claimed that a democracy mission is to “oppose and interfere. ”
It's expected that the first major procedural vote in the Senate for candidate Cavano will take place not later on Friday, reported CNN as an assistant to one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people died from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of victims increased
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away in the ocean, when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, claiming the country’s authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting on a beach festival in the town of Pali on Friday, when waves of up to six meters (18 feet) in the twilight broke off the beach, killing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed the quake at 7.5 points.
“ When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach, and they didn’t immediately run away, and they were the victims, ” declared a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Ngorojo, a representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB).
“ It wasn’t just a tsunami, it moved cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land, ” said Ngorojo, adding that before hitting the coastline, tsunamis passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To save themselves from the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, adding.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
On aerial photography published by Disaster - Disposal Agency, many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges opened and destroyed, and mosques surrounded by water.
The post office in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
An Indonesian technology agency (BPPT) said that the energy released by a massive Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city at the end of a long, narrow harbor may have contributed to the tsunami’s intensity, reports the agency.
Nugorojo called the damage “widemasst ” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found buried in ruins of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 persons were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugorojo noted that victims and injuries may be more than 300 kilometers (190 miles) along the coast north of Palu in a region called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
“ Communications were completely damaged, and we didn’t get any information from Donggala, ” said Nugrojo.
More than 300,000 people live there, says the Red Cross statement, and it adds that its personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“ This is a tragedy, but it can become much bigger, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency was criticized for not stating that a tsunami struck Palm, although official officials said that waves had arrived at the time specified in advance.
The amateur footage that people share on social networks shows a man on the upper floor of the building crying a tremendous warning of a tsunami approaching on the street under a building.
After a few minutes, the water wall crashed into the beach, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't check the quality of the frames immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a serious disconnection of electricity, which broke off the bonds around Palau, which made it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Military officials began sending truckers from Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but evacuees still desperately needed food and other necessities.
The city airport was opened only to help, and it would be closed to October.
President Joko Widodo had to visit the evacuation centers in Palm on Sunday.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision's co-workers from Donggala safely reached the town of Pali, where they hide in the tarsiers set up in the courtyard of their office, but along the way they saw the scenes of devastation, said Mr. Doseb.
“ They told me they saw many houses destroyed, ” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups took decisive action to eliminate the effects of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Pali with much experience.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, delivery and delivery of personnel from abroad can only begin if disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That's not what happened.
“ This is still a disaster at the province level, ” noted Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can take international aid, but this status isn't met yet."
The night after the fiveth earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who had not yet been found still hoped that the arrival of their loved ones would be a miracle that would adorn these grim plots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken from the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescue workers received a woman lying under the stones for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendono Subando, a coach in Indonesia’s Paraplanerist National team, trained two missing paraplaners to participate in Asian games earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“ As a senior in paraplanerism, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon tells us that a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which had spread to the Paraplaners community, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp opponents of Palm who took part in the beach festival.
However, his report was marked by just one gray twig rather than with double blue ticks.
“ I think that means the message wasn’t delivered”, he said.
Swindlers took $26,750 to Newport on the left
Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from Breck, who ran a bank office in Newport on the Levee, reports a news report to the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptied the store in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarty on the news.
While he was busy, another man ‘ ran up behind to Binker's coworker ’ and stole a sack of money for the promotion.
The Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these people should turn to the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
The raper changes his name to E.
Reper Canier West changes his name to J.
On Saturday, announcing the change in Twitter, he wrote: “More officially known as Canie West. ”
The 41-year-old West was known for a while as J, and he used this contraction as a name for his album released in June.
The change happened the day before he showed up on the Saturday Night Live show, where he was supposed to present his new Yandhi album.
He replaces Arian Grande’s co-particist who cancels his show for emotional reasons, says the author of the show.
It's not just a contraction of the present professional name, West used to say that the word has religious significance for him.
“ I believe that "y" is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing the name of his album with a Big Boy radio.
So I'm you, I am us, it's us.
Canier, which means "one", was reduced to just "Y" -- it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
Album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanier is one of several famous rapers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Poff Deddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brothers Love.
A former colleague of Uesta, JAJI, also experimented with defys and capital letters.
President Andreas Manuel Lopez Orador of Mexico promises not to use an army against civilians
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andreas Manuel Lopez Orrador, promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the slaughter of the students.
On Saturday, Lopez Orrador, on Tellallolco Square, promised “never to use an army to suppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, and at that time, left student movements were beginning to begin all over Latin America.
Lopes Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidys to students and by opening up more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education have led youths to criminal organizations.
The U.S. needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
Because China is increasing its activity in artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount that they spend on research in this field, considers investors and practices in AI Kai-Fi Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after the different parts of the U.S. government made claims on AI, although the U.S. has no formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China has presented its plan last year: He wants to become number one in AI by 2030.
“The AI study budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are much behind the U.S., and we are preparing for another breakthrough in AI, ” said Lee.
The war of financing can double the probability that the next major AI achievement will be done in the U.S., said Lee in a CBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book The Nations of AI: China, Milicoon Valley, and the New World Order, was published this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the director general of the Sinovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he was working on an AI system that played the best American player at Otello, and later he was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google Chinese.
Lee pointed out a previous technology competition done by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Wallenge, for advanced defense research projects (DARPA), and asked when they were next to help identify future participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win state grants, said Lee.
“It doesn’t take academic leaders from China, it’s a corporation, ” he remarked.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies in recent years have engaged in lighting from AI universities.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policies can also help the U.S. to increase efforts in AI.
“I believe that Green Carton should automatically offer to AI candidates, ” he said.
The State Council of China has published its new generation’s artificial intelligence plan in July 2017.
The National Fund for Natural Sciences in China gives funding to people who work in academic institutions, just like the National Science Fund and other U.S. government organizations give money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Common Center of AI, which aims to involve partners from industry and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of a Special ICS Special Committee.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of two billion dollars at AI next.
In terms of the National Science Fund, he's now investing over 100 million dollars a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that wanted to create the National Intelligence Commission did not take any steps in a few months.
The Macedonians vote on a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia on Sunday voted on a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Northern Macedonia Republic, which would allow for a long - term dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia from membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and it is used to introduce Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalistic opposers of the treaty argue that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he wouldn't vote at a referendum, and because of a bout campaign, there's doubts as to whether at least 50 percent of electorals will reach, which will allow them to see the referendum as valid.
The question in the Bulletin of the Conference reads: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU if you agree to agree with the Greece agreement? ”
Supporters of the name, including the Prime Minister Zavév, say that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should be paid to enter such organs as the EU and Nato.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the European Union's eland, because it means a safer life for all of us, ” said 19 - year - old Oliver Georgievski, in Skopje.
Although the vote doesn't have legal obligations, the members of Parliament said that they would support it to make it decisive.
The name will require two-thirds of the votes in Parliament to change.
The National Council declared that prior to 3:00 p.m., there was no record of violations.
But it only made 16 percent of the 34 percent of the last Parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered votes were thrown into the womb.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," declared the 62-year-old voter Gose Tanevsky in the capital city of Skopier.
On September 30, 2018, in St.
Before Parliament at Skopier 54 years old, Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and set up chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head raised, not through a service door, ” said the Quardarkov.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration.”
The Prime Minister of Zayniy believes that membership in NATO will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment rates are over 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority votes for because more than 80% of our citizens are acting for the EU and NATO,” said the Yuan after voting.
He noted that the result of a “yes ” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute of Political Research, 30 to 43 percent of the voters will be participating in a referendum, below the need.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents are expected to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they'd vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be recognized as valid, it must be 50% plus one.
The failure at the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the incoming government from the beginning of his work last May.
See, Serhio Aguaro of Manchester City, through all of Breitton's defense and scores a goal.
Serhio Aguaro and Rahim Sterling have been championed by Breitton and have won the Manchester City victory with a score of 2-0 on Saturday at Etichade Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguaro's goal at 65 minutes looked like a funny simple match.
The Argentine attacker got a cut at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three of Breitton's defenders and ended up in the open field.
Then Aguro realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went around one defender, then ran around a few more at the edge of Breitton's fine.
Then he made a belt to the left, seeing Sterling.
The English trout made the first touch of the finer to hand over Aguro's ball, which had run it right into the gate by defeating the Breitton hollyper, Matthew Ryan.
“ Aguaro has some problems with legs, ” said the magazine manager Pep Gwardiola.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That is exactly what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at this moment.”
But the initial advantage of the sky-blue in this game of primes provided by Sterling.
This is a goal that took place in 29 minutes.
Aguaro got the ball deep in Breitton.
He sent a beautiful passing trail along the left flank of Lera Sae.
Leroy made some touchs and then made a pass of Sterling in the direction of the long pants.
The Forward of the Heavenly Blues dropped the ball into the gate just before it slipped out.

Sherzer wants to take back Raxis points.
Since the Washington Mornings team came out of the lobby, there was no real reason for us to wait for another start.
But instead of being competitive, Sherzer hopes to go out on a Saturday's Saturday in a game against Colodo Rox, assuming that Raxis is still going to have trouble getting on his way out to Leoxis, now a game in the National League of the West.
"Roxis" at least have wail-cad for winning five to two on a Friday evening, but still wants to secure the title of the first Division.
"In spite of what we're playing for, at least we'll be able to leave the ball, knowing how the audience behaves here in Denver, and another team will probably play at the highest level that I've seen over the course of the year.
Why don’t I want to get involved in this race?
The Daily News will announce who's going to be Sunday's starting pitter, but it's reported that they tend to be Sherzer.
Sherzer, for whom it's going to be the 34th start, and Thursday there's a series of sweating sessions, and he can play on Sunday, his usual day out.

Midgets Trump in West Virginia
The president was quick to mention the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brettt Cavano when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans in the Midstrom elections.
“ Everything we did will be a map in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will happen.
It’s one of the big, big ones — I’m not running, but I’m really running, so I’m fighting everywhere I can, for great candidates, ” he said.
Tramp went on to say: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, and you see that it's happening now.
And they're determined to return power, using any means, you can see the subduction, the trade.
They don’t care who is suffering them, who needs to go over to get power and control, they want power and control, we aren’t going to give them. ’ ”
The mission of democracy, he said, is to “oppose and interfere.”
“And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies ‘ angry and mean, disgusting and false. ’
He referred to the Senate Court Committee, calling it the Demographic Senator Diane Feynman by name, which prompted the audience to cry out in frustration.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you give the document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- this was really the bad language of the body - the worst body language I've ever seen. ’ ”
The Lebist Party is no longer a popular church.
It is untapped to those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, I was hardly surprised.
Eventually, I'm the last of the Parliament's directors to whom they're told that they're not welcome, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
Joan Ryan, a member of my Parliament, was treated almost similarly because of her strong stand against anti - Semitism.
I was sentenced to disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, these issues are ironicly similar to those of which Jeremy disagreeed with previous leaders.
A report on a meeting of the Nottingham East on Friday stated: “We want meetings to be inculatory and productive.”
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Lilibists were like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of “more kindly, more soft ” politicians has long been forgotten if it was ever done at all.
It's becoming increasingly clear that the Lebist Party doesn't have a different view, and each opinion is judged from the point of view of whether it's acceptable for the leadership of the party.
And this started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, the teams that I thought I had had a political outlook like this began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take a position that I would never agree with, whether national security or the only market in the EU.
Whenever I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- it's followed by a yead of raids on social networks, calls to revocation, condemnation of the center policy, they tell me I shouldn't be in the Lebist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I've been given are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face the flow of sexist or racist attacks every day, but they never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that standards of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin announced last week that the Leborist Party should cultivate a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and every move of "unbelieve" or changing the rules of selection narrows down.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been called on not to jump out, not to say things so loud that ‘ everything worked out well ’ with me.
But I didn't come to politics for that.
And I joined the Liborians 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because because because of the lack of attention from the government, Tetcher, my high school class literally collapsed, and since then I've been trying to improve the quality of public service for those who need it most, whether it's a local advisor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including my last election.
No one at Nottingham East has confused my political views and differences with current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday events, I just want to say one thing: when a country goes to Brexite, which is harmful to households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Lebist Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Nottingham, but for my voters, as members of the Leborist Party, and no: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no threat will cause me and no political benefit to act in accordance with what I consider the best interests of you all.

Ayer 38 - 17 "Melrows Call Untied Ayre" Going Up
The last two attempts may have distorted the final outcome, but no doubt the Eyre won the prize in today’s wonderful entertainment match in Premierspus.
Now they're taking over the table, and this is the only unbeatable team of ten.
After all, an excellent defense and improved ability to exploit the odds gives the host and trainer Peter Merchie the full right to be content.
“ Until we've been through the trials of our games, and we're still unconquerable, so I have to be happy, ” he said.
Robin Kristie, of the Melrouses, commented: “I give her "Eyr's due, they used better chances than we do."
The 14th - minute attempt of Grant Anderson, implemented by Fresier Clemo, brought Eyre forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, published by Urriors, allowed the Maelrouse to display figures, and Jason Boggo used an unrescripted attempt.
The Clemo increased Air Leadership by using a dorti and right before the break did and did a solo test that gave a 17-5 bill in favor of Eyre
But 'Melrouse' got a good second moment, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baghdad, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a delay due to the severe trauma of Ruridah Knotta, who had been taken out of the field on a stretch, and Eyre’s regres had broken forward with the attempt of Stafford Mcdaull, which was implemented by Clemo.
Captain Harer, Blair McFurson, had a yellow card then, and once again "Melrouse" forced another player to pay an unregulated attempt by Bruce Colwyn under intense pressure.
The Masters returned, but when Strauan Hutchinson got a yellow card for the recontambet Clemo without a ball from the finest line, Makferson made a tapdown in the back of an Ayr moth.
Klemo made an attempt to do what he did almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Row got a kick from David Armstrong in the box and sent a flanker to Gregor Henry for a fifth attempt by the host's team.
Looks like there's still a new career in the restaurant game star.
Looks like the star on The Still Game, Ford Keran, set up for a new career in hospitality, and that's the conclusion after it became known that he was the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor is playing Jack Jarvis in a popular BBBC television series where he writes a scenario where he's filmed with an old comedy partner, Greg Hamfield.
Duet announced that the future of the ninth series would be the last of the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning to live after Crejling.
According to the official record, he is the CEO of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the origin of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the “hauling restaurant business ” of Glazgo.
“ It is our dream that the interior Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors patrol an armed fleet headquarters in La Pas.
Public buildings hang ocean blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a motto: “Our turn is right.
We have to get him back."
In Bolivia, which has no entrance to the sea, there's still a memory of the loss of the coastline that's driven Chile into the bloody conflict of the 19th century through natural resources, and there's a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades because Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision on October 1 after five years of investigation.
“ Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and tranquillity and, of course, a positive outcome, ” commented Roberto Caladia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the MKI decision on large screens across the country, and they hope that a tribunal in Hague will make a decision in favor of Bolivia, that after decades of repeated conversation, Chile will be forced to negotiate for Bolivia a sovereign exit to sea.
Evo Moreáles, charismatic Native president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his reconnaissance in the following year, also has high hopes for a decision that will be announced on Monday.
“ We’re very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if that happens, it will change little.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to condemn Chile and has observed that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the MKI decision, which was made just six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case “was not difficult, ” said Pope Zarathe, a Chilean expert on international law.
Bolivia’s case has not advanced; the last four years may have contributed to a relapse.
“ Access to the sea was used by the present Bolivian administration, ” said Zarathe.
Maurels, a warlord, blew up remains of Chilean kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation at some point, but it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Weltze, of Bolivia in the Hague, did not agree that the ruling of the court was unusually rapid.
On Monday Bolivia will receive “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationship with Chile and to end 139 years of differences, ” he said.
Calasadesia also denied that Moreles — still another of Latin American most popular presidents — had used the moral issue as a political favor.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific, ” he added.
This determination is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind. ’ ”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ring Ho says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises uttered during the summit in Singapore by the leader of the Supper countries.
His comments appeared when the U.S. Department of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be on the verge of a rescinding of nuclear diplomacy, which went to a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen In.
Ríy says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and the United States’s declarations of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is a “unfulful dream. ”
Washington, D.C., is afraid to make a declaration before the Pilgrims take major steps to disarmament.
Kim and U.S. president Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a widespread skepticism that Phanyan takes seriously the refusal of his arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to secure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phanyan next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Tramp.
The Paris fashion shows presented the last trend of massive major councils that are already heading on the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or hide completely from the sun, you've found the right thing to do.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of extra-centralistic high-class rounds in the spring and summer collection of 2019 on the scale of a brilliant Paris week of fashion.
Very impractical hats caught Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their dizzying creations beyond the podium.
Valentino isolated himself with an exclusive bead hat with wide decorated feathers covering the fields that covered the heads of the model.
Among the other parasolists are the precious stones of the watermelon, the sorcerer's hat and even the pineapple hat, but they're not to keep the head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the order of the original masks — just in time for Hebron.
Many of these colorful masks had stitched lips and were more like Hannibal Leketer than high - tech models.
One creature was like an instrument for underwater swimming with tubes and glasses, and the other was like a frozen freezer.
And if you support this serious fashion statement, you're lucky.
Steelists say that giant hats can go to the main streets of your city.
Oversaise coughing went into fashion thanks to the Lea Bombi, a straw hat with a six - inch - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide - wide view from Rianne to Emily Ratagekski.
A brand that's behind a very impractical hat that's seen everywhere on social networks has given peace to another creature: a straw beach bag about the size of a model in a bathing suit.
The yellow-red billy bag with a bacillus bacillus and a white leather handle was the central element of La Riviira's collection of spring and summer 2019 brand Jacquemus at the Paris week of fashion.
“ On the next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the designer’s influence is so great that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for a sovereign. ”
John Edward: knowledge of language is mandatory for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland support high standards of learning, and in 2018 they again received excellent results of exams that complement individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which teach over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are presented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (U.S.S.A.), and they are eager to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for the future and higher education that they have chosen to pursue and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement a personal school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that she understands, she perceives it in her mind.
If you speak to her in her own language, she will perceive it in her heart.”
It's a powerful reminder that we can't only use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year's exams, we find that in independent schools, language is highly rated in the highest grades.
Altogether, 68 percent of those who studied foreign languages got a higher A.
Data collected in 74 U.S. schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher score from Chinese, and 72 percent of those who study German, 69 percent of those who study French, and 63 percent of those who study Spanish, also got A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital subjects that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now language as a choice subject is presented in the same way as NAM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), in terms of independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Jobs and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17 percent of the reasons that employers can't shut down vacanations that involve language deficiency.
So language skills are becoming more and more essential in preparing young people for future careers.
As more and more promising positions require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career you choose, if someone learned a second language, they're going to have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives one who has several languages the advantage over competitors.
According to a 2013 survey of over 4,000 U.K. adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by ambiguous percentage of people (15%).
That's why the investment in language teaching is now important for kids today.
Learning several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a full - time job.
In Scotland, languages will be learned in every school.
A row of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always select several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scottish Independent Schools try to create a educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now we can't deny that in the international business media language is still vital to the future of the country, so it should be shown in education.
Modern languages must really be considered “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, variety, and perfection for Scottish youths.
I'll give it to you once there's fire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Liebron debuts Lequekers in San Diego.
The fans who want to see the first launch of Lobrona James for Los Angeles Lakers have almost arrived.
Luke Walton's trainer announced that James would be playing Sunday at the first pre-sation match against Dever Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play, he's not done yet.
“ It will be more than one and less than 48”, said Walton on the official Leakers website.
Leakers Reporter Mike Trudwell reported that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games in the Lekers Presand.
“ At this stage in my training career, I don’t need presandons, ” he replied.
Trampins in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today starts a series of pre-election rallys from Weling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planning states for the next week of the Trampa rallys, including the rallyings in friendlyly configured states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidate proposed by him to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Tramp wants to form support for future middle-term elections, because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What is the hour of today's Trump meeting in West Virginia, and how do we look at it on the Internet?
Moon Tremp in Hueling, West Virginia, scheduled 19 hours east of today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Tramp's rally in West Virginia online on direct YouTube.
Trampe is likely to remember the intense hearings that took place this week about a candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano, who is accused of sexual harassment, and of delaying the vote of the Senate for a week while the FBI is under investigation.
But the main goal of this series of rallys is to help Republicans with the introduction to elections in November.
President Trump said that these five protests are aimed at “activizing volunteers and supporters in the next week, because the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand most of the people they have in the Senate and the Palace of Reuters.”
“ Congress’s control is so critical for its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, because there’s an increasingly intense campaign season coming, ” said Reuters, a spokesman for the Trump campaign who would not want to call his name.
At a meeting planned at the Vesbanko Arena, in the city of Huiging today’s rally, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Mutro News.
Saturday's visit will be the second in the last month of Trampa's visit to West Virginia, where he's dialed over 40% of the vote in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morcisy, who is considered to be behind surveys.
“ It’s not good for Morcisy that the president is coming to raise his rating in surveys, ” commented Reuters Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cube 2018: U.S. team set up for battle and full of hopes before Sunday bruises
After three sessions that ended in a one - sided victory, the afternoon Sabbath trouts could be exactly what Ryder lacked.
A powerful pulse pendulum is a fully invented sports concept that players really believe in, especially in similar competitions.
So when they say that the pulse works?
“ They were in front of six points, and now they're four points, so I think we're taking it a little bit like an impulse, ” said Jordan Spiet as we walked in.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, says Speth, feel a little wind in their sails, and a lot of them encourage, not the least, the shape of Speta and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each made three points out of four.
The spin with his killer blows from the little guy to the grin shows an example.
These guttural cries of celebration became louder when, as he continued his round, he made a crucial trap and leveled the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas had held back for two points.
His hood, which allowed them to win a 15-walk match, met with a similar scream, such as that which tells you that the American team doesn't give up.
“You really just have to put forth a lot of effort and worry about your own match, ” said Speth.
That's all each of these players left right now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Speth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitzwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but fascinating couple in Europe have four in four, and they cannot be mistaken.
The Moliwood was the only couple who didn't make a boygi on Saturday afternoon, and they managed to avoid the boygi early on Saturday mornings and afternoons on Friday and nine last meadows on Friday morning.
This race and how their energy seems to flow to this raging crowd and back and forth, makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will no longer be popular players, except Fleetwood or Molinari, to reinforce the potential victory of Europeans when the sun comes over Le Golf National.
You both sit on different holes at the same time.
However, speaking of the triumph of Europeans before it is too early.
Boubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it to Sergio Harcia, the hero of the morning trout when he was together with Alex Noreen.
One boygie and two miles in the first nine holes brought a Spaniard and a swede to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to see forbs and trouts close by the interaction between couples, through the advice they give, the advice they're not giving, and also interesting to watch how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe is currently playing better as a team and has a great advantage on the last day, but this trout session has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight what some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe is winning at a score of 10 to 6 on the last day of Cuba Ryder.
On the final day of Cuba, the Ryder Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday services and services, it's ahead of the United States with a score of 10 to 6.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitzwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the remaining Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to return the trophies they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American morning services with an account of 3-1.
The U.S. was more resistant in trout and won two games, but they failed to cut the gap.
Jim Furick's team will need eight points in 12 Sunday bruises to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood, the first European novice to take four points in a row, and he and Mollinari (and Molliwood), after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple, who scored four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cube.
When they smashed Woods and Patrick Reed's up in the fork, they joined themselves to win the Woods jerk and the American-Americanist Briisson Deschembo with an even more spectacular 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled out two weekends, demonstrated random bursts of genius, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in trombos and trouts and seven rounds.
Justin Rose, who didn't participate in morning services, went back to Henry Stanson's partner in troms to fail with a score of 2ta1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coek, who are the first and third of the world's ratings.
Europe couldn't do everything in its own way this nice, fresh day on the southwest side of Paris.
Three times the chief winner, Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, set the standard on Saturday for Americans with two points.
They gained a decisive victory of 2ta1 over the Spanishs John Ram and Ian Poulter in trout and later defeated Poulter and Rory McAlroy with a score of 4th and 3 in trouts, losing two first holes.
Only twice in the history of Cuba Ryder's team returned with a four-point deficit, though Frick's team needs only a draw.
However, after the second place for two days, the counter attack on Sunday looks as if it were beyond their power.
North Korea says no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
The North Korean Foreign Minister on Saturday reported to the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions is increasing mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country will never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Rong Ho told the United Nations General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea had taken “survival measures of good will” such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, disposing of a nuclear testing site and commitment not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a proper reaction from the U.S.”, he said.
“Without confidence in the U.S. National Security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to arm in one - sided order.”
And while Ree repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance to denoglarization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its progress, his statement proved to be important to the fact that it did not reject the one-way deucalization that made Pyenha in the past.
Rein referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Ian and Donald Trump on the first of history between the real president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called on “denucularization of the Korean Peninsula, ” and Trump promised the security guarantee of North Korea.
North Korea wants the formal end of the Korean War of 1950-2053, but the United States said that the Pujans had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resists strong international sanctions against North Korea.
“ U.S.A. insists on ‘ postuclelarization at first ’ and increases pressure by resorting to sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even denying the ‘ announcement of the end of war, ’ ” said Ree.
“ To think that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases our skepticism.”
Ree did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which U.S. leader stressed in the United States at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister called attention to three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moone during the last five months and added: “If the side of denoglarization were to be South Korea, not the United States, the denocleralization of the Korean peninsula would not have entered such a dead corner. ”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ree was quite different from last year when he told the General Assembly that aiming North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after "Mister the Evil President" Trump called Kim the "rape People" who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, at UN Tramp, who threatened to “complete ” North Korea last year, he praised Kim for the courage to take advantage of disarmament, but said that much more would be needed, and the sanctions must remain in force to denoglarize North Korea.
Wednesday Tramp noted that he does not set a time limit for this: “It takes two years, three years or five months to complete, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say that the United Nations Security Council is going to reward Pyongs for taking steps.
However, U.S. secretary Mike Pompeo stated on Thursday that the UN Security Council “should continue energetically and steadily until we see the complete, final, confirmed denoglarization. ”
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an effort to block the financing of nuclear programs and PCBs.
Pompeo met Ree in the United Nations General Assembly and then said that the following month he would visit Pyongian again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongang in July and commented that progress had been made, but within a few hours, North Korea condemned him for “gangsterial demands. ”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to take apart a rocket complex as well as a nuclear complex if the United States would take action.”
He told us that Kim needed “responsive measures ” to ensure that Tramp promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington, D.C.
Harvard students are taking courses on how to get enough rest
The new Harvard University course in this year has given all of his students more sleep, and it's an effort to fight a growing culture of cool learning the whole night after having caffeine.
The instructor found that university students number one in the world are often ignorant when it comes to the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Chaesler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigam Hospital, developed a course that he felt was the first in the United States.
He decided to start a course after giving the lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, one girl approached him and said: “Why should I be told this now, last year? ”
“ She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep that surprised me, ” explained the teacher in The Telegraph.
For the first time introduced this year, students explain the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and athletic results as well as improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the university, explained that the university decided to enter a course after it was discovered that students were seriously deprived of sleep within a week.
Hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one chapter, we have images of a room in a dorm room where students click cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficits on sports performances, and the importance of routines related to sleep.
Another chapter tells how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
And then a map of a campus with interactive icons encourages people to think about their daily routine.
“ We know this doesn’t change the behavior of students instantly.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the consequences of smoking cigarettes for your health,” added Professor Chaesler.
The culture of pride for “sustaining all night ” still exists, added, and noted that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is growing.
A good - quality sleep should be a ‘ secret weapon ’ of a student to cope with stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, even with a lack of weight, since sleep deprivation causes his brain to go to a state of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he explained.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who was studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler to develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to approach all the graduate students to ask for a similar training program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chaesler recommends that students put on reminders that they go to bed, put on alarm clocks, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, and can disrupt a circular rhythm that causes sleep problems.
Riverston 1 - 0 "Reingers fingered the Mengae's boys down.
Rangers suffered another attack of evading sorrow: Dolly Mengae’s defeat brought a defeat to Stephen Gerard’s distinguished team with a score of 1-0 from the Lavingston.
The Aybrox team wanted to win its first victory in an exit match after the fierce triumph of Saint - Johnston, with a score of 4-1, but Gary Holt's team defeated Jared with a second defeat as a manager of 18 games. The Gerard team remained eight points behind the leaders of the Scottish Premier's Haarts.
Menga took seven minutes to the break, and the teners, lacking inspiration, did not look as if the score could be leveled.
The Rangers are now down to the sixth position, and the Lawingston is now up to the third, and only Hibernian is above the ball difference.
Moreover, the Rangers may experience another unpleasant experience, since the lineman Kalum Spence had to cultivate the wound of his head after having been thrown into a guest section.
He made eight changes in a team that once passed Ayre in the semifinal Cube of the Scottish League.
And Holt released the same composition of Lava 11 that took one point at Harts last week, and he was thrilled to see his forced boys oppressing the rivals at every turn.
Reingers may have been dominated by the ball, but "Lewingston" worked harder with the ball they received.
They were supposed to kill in just two minutes when the first range of Mengas in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gates of Allan McGorg, but the half-protector had wasted that great chance by sending the ball near the gate.
Kagahan Jacobs' deep free punch came from Craig Holkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, hit the back of his pants.
The Rangers really got control, but at the last third there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should get the status of the mallet on a quarter of an hour after impact with Stephen Louless, but the referee Steven Thomson declined the call of the colobulator.
The Rangers managed to make only two punches at the gate in the first taim, but the former Aybrox gatekeeper, Lima Kelley, struck Lassan Kulibari and quietly struck Ovivier Edgeria with little care.
And while the knife of the "Livingstone" for 34 minutes may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it only by their hard work.
Rangers failed again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Meng for a simple conclusion.
During the break, Gerard replaced Kulibala with Ryan Kent, and this change almost worked as he went to Morelos, but the amazing Kelley used his line to lock him down.
However, the Riverston continued to force visitors to play the same game that they enjoy when Litgo and Halkett make one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved the results in the last stages, but McGruger had a good fight against Jacobs before Litgo hit the corner.
Glenn Midton, replaced by the Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson looked back.
Almanach: inventor of Geiger's counter
Now, on September 30, 1882, the Sunday Morning, 136 years ago, and on that day,... a future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's licuers have become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of popular culture, such as in the 1950 film The Bell of Coronado with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play a rather questionable view of cowboys.
Man: “What is it? ”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can really hear the effects of radioactivity atoms in minerals.”
Evans: “Well, it’s breaking right now! ”
He died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see ” malignant cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, which are part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can see a protein that is common to many types of cancers, and then they put the patient back in.
A test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells lost ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can see together for many types of protein cancer (HER2), and reentering those cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Betesda, Maryland, observed: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
"HER2" is causing several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and heart cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells from patients and learning, to target cancer cells has worked to treat one type of leukemia.
After the SNL show appeared in the studio, in an MAGA Kanje West issued a sharp speech to support President Trump,
I don't know what caused the audience's negative reaction.
The audience at the SNL show (Four Night on Live air) was enlightened by Kanie after his sad performance, during which he praised Donald Trump and announced that he would be on duty for the presidency in 2020.
After performing the third song, called the Ghost Ghost, in a baseball with the words "Let's Return America to a Former Glory", he broke up with a meeting in which he opened up democracies, and again declared his support for Tramp.
"Sometimes during a conversation, white people ask me, "How do you like Tramp? He's a racist."
Well, if I had been disturbed by racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
The SNL started with Matt Damon's badge where the Hollywood star ridiculed the testimony of Bretta Kavano, which he gave to the Legal Committee of the Senate in the case of Christine Bleizie Ford of Sexual Violence.
Although West's speech was not broadcast on direct air, the video with his T-shirt put in a social network of commission Chris Rock.
It's still unclear whether Rock wanted to mock West by placing this post.
West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes there was an unpleasant situation because of his head covering.
As reported by the Washington Examiner, the West said, "When I was behind the scenes, I was rudely treated.
I was told, “Don’t go out to the audience in this baseball. ”
They were making fun of me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed keep quiet."
The West went on to say, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the Wariety weekly, his comments at least twice caused the audience's negative reaction in the hall, and the performance actors of the SNL looked confused, and one of the audience said, "There was a dead silence in the studio."
The West was at the last minute invited to replace Arian Grande, whose former boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days before the air.
The West has caused many to wonder, after listening to the song of I Love It (I love it) in a Perrier bottle of water.
The West supported the head of the conservative organization of PUSA Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the boldest:
Instead, she wrote on Twitter to the top show that West is what he is, and that's just great.
"Well, I won't reward him by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his art," who I think is practicing and excreting a ideology that is damaging to my community.
He's a free man.
So did we," she added.
In front of the show, the alien announced on Twitter what had changed his name: he's now "the one who had been known as Cievi West."
West isn't the first artist to change his name, and he's following the example of Diddy, also known as Puffeddy, Puffy, and P.D.
Colleaper Snoop Dong had been called Snoop Lyons before, and as we know, Prince's musical legend of the last few decades changed the name into a symbol, and then became Artistist, formerly known as Prince.
Accused of deliberate murder after an assault with a knife at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after committing a knife wound to another man in an Oriental Belfast restaurant on Friday.

The prosecutor's looking at the charge.
The movie of "Gra of the thrones" by Keith Herington condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Guerton became famous for his role as a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval festival of HBO production.
However, a 31-year-old performance actor with the condemnation of a macho hero's stereotype, saying that because of such heroes on screen, young men often seem to have to be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit claimed "something went wrong," and he asked how to solve the problem of idealization of brutality in the era of hashtag #MeTo (#YAI, NOEZEZ, etc.).
Keith, who recently married a friend of his "Gri thrones," 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, pointed out that he was "good enough" to deal with this problem.
"I'm pretty determined at the moment, when we're on the slippery path of the idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if you look at their growing up because of the nature of the problem we see now?"
The cat believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality through images of very courageous heroes.
He went on to say, "What is natural, what do we get?
Why does television and street music teach that young boys feel pressure to be such?
I think today is a really important question, ‘ How can we change this? ’
Because it's obvious that young boys have gone astray."
In an interview, he also pointed out that he would not be filmed in any travails and casts of "Gri thrones" after the show ended the next summer, because "he had already finished fighting and horses."
From November, Kit will play in the production of Sam Sheparda's "The Right West" play stories about a movie producer and his citizen brother.
As an actor recently confessed, he considers meeting with his wife, Rose, the best thing he's ever done with the "Gra of the thrones."
"When I was filming this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and assigned me a life to live," said Keith.
In a fantasy show that got the awards "Emmie," Rose played Igritt, the love of Gerington Jon Snow.
The couple were in June 2018, and the ceremony was held in the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HlV/AlDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases of disease
China reported a 14 - percent increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, there are a total of more than 80,000 patients in the country.
In 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported in 2018.
In most cases the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in previous trends.
For a long time, HIV was widely distributed in some parts of China through blood transfusions.
However, according to official health officials at a conference held in the province of Junnan, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
Yet, compared with the previous year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has grown to 100,000.
Transmitting HIV through sex over time is a serious problem for Chinese LHBT communities.
The decrying of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to the study, 70-90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men are still marrying women because of the prevailing values in the country.
In most cases the transmission of disease is due to improper use of protection in sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs in part to solve the problem.
Maxine Watts denies the release of public senators into the network by a public worker who's criticizing "unsafe lie" and "the theory of conspiracy."
On Saturday, a member of the House of Representatives of the United States, Maxine Waters, denounced the loud statement that one of its staff posted personal information to three U.S. senators on their Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles democrat says that these statements are spread by political reviews and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and then an even more disgusting lie," said Watts on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information contained home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrena Hatcha of Utah.
The data came on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person with Capitol during the hearings of the Senate Commission on charges of sexual offenses against Bretta Kavano, a candidate for the Supreme Court of the United States.
The leaking occurred some time after three senators interrogated Cavano.
The Herald reported that on conservative websites like the Getaway Pundit and RedSte, there was information that the IP address of the source had been linked to the University Office and was able to find data from her public colleague.
"These groundless statements are absolutely not true, they are not true," continued Watts.
"The part-worker of my office, whose personal data and security are being threatened by these false and false claims, has nothing to do with the source of this information.
These unfounded statements are absolutely not true, they are not true."
Waters was quickly opened up on the network, and a former secret press in the White House of Arie Fleischer said so.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that, with that disposition, she can't be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he did not do, there is no need to become angry.
The one accused should not act presumptuously.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He should stay calm and uninhibited."
It seems that Fleischer was conducting parallels between Waters ’ reaction and the criticism of democracies at the address of Judge Cavano, who was accused of being too angry at hearings on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to take his place at the results of intermediate elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's so news, if it's true," he wrote.
Whichers said her office has already reported "representative state authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false claims."
"We will do all we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered before the law for their actions which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of "Agent Johnny Ingish: A New Mission" – Passing Parodysion for Roven Atkinson
Now, it's a good tradition to look in every new British film for Brexit, and there's a new series of comedians for Johnny Inglisz, the first film called "Jonny Ingish" to go on screen in 2003, and then the series was renewed in 2011, recreating "Johnnie Ingish: Re-launch."
Will there be a laughing, ironic self-sustaining self-sustaining thing that we don't understand, the new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Inglisz and his busy face and his eyes were once again able to make a mess, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comical character was designed for viewers in non-engaged countries.
Johnny is known to be a cheerful secret agent, in which, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, there is a little bit from Mr. Bina's inspector, a little bit from Mr. Bean and a lot of things, from the guy who played a note of tunes from the movie "Wound Mobs" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
An illustration of a character is also the traveller and mystery of an international scale, which has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in the long - forgotten television commercials of Barclayard.
In the last movie about Johnny Ingleisch, there are some nice moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglesch in knights ’ armor was approaching the helicopter and the screws were blowing against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent is well exposed to the film, but the humor of the prod is too much, and in some cases it's too much, especially when compared to the "serious" moviemakers, such as "Agent 007" and "Messsion Not Possible," and one of the teenagers who is also a comedy.
It seems that jokes are designed for children rather than adults, and I find the ridiculous attacks that happen to Johnny Ingleschem not as ingenious and thoughtful as the Atkinson dogmas in silent Binn movies.
As always, the film begins with Britain being threatened.
In the British supersecular network of spies, hacker opens the names of all field agents, which is a surprise to an active agent (for good reason, Kevin Eldon played only a scene in the film).
This turned out to be the last drop for the prime minister, the proud man who has already suffered severe criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity.
Reconnaissance advisers informed her that all active agents are compromised and should be brought in by a retired agent.
The choice falls on awkward Johnny Inglisz, who now works as a teacher at some super-sustainable institution, and has unofficially trained children to work under cover - up (in this part of the spying "slack of the Year" for teenagers there were several good jokes).
The Inglesha is quickly taken to Whitehol for emergency briefing, where he meets again with his long - suffering friend Baff, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine captain (the role of an existential person does not exactly match the talent of Vicki Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty goes to the table, "Betman and Robin" comes back in formation and suddenly confronts the fatal woman Ophelia Pistholov, who is playing Olga Kurzylenko.
And during this time, the prime minister comes under the charm of the charismatic billionaire who's made his fortune in technology and technology and says he can solve the problem with the British network, which Jake Lacey played.
Ingishish and Buff are going on a journey and they're going back to their ridiculous trick: they're wearing waiters, they're doing a fire in a fancy French restaurant; they're sowing chaos, and they're going out illegally on the side of the luxurious Volta boat; the Inglidish is doing a real mess as he's trying to use the helmet of virtual reality to get familiar with the planning of the Volta house.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but its kindness and violence remind us of a movie for children.
It's a commercial film.
As I watched other movies about Johnny Ingleisch, I asked myself the same question: Could not the British movie industry offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Leybourists deny the preparation of a plan by which the British will work four days a week, but they will get paid in five days.
The Leybos Party, Jeremy Corbinna, has to discuss a radical plan in which the British are going to work four days a week, but they're going to get paid for five days.
It's said that the party wants to have executives hand over funds saved as a result of an artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra output.
In this way, the workers will have three days off and bring home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea corresponds to the economic program of the party and directs the country’s resources to support the working class.
Moving to the four-day workweek was approved at the British Congress of Third Juniors, and it's estimated that this will allow workers to benefit from the changes in the global economic situation.
The source of the Lebist Party reported The Sunday Times as saying, "The policy view will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not going to change overnight, but the idea of a four-day work week corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers and also to the general industrial strategy of the party."
It wasn't the first to approve this idea, because the Green Party promised to bring in a four-day workweek during the 2017 campaign.
However, not all members of the Lebist Party now approve of such a desire.
Spiker of the Lebist Party said, "The political program of the party doesn't allow for a four-day workweek, so we're not looking at this idea right now."
"The Shadow's chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election meeting of the Lebist Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell claimed that he was willing to take power back from the "no-named directors" of communal enterprises and the "consistents."
The "Tin's" plan also means that the shareholders of the water supply may not get all their fortune if the Liborist government sets up an estimate on the basis of supposed violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include workers in company administration and to create innovative accretion funds to hand over 10% of the ordinary private sector firms waiting for an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy report 60 Minutes (60 minutes) on a show, or maybe an investigation of Kawano's case by the FBI can change their opinion
In connection with the investigation of the prosecutors against Judge Bretta Cavano, the final vote for his appointment of the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week, and the question is whether or not the senators will continue to support Cavano after publishing the results of his investigation.
On a Sunday show, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelli asked John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham senators if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During my hearings, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavano.
I called him after everything had happened and the charges came out, and I asked him, “Did you really do this? ”
He was firm, firm, uncompromising."
Graham's mind seems to change nothing anymore.
"I believe that Cawano's prosecution is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," added Graham, addressing Christine Blazi Ford.
And anyone she calls it cannot confirm it under an oath.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't know what can change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect the decrease in poverty?
On this Saturday New York festival, we'll take the Global Catholic Festival Festival festival, which is an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star artists and a equally dramatic mission to combat poverty worldwide.
During the seventh festival, Global Citizen Festival tens of thousands of people will throng at the Great Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the true goal of the festival, the organizers are eager to combat the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Festival Festival of 2012 is a continuation of Global Perception Project, an international community organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay the VIP points), visitors have to do a bunch of tasks, or actions, as they learn from a volunteer project, write an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or whatever else to help draw attention to the goals of the organization, eliminate poverty.
So, is there any results, because it's been 12 years for the Global Citizen organizers to achieve their goal?
Is it really another case of so-called "clicivientism" when people feel that they are really changing something by signing an electronic petition or making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 they have recorded 19 million "acts" of their adherents to achieve different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to report planned financial assessations and programs worth more than $337 billion, which will help to change lives by the year 2030 more than 2.25 billion people.
Early in 2018, the group cited 390 financial commitments and public statements, at least 10 billion already being collected and spent.
Some 649 million people around the world are estimated to have been directly affected by the funds provided.
One of the main financial commitments is The Power of Nutrition, which is geographically relevant to the U.K., and within the project, investors and realists took on the commitment to help children grow up, and they promised to give Rwanda $35 million to cope with malnutrition after they received over 4700 messages in Twitter from Global Cities.
"In support of the government of Great Britain, Mexico, governments of other countries and citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a small fact of history," said the representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Willman in front of the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
It also stated that after 5,000 "works" to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the U.K. government has announced a fund-responsion for the project The Power of Nature to improve the diet of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can solve the extreme poverty?"
And they said, "It's a long and difficult way, so sometimes we'll fall down and fail.
But like the civil rights movement and the apartheid movement against us, we're going to be successful because together we're stronger."
Janet Jackson, Group The Week, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Janelle Mona, is just a part of the star performers that are going to be at the Festival in New York this year, and they're going to lead him to Deborah-Lae Fernes and Gou Jackman.
Minister of Internal Affairs has declared that the U.S. can use naval power to prevent exports of Russian energy.
According to a quote by U.S. secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, quoted at Washington Examiner, could seek help from the military to prevent the exit of Russian energy markets, including Middle East markets.
Zenke claimed that Russian participation in a conflict in Syria, especially where it is at the invitation of a legitimate government, was a reason to explore new energy markets.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to mediate energy trade, as they do in Eastern and southern Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"The U.S. naval forces can provide free passage by sea routes and, if necessary, block them from entering the market," he said.
Intrigued, which was done by the Consumer Energy Allegance, a non-profit organization that looked to itself as "the vote of every consumer" in the United States.
He then compared approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, saying that they are actually similar.
"Economical strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy and replace it with alternative energy," he said, calling Russia "one-sided" because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these claims were being made, the Trampa administration set the goal of exporting compressed natural gas to Europe by replacing the energy market with the Russian energy industry with a much cheaper version for Europeans.
To that end, President Donald Trump and himself try to persuade the German government to abandon the "unprecedented" project of building the Air Flow 2 which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a hostage in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream 2 gas, which costs $11 billion and that will double the bandwidth of existing gas to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington is hot against the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"In my opinion, we share the idea that the energy sources can't be a tool of pressure and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after meeting the U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry, who was in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization for the Federal Union of German Industry (BDI) called on the U.S. not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and two-way agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when the third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Campf, chairman of the Federal Union of the German industry, after the last meeting of the German chancellor, Merkel's Angels with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, is thinking seriously about the president's bet in 2020.
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, declared on Saturday that he'd seriously think about beating the president's post after the middle election.
During a meeting with the public in Holik, Massachusetts, Warren testified that she was considering her potential for promotion.
As The Hill Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and get the government to work, and for that to be the woman in his head."
"After November 6th, I will think seriously about exterminating my candidate for presidential post."
During a meeting with Warren, he expressed his opinion of Donald Trump’s presidency, stating that he would "bring his country in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, critical of Trampa and a candidate for the Supreme Court’s office, Bretta Cavanaugh.
Warren wrote in his Friday Twitter, "...to be sure, the FBI has to do an investigation before the vote."
But according to a survey published on Friday, most of Warren's voters don't think it should be run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Suffol University Center for Political Studies and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential Massachusetts voters spoke out against the promotion of a senator of their candidate.
Thirty-two percent supported desalination.
The results showed that the former governor, Delval Patrick, was more supportive, with a possible promotion of him to the President's post, was 38%, against 48%.
During a discussion of the candidates for other well-known democracies, who can run around in 2020, they are also called former vice president Joe Byden and senator from Vermont Bernari Sanders.
According to Asocated Press, Bayden claimed that he would make a decision before January.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD Trek Palin during a campaign to support Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after he joined the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through now is that he's going to come back and understand only other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are coming home with," she stated in front of the pollutant to support Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
She called Trek's arrest "a problem nobody's paying attention" and said her son and other veterans of war "will return home not as they used to be, more violent, and want to know if they respect what their fellow soldiers, pilots and other military servants did to this country."
Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as with preventing reports of violence and carrying weapons in the state of alcohol.
18 States and District Columbia advocate asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia support a new U.S. policy report stating that victims of gang persecution and domestic violence are denied status as refugees.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts sent an analyst’s note to Washington, D.C.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grays v. Seshins case for the U.S. Civil Rights Union’s suit of complaint against Federal Policy, which was issued in August, is not revealed.
She claimed that her partner, "and his savage son," beat her, but the U.S. government refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20.
She was illegally held in Texas.
The government prosecutors who support Grace’s suit of lawsuits claimed that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala (the refugees from whom often seek asylum in the United States) often face serious problems, such as gang violence and domestic violence.
A new refugee’s status policy differs from the appeal Council’s decision on immigration in 2014, which allowed immigrants to flee from domestic violence to request asylum.
General attorney general of the District of Columbia General Karl Reysin declared on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state laws, federal and international laws."
"The Federal Law requires that decisions on whether a refugee's status statement is based on the facts and circumstances of that statement, and the prohibition violates that principle," is in the analic record of a court consultant.
Then in an analytic note, the prosecutors argue that policies that ban immigrants from entry in the United States are damaging to the economy because they potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labor resources."
In June, attorney general Jeff Sechns decreed that immigration judges should no longer be allowed to be refugees by fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"It is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, faith, nationality, membership in certain social groups or political views," said Sishns in his policy presentation on June 11.
The provision of shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
The rescuers are desperate to find the survivors, while the number of casualties in Palm has doubled.
For those who have survived, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the ruined city of Pamu.
"Every minute of an ambulance brings in the body.
There's not enough clean water."
Some residents return to their homes in ruins, taking up submersible belongings, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake with 7.5 points on Richter’s scale are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including two Geris, with back fractures and shoulder fractures, rest near the building of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are given help under the open air through constant repeated tremors.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled how a violent shock shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for rescue.
"I think I'm trapped in the debris of the wall," said Heis's reporter Assoculated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife begging for help, and then held the silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador blames China for "consumption of psychological pressure" with "prologue of propaganda."
A week after the State Chinese newspaper placed on four pages of the American daily edition of advertising mutual benefits from trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Tramp of the last Wednesday referred to the payment app of the Christa Daily in Des Mountain Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa after blaming China for an attempt to influence the election to Congress that will happen on November 6th, and China rejects these charges.
As reported by Reuters officials in the United States, Tramp’s claims that he charges Beijing with attempted American interventions mean a new stage of escalation from Washington, whose purpose is to pressure to China.
Although foreign governments can post ads to increase trade, there is an escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, D.C., in which they have already raised the customs to import.
The experts in China and the United States believe that at the beginning of this war, repressive customs in China were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa who supported the Republic Party of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that China was doing harm to American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in a Sunday release column of Des Moines Register, "is increasing the pressure by publishing propaganda advertising in our independent press."
"For the spread of propaganda, the Chinese government is using the tradition of freedom of speech and independence press for the American people, placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"In contrast, in the street schedules here in Beijing, you find only individual voices of dissidents, and you don't see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is a concern, which suggests that China's media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also said that "one of the respected Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but he didn't say which one.
Analysts warn that the failure with the Cavano Republicans is being set up against themselves by women who are elected before the middle elections.
Since many prominent Republicans support and protect the candidate for the Supreme Court Justice Brettt Cawano after several sexual harassment charges have been made, analysts warn that this may trigger an undesirable reaction prior to future intermediate elections, especially for women.
All around this situation there's passion, and most Republicans are publicly saying they'd like to go to vote.
And then you can't just play back," said The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Riger, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University.
Ryger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, where, at the last minute, senator Jeff Flyck, a republic of Arizona, would be sufficient to calm angry voters.
Catherine Jean-Perier on Friday said, "Women won't forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning the protesters sang "The Battle Is Coming!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move on to the endorsement of Cavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
In an interview with the new website, Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political viewer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They're saying it's true now, and it's true.
However, motivation can intensify, especially among 18-29 female electoral women, who haven't yet been defined and often don't vote, if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford testified in connection with the claims of the candidate for the Supreme Court’s opinion on sexual crime, analysts predicted a negative reaction of the voters if the Republicans insisted on confirmation.
Earlier this week, Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of the Republic of Republic, said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As the director of the U.S. Police Department (USP) said in a news channel interview, Guy Sessel, "it's not about votes on the committee, final votes, or the fact that Cavano is on the dock of the defendants, but how they react to the situation and how they've acted."
However, Americans' thoughts about whose testimony to believe Ford or Cavanaugh split up, a little bit more support for Ford.
According to a new survey by the UGov 41% of respondents, they believe or believe the Ford testimony rather, but the Kawano testimony believes or believes more than 35 percent of those surveyed.
In addition, 38 percent of those surveyed said that they believed that Cavano was giving or probably giving false testimony while 30 percent of those surveyed said the same thing to Ford.
The Guardian reports that after Flake’s pressure, the FBI conducted a survey of Ford charges and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Ford gave a witness under the Legal Committee of the Senate oath of how Cavano attacked her while she was drinking when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court’s office showed her his genitals at a party during their studies at the University of Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web discoverer plans to launch a "new Internet" to create a Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global Internet, starts a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last design of technology legends, Inrupt, is to develop an open source platform called Solid, which is the idea of Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store the data and whom to access the information.
In an exclusive interview by Fast Company Berners-Lee, it was a joke that the purpose of Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about a startup.
It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create a personymic online storage of data or POD.
It can store contacts, lists of current affairs, calendar, audio library, and other tools for personal use and work.
It's like using Google Drive at the same time, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser.
The unique feature of this personal online data store is that it's completely consistent with the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the spread of personal capacity through data."
According to General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to activate resources, processes, and skills so that the Solid platform becomes available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms acquired in IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own offline applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models are experiencing profound changes in a short time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication at Gilead Berners-Lee, he wrote that an Inrupt mission is to protect commercial energy and ecosystems and to help protect the integrity and quality of a new network created on the Solid platform base.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Consorzium of the World Wide Web at MlT.
In the last months Berners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate over network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt Berners-Lee, the founder and director of the Conservative of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of the commission of the Church of the Order of Victoria during World War I
The only representative of the Church of England who got the Order of Victoria for fighting during World War I is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was rewarded for participating in the Altaics at Belsands and Levokur on September 29, 1918.
However, he died of a sniper’s bullet four days later and never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military award.
On Saturday two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade at Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called "extraordinaryly symbolic" that the discovery of memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed a feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann transferred his battalion across the St.
Later he hurried to a firecracker and, with a desperate courage, raced forward, one burst into the field cannon and destroyed three cannons of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Vanne shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the war was over.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather did something that he would never be able to repeat and deserve respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann have put a crown on the show following the Brentgood Group.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very proud of what he's doing in this parade," and he said, "the honor that so many people show him."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but they were shown the Pep Squa.
Imagine that you are not sleeping all night just to watch the big event of the Ballator 206 tournament, and you are denied the opportunity to review the main event.
In the tournament posters held in San Jose, there were 13 fights, including six fights that were broadcast live at night in Britain by five channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Hegard Musaas and Rory McDonald were preparing to come together in the fight, the TV audience in Britain was frozen in amazement when the lead Pepa appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting.
Some observers were not thrilled because they did not sleep until early in the morning waiting for battle.
One fan wrote Twitter that switching to children's cartoons was "some kind of bad joke."
"In line with the order of the content government that was broadcast at 6 a.m., it was inadequate, so they had to send a baby transmission," said Dave Schwartz, senior VP on marketing and public relations when they asked him about television,
"Pepap's Sake," yes."
The president of the company, Bellator Scott Cocker, promised to work on the broadcasts in the future to cover viewers in Britain.
"I think if we talk about the broadcast, we can do it," said Koker.
"But it's Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have a Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was off, we received a lot of messages that we answered, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turned out that this was inconsequential to governmental regulations.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to cut the tournament down to five fights, instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to get the fan signal back, but we've put that aside for now.
It's a really bad situation."
Tom Daily felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper in the water of Tom Daily tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claimed he didn't understand that "not everyone looks like him," until he went to high school.
By taking part in the Desert Island Disccs transfer on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he pointed out that he spoke frankly about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that fatherhood had reduced his concern about winning the Olympics.
The bear, who has been conducting the program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to hospital for months.
Upon arriving as a couple for the first program of Lavern, the Daily announced that he felt worse than others when he was a child, because "the society didn't accept when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the feeling of less value and the difference was exactly what gave me strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that something worth while wasn't going to disappoint all those who eventually learned about its orientation.
The two - time bronze Olympic prize winner became a famous LBHT community fighter and took advantage of this year's Joint Games in Australia to invoke more countries to decryize homosexuality.
He said that he was frank about his beliefs because he was happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and he wanted to give this hope to others.
A three - year - old world champion admitted that his feelings for a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was truly a surprise.
The bottom line was a 20-year-old winner, Oscar, last year's winner, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so many things at such a young age," (At the first Olympics he spoke at 14 years of age, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone his own age who would also survive these kinds of collapses.
In June, a son came into the marriage called Robert Ray Black-Daily, and since then, according to the Daily, his enlightenment has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd only think of what I should get the gold," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
He said that his father could not accept the idea of the end and asked them just before he died if they had bought the cards for London’s Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him to ‘ don't sit in the front row because you're not going to be there again," said Daley.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died did I realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, the Daly took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that," said the Daily.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song –Proud (Gord) in the performance of Hyzer Smoll – which was resonating with him during preparation for the Olympics and still calls an ant.
The Desert Island Discs program is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15, according to English summer time.
On Saturday, from the Ryder Cup match, Mikelson was taken out, which was not in shape.
American Phil Michélson will set up a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game at the Ryder Club, but he has to restore the uniform so that this event doesn't make him unhappy.
Mikelson, who's a record 12th time in a tournament that takes place once every two years, made Captain Jim Fowrick out of the game at the time of the fork and the fork.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-day winner encouraged the team and trained on the side, hoping to control emotion.
Because Mikelson wasn't famous for the exact blows, even when he was on the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete didn't quite fit in with the sophisticated Le Golf National golf courses, where a fat is usually punished for wandering blows.
And if the field itself is not so bad, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mikelson will have to meet up with Francesco Molinari, who won all his games this week with Tommy Flitzwood.
If Americans who fall three points after 12 single matches start well, Mikelson's match can be crucial.
He expressed confidence in his sportsman, perhaps with little to add.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on his back, hugged me, and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furrick.
"He has no doubt about his power.
Mikelson is a member of a hall of fame that has done so much for the teams in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't think he'd play two matches.
I predicted more matches, but it did, and so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, in the field, like everyone else."
If Mikelson comes out on Saturday, he'll beat the record of Nick Faldo, who played the biggest game in the Ryder Cup.
He'll probably finish his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matches his own personal achievements.
In Mikelson’s account, 18 wins, 20 defeats, and 7 night results, Fulrick said that his presence could play a crucial role in the team.
"He's funny, he's biting, funny, he likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's cool to have on the team," said Funk.
"I think younger players had a good time getting on it, and also this week, and it was interesting to watch it.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a big break doesn't solve anything.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the impact of a single break in the last day of the Ryder Party doesn't guarantee a victory.
Dutchman debuted in 1997 in a match on Walderram Club, where a team led by Sev Ballesteros, who was five points ahead of the Americans, but won a small break with a result of 141/2:131.2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the Walderhams field; a big break in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderam's field where we had the best to win," said Bjorn after watching the winning games of Class 2018 with a result of 5:3 Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, which is 106.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing is yet solved.
We need to play with the maximum amount of change tomorrow.
Go out into the fields and do what you need.
The game will only be over after the result appears on the billboard.
We have the goal of winning this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're pretty well aware who's against us, the best players in the world."
He said, "I'll never run ahead of time.
Everything can go different tomorrow.
Tomorrow, we're looking for individual matches, and that's something else.
It's great to play the field with your partner when things go well, but it's when you're standing there alone that you can check that you're a golfer.
Here's how you configure the players to perform tomorrow: at the limits of the possibilities.
You leave your partner without support and now he has to show you what he can do."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number of Jim Fuller expects his partners to play a better game on a level, except for Jordan Spayta and Justin Thomas, who picked three points out of four.
He was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created the Chudo in Media.
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized players before the last day of the competition.
"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medea.
When the initiative moves toward someone else’s side, the players in the middle of the race are under special pressure.
We put the players in the team as if they were going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas is commissioned to try to lead a counter attack on Rory McGillroy, and then on the first half of the European team, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Poulter.
"These partners are the ones I choose in this order because I want to distribute the effort uniformly throughout the entire game," so Bjorn commented his choice of players at the individual games.
The new German battleship was put back in action
Germany's most modern Navy fleet had to take action in 2014 instead of the old-fashioned warships of the Cold War, but, according to local media information, it won't happen until at least the next year because of broken systems and a rapid increase in spending.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, received from a spokesman for the military department, entering the Ranland-Paltz ship, the main vessel of the modern Bahden-Würtemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the shipment made damage to the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Biden-Weretemberg, who were ordered by the Navy in 2007, should replace the old-fashioned "Bremen" class.
Understandably, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air and counter-creative rockets, and some technology to reduce visibility, including radiolomatic, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical security, and it is expected that new projections will not be able to return to the port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warn that because of constant delays over modern warships that would increase Germany’s military power in the sea, it will also grow old at the time of exploitation.
A long-term F125 was put in the headlines of a newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to take action and returned it to the Shipyard of Bloham + Vosss in Hamburg.
It was the first time a warship returned to the ship after the shipment.
There are few known reasons for the return, but German media mentioned significant "programm and hardware effects" that made a warship unfit for military operations.
Now, software failures are especially important, because the Bahden-Wourtemberg crew consists of about 120 sailors -- only half the number of military men who served on the old Bremens.
It has also been found that the vessel has a large excess weight, making its exploitive characteristics worse, and limiting its capacity for further modernization.
It is believed that the Ring-Paltz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, another problem was the aggregate cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros became colossal 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion U.S.).
The problems with getting new frigates are especially important in the light of recent warnings about the decline of the German Navy.
At the beginning of the year, the Bouddestagus commissioned by Hans-Peter Barthels armed forces reported that there were “a vast array of ships capable of carrying out the fighting. ”
The official stated that the situation had deteriorated rapidly over a period of time, since the old ships were out of service and the new ships were not coming.
He expressed deep regret that none of the Baden-Würtemberg fleets were able to complete the navy.
National Roads will observe the secret life of bats
A new research done on land habitat in Scotland’s Highlands aims to determine how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in the future to take action to conserve them.
In In Inverry Gardens in Western Russia, scientists at the National Highway Scotland will observe species such as non-topar dwarfs and non-topes of pygmy, as well as ears of normal and water night.
Special registerers will be placed in strategic locations in the land area to monitor bat behavior during the season.
The staff and volunteers at the National Road in Scotland will also do mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and belonging of bat calls.
It is then planned to develop a detailed animal habitat map and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a nature protection adviser in the National Roads of Scotland, hopes that research will help determine which areas of life are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help assess the effectiveness of environmental care measures (for example, the formation of meadows) and determine the optimal methods of conservation for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bat populations have greatly decreased in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by active construction and expansion of areas that deprive them of breeding grounds.
Other negative factors include wind and lighting, the sticky paper for flies, the chemical processing of building materials, and domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because of night - hunting, their ears are more effective in catching prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect insects and to prevent flight trajectory.
The National Road of Scotland, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, takes the problems of bats seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly investigate, inspect nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, and it's located in the Trives area in the Damphris-end-Galloway region, and it's home to eight out of ten species of bats that live in Scotland.
David Thompson, the city manager, says that this is an ideal place for them.
"On the property of Trive, the bat's excellent terms," he assures us.
"There are old buildings, lots of giant trees and other suitable living conditions.
But we still need to know a lot about bats, because of the research we do here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to do to thrive."
He insists that it's important to check the area for bats before doing any technical work, because the accidental destruction of one breeding site for breeding may kill up to 400 females and cubs, which is likely to result in the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture, or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Center, called for the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still haven't discovered the characteristics of populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape, and his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German edition
Krishtian Rothald called charges against rape and claimed that people were "intending to attract attention" by using his name.
His lawyers are prepared to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Piegel, which reported suspicions.
The American woman Catherine Mayor accused the mob of collecting Portugal and the Juventus soccer club in the rape in 2009 at a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to Der Spiegel's Friday magazine, Ronaldo was supposed to pay her $3755,000 for silence.
A few hours after the charges of 33 - year - old Ronaldo applied to 142 million of his fans in video broadcasts in Instagram, calling appropriate messages "off."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's indictment is slander, and that's a statement made on a camera by a five-year-old leader of the Golden Ball.
"They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to live with me, but these kinds of situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy person, and I'm fine," added a football player, smiling.
According to the Reuters news agency, R. Rondou’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for what they called "unprecedented public suspicion of privacy."
A lawyer, Christian Sherz, said that a football player would be willing to make compensation for "moral damage in the size of a violation which is probably one of the most serious cases of personal rights abuse in recent years."
It is claimed that this incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino Hotel room in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the Rhonaldou nightclub and Majorga, they returned to the player’s number, where he seemed to have analized her, and they were transferred to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Major says that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and said he was "99 percent good boy", which he raised by one percent.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model but with mutual consent.
Majora also says that she went to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to refrigeration, because she was afraid of revenge, and she was on guard against "public humiliation."
Now, a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her old deal, because she continues to suffer because of an incident that she says has a place.
At the time of the incident pointed out, Ronaldo was preparing to move to FK Real Madrid from McCester United, and this summer he became a player in Italian football, Uwentus, in 100 million euros.
Great Britain will "long-term regret" the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain will be "longly sorry" if it loses its status as a world leader in auto production after Brexit, and that's what Greg Clark's minister of economics warns about.
He added that he was thrilled by the statement made by Toyota UK representatives who told BBC journalists that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, the company would have to suspend its factory and production in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," assures Secretary Clark.
A Japanese automakers claimed that the effects of delays on the border in case of Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
Bernaston, where the Toyota model Auris and Avensis are produced, released some 150,000 cars last year, 90% of them exported to the rest of the European Union.
"To my opinion, if Britain Exceeded the E.U. at the end of March our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyote in Bernaston.
Other auto manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about the impact of Britain’s exit from the EU without international trade agreements.
For example, in the BMW company, it was stated that the Mini Modelry factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main fears of automakers are that Brexit without agreement can cause risks for supply chains.
Toyota's production line is operating in the operation mode of the details and materials according to the need - details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars that are made for order.
If Britain leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, the border may have details on it, resulting in delays and lack of materials.
And as a company says, there's no longer much to place on Toyota's composition for one day, so production has to stop.
Greg Clark noted that in terms of organizing relations with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Cequers Plan), there is a framework for preventing problems at the border.
"We need a deal, we need to make an optimal deal, which I think will enable not only to succeed at the present moment but also to take advantage of the perspectives that have arisen," he said at the BBC Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio Radio.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives, and of other auto manufacturers, we need to preserve highly effective supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to tell how long the production has been stopped, but in the long run, it is expected that increasing costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, as a result, cause jobs to decrease.
Peter Tsalris, head of the Unite professional community at a factory in Bernaston, which has worked here for 24 years, reported that other participants are extremely concerned, "I can say from experience that cut-out jobs don't recover."
The government representative said, "We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for building our future relations with the EU."
Tramp and Rosenstein's meeting can be delayed again, marked in the White House
According to the White House on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Trump with the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, can be held for another week, while debate is under discussion about exemplaring Bretta Cavanano’s candidates for the Supreme Court’s office.
Rosenstein controls the work of special prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's intervention in elections, relations between the assistants of Trampus and Russia, and potential interference with the President's justice.
For a few months, in Washington, D.C., the possibility of release is discussed by the deputy attorney general, who would endanger Müller’s independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about using microphones to record conversation with Tramp and the possibility of an early cessation of president's 25th correction.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House in the background of reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, meeting Tramp, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was assigned Thursday.
Tramp stated that he wouldn't want to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid the coincidence of a time-lapse meeting with the Council of the Legal Committee of the Senate where Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazie Ford.
On Friday, Tramp arranged a weekly FBI investigation on charges against Cavano, which added to the vote in the Senate.
Pre-disreator Trump, Sarah Saunders, did it on Fox News Sunday TV show.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There's no meeting date, maybe it's going to happen this week, and I expect it to be delayed for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I'm constantly making sure the press has the latest information."
Some journalists did not agree: Sanders did not conduct a news briefing at the White House on September 10.
Lead Chris Walles asked why.
Sanders replied that the time-ending of the bruphins was not associated with the ill-representation of public games from TV reporters, although he said, "Don't deny that they're playing public."
Then she assumed that Tramp himself would communicate more with the press.
"The President answers questions more often than any president before him," she said, without referring to the source, "The subject speaks for itself."
Sanders said that bruphins would still be going on, but "if the press can ask the President of the United States questions, it's better than talking to me."
We're trying to talk to the press a lot, and it should have been particularly evident in the last few weeks, and it's not worse to talk to the President of the U.S. than the press conference."
The tram regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings, or press conferences for the participation of high - ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York City this week, the president may have demonstrated why it is, by being rude and sometimes weird to journalists.
Scotland, a national health secretary, requested a letter to EU staff in response to fear over the Brexit
The National Health Secretary of Health wrote to citizens of other EU countries who work at the National Health Service in Scotland to express appreciation for their work and ask them to continue after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of Parliament in Scotland, sent a letter in less than six months before Britain came out of the EU.
The government of Scotland has already taken on an commitment to cover the cost of applications to receive the status of permanent migrant for EU citizens working in autonomous state services.
In her letter Mrs. Freeman observed: “In the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU were under way on the solution, and this autumn should be followed.
But the U.K. government is increasing its preparation for a possible solution without an agreement.
I know that this period can be very disturbing to you.
That's why I'd like to stress again how I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleges from all over the European Union and beyond share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving health service to the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, we really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercrombie underwent surgery after head injury
Christion Ebercrombies, who suffered emergency surgery after getting head injuries in a Sunday match against Wanderbilt Comodorrez, was lost by his team at 3:27 p.m.
The chief coach of the Tennysy State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He went to the side line where he was bad," said Reed.
According to the side line, the coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it on their noses for further examination.
The official representative of the Tennesey State Tiger reported to Chris Harris from WSMV (Nasville, Tennessee), that Ebercrombie was operated at the University of Wanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that while there's no evidence of the type and severity of the trauma, the Tennysy State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player gets injured.
Ebercrombie, second-party, has spent his first season in the Tennessee State Tigers after he left the Illinois team.
He did five shots of the ball on Sunday before he got out of the game, so he's got 18 wins per season.

Foreign buyers will pay more tribute if they buy real estate in Britain. According to Thora's new plans, extra money will be spent to help the homeless
This event neutralizes all of Corbin's attempts to attract young voters.
The higher national cost will come from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
As Teresa May announced today, aliens buying real estate in the U.K. will pay more resources to help the homeless.
This step can be viewed as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to attract young voters with promises of a more affordable home, with the aim of highly paid workers.
The higher the customs will be the physical and legal people who don't pay taxes in Britain, and the government will direct the government to help those who have to spend the night under the open air.
An additional tribute, which includes two - year - old promotion to the second home and residence, may be about three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, they hope to attract an additional 120 million pounds a year.
Experts estimate that 13 percent of the new real estate built in London is owned by foreign citizens, leading to higher prices and a challenge for those who just dream of their own housing.
Many wealthy countries, especially the capital, are out of business because large numbers of foreign buyers live most of their time outside the country.
A new plan of action appeared just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lowering of state customs to make housing more accessible to young people.
He charged large construction companies with high-level housing prices by buying land without further use, and he urged Teresa May to give up the quota for affordable real estate to fix the "fuge of housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of important real estate reforms, such as rent control and impoverishment.
It also offers to expand the authority of local councils in the construction of new housing.
Theresa May said, "Last year, I promised to devote my career to restoring British dreams -- for every new generation of life must be better.
It needs to change in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their own future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain and foreign companies buy housing on the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is beyond reach, and the problem of open-source living is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "For all I'm trying to do is be the main trainer in collecting Scotland."
Jack Ross's chief trainer, FK Sanderland, says that "over everything" will ever lead Scotland's collection.
A 42-year-old Scotsman set about restoring the club from the north-east country, which is now the third place in the First soccer league, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to Stedium Of Light this summer, returning last season F. Sent-Mirren in Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to second collecting Scotland, but it's over," said Ross during the Sports Sound program at BBC Scottland air station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched a game in the Gomden-Park Stadium, which has always attracted me.
The only hope for me remains to be successful in being the main coach of the club."
Ross's chiefs at the Sanderlands, in particular, were Dick Ococat, David Meiss, Sam Ellardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poett, and Paolo Di Canio.
The former chief trainer of FlF "Alla Attlech" said he didn't feel the excitement of going to a large club after such authoritative names, predispositioning proposals from "Bransley" and "Ipswich Town."
"At present, I'm going to assume that I'm successful if the club goes back to the Prime Secrets.
Because of its structure and material-tech security, this club is no doubt equivalent to the equivalent of the Premier Secrets," he remarked.
"It will be a challenge, but the other outcome I will hardly consider successful."
Ross has only been building a coach career for three years, and he has been a second trainer at Dampbarton and spent 15 months at the F.H.I.
He then helped Alloa get on its way after FK got into the third Division, and the next season from the Sent-Mirren came from the flight stage to the title of the winners of the first Division.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his game career at the F.C.I.C.C.C., "Folkerk," "Sent-Mirren" and "Hamilton Academy."
"I found myself on the road," he recalls, speaking of moving to the FEMA.
"I sincerely believed that the trainer's activity was more suitable for me than for playing.
That sounds strange, because I was successful, and I made a good living and achieved some height.
But playing is not easy.
There are many challenges to face each week.
I'm still dealing with them through stress and stress, but as a primary coach, I feel at my place.
I've always been interested in training, and I've never felt as comfortable in my entire adult life as when I chose this profession."
Full interview you'll be able to hear a sound on Sunday, September 30, on the radio wave Radio Sutland from 12:00 to 3:00 in British summer time.
Survey: 17:30 a.m. is the perfect time for a beer cup.
The summer heat helped to increase Britain’s pubs, which survive less than the best of times, but increased the pressure on restaurant networks.
According to the sale calculations in pubs and bars, July went up by 2.7%, while the profits in restaurants went down by 4.8%.
The author of Peter Martin of the CGA’s research on business development, observed: "A lot of solar weather and more durable than expected, England's involvement in the World Cup, July passed the same pattern as the previous month, when pabs grew to 2.8%, and the restaurants got worse.
The red drop by 1.8% in July has increased.
Spiders and drink - oriented bars, which have the best rate yet, the increase in their income is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pabes with food were also affected by the heat but not so much as the restaurants.
It seems that only drinking is of interest to visitors.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of drinks per month increased by 6.6%, and food sales dropped by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hotel business at RSM, said, "We've seen some trends since the end of April.
Weather and massive social or sports events remain the primary factors affecting sales in the inner market.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to lose their income, that the annual sale of sales by 4.8% causes much anxiety in terms of the need to reduce spending.
The long hot summer doesn't come at the best time for food-spots, and we'll see if we can have a more moderate temperature that we've seen in August, give them such an essential rest."
The general increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new institutions, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowing output to the market for new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s main sales indicator of pab, bars, and restaurants in Britain is a reflection of the combined productivity of 47 working groups that exceed 9 billion pounds.
One in five children has a hidden social network account from their parents
As evidenced by research, 1 child in 5, sometimes under 11 years old, has a parentless account and teachers on social networking
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in counterfeit pages in Instagram
This news has raised concern about possible sexual content
20% of students said they had a basic account to show to their parents
One in five children, sometimes less than 11 years old, creates an account on social networks that is hidden from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a growing number of fake pages in Instagram, a social network for photo exchange.
This news has raised concern about possible sexual content.
Twenty percent of students reported having a clean "base" account that shows parents and one or more private ones.
The mother who happened to come across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw the call, "Rape me."
A study conducted by Digitalhood UK and Headmasters' and Headmistries' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles in social networks. Half of these children admitted that an additional account is secret.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said, "We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel like creating an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Alyde Doyle is going to be the "representative of the interests of athletes" in the Council of Natural History.
Alelyd Doyle is elected to the Schoolish Attletics board as an independent director during the annual board of government members.
The head of the Council of Yen Beatty called this step an excellent opportunity for those who are in charge of the sports movement to take advantage of its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Ailid is using great respect for athletes in Scotland, Great Britain and the world, and we believe that by including her in the council, athletic sports in Scotland will bring great benefits," assured Betty.
Doyle said, "I'm inspired to speak as a representative of the interests of athletes, and I hope I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
American, four-time Olympic champion, who won 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 games in Atlanta, and now a BBBC sports viewer, lost the opportunity to go through a transistor attack.
He wrote in Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much.
With incredible effort, I was able to recover completely, and I learned to walk again, and today I am practicing dynamic exercises!
Thank you for the words of support!"
The women's milk-snaper ads compared to cows, where the thoughts of the Internet users split.
The milk - suckler maker was confronted with the unique response of Internet users to an advertisement in which young mothers are compared to effective cows.
In recognition of the release of a product called "the world's first low-powered, low-powered milk-suctor", Elvie's technological consumer product firm released an advertising in humoral music video style to demonstrate freedom provided by a new suction agent.
The four true mothers dance in a filled hay-filled box under a song that contains these words, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail" and "You see it's not a winter, it's my breasts."
And the choir goes on, "Chop off, suck up the kids, suck them, suck them, suck them up, suck them, so that they don't waste milk."
However, a commercial video published on Facebook created a heated discussion online.
The video came up with 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, but the response of Internet users is consistent, and many noted that advertising has underestimated the production of milk in industry.
"Not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to conceive and give birth to milk, but their children are taken away from them a few days after they're born," wrote one of the users.
Elvie milk-sniffer can easily be hidden in a feeding machine (Elvie/Morther)
Here's another comment: "I realized it was traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why don't you bring them in for milk sucklers for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone else said, "This advertisement is very different from reality."
The other users spoke in favor of advertising, and one of the women had a very funny video.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
Such a thing would be invaluable if it was still breast - feeding.
When I was sucking my milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising was a bit crazy, but I didn’t look into it for hidden meaning.
"A great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "The funky commercial of the moms who suck up milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
It's not about highlighting the benefits and disadvantages of the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women show the milk sucklers hidden in their braziers.
The concept of an advertising campaign is that many women who use similar products feel that they are cows.
However, Elvie’s suction works perfectly quietly, without wires or tubes, and is easily hidden in a feeding soup, which allows women to move, hold children, and even walk outside.
Ana Balareen, partner and executive creative director of the Mother advertising agency, put it this way: "Elvine's suction is so revolutionary that he demanded a vivid and provocative presentation.
By paralleling the women who cure milk and the real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the aspects of breast - feeding, in an exciting and interesting way, to demonstrate an incredible sense of freedom that would bring a new suction.
Elvie suction is not the first time you get into news headlines.
Within a week of fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the manifest with this product while she was displaying clothes from a fashion designer named Martha Jacbos.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of disabled migrant children increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively constant, partly because a rigid rhetoric and policy on the Tromp administration made it difficult for children to be placed in caregivers.
Traditionally, there were immigrants themselves who had no papers, and now they are afraid to endanger their own ability to stay in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that the data would be transferred to immigration services.
Last week Matthew Albens, a high - ranking Bureau of Immigration and customs control, testified to Congress that the Bureau of Laborers had arrested dozens of people who had filed applications for caring for minors without supervision.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal past.
"Nearly 80% of the people who are caregivers or members of their households are illegal in the country, and many of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Mr. Albrens.
According to the staff of the orphanage, to handle the cases more quickly, officials have set up new rules that require that some of the children appear before the trial within a month of detention, not 60 days later, as they used to.
Many of them will be able to use video conferences rather than come to court personally to prove their legal status in front of immigration judges.
Those not entitled to asylum by a court order will be quickly deported.
According to asylum workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will feel anxious or depressed, which can result in outbursts of violence or attempts to escape.
Officials claim that these problems are increasing in institutions larger than Tornillo, where it's more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving the children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or to say good - bye to our friends, we could increase the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S., France, and Turkey to immediately lead the troops
In addition, in front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Valid al-Muall urged Syrian refugees to return home, although war has been going on in the country for eight years.
Moal, who also works as deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign powers were illegal in the Syrian land under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so "representing them will be appropriate."
"They have to leave immediately and don't set any terms," he declared to the assembly.
He insisted that "war of terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He claimed that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian areas" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has placed about 2,000 military servants in Syria, and they're mainly teaching and consulting the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bahar al-Adade.
In a war - torn country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
As for the refugees, Mualel assured us that there was a proper condition in the country for their return, and he accused some Western countries of spreading unprovable fears, which prevented the refugees from coming back.
"We called for international community and humanitarian organizations to help people get back," he said.
"We see efforts to fly purely humanitarianly."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not provide Syria with aid in restoring the country until a political treaty between Asada and an opposition to the end of war is established.
The UN Diplomats will report that a recent treaty between Russia and Turkey about the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last large fleet of rebels, opened the way for further political negotiations.
Because of the Russian-natural agreement, it was able to prevent the huge advance of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to a province of three million people.
However, Moal stressed that the treaty had "tendial terms," and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the Jahidists, including those associated with Al-Kaedi Fronto en-Nsra, who would "be destroyed."
Emisser of UN Staffan de City hopes shortly to gather first a new committee to be formed by representatives of the government and opposition to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and create conditions for the elections.
Moal set up a condition for the Syrian government to participate on the committee, claiming that his work should be restricted by ‘ examining the articles of a valid constitution, ’ and warned against intervention.
Why Tramp will be reassembled
According to this logic, Trampa may be reelected in 2020, if many liberal viewers are possibly expected, he will not be authorized until shortly after the scandal and impipment.
No doubt that would be the most dramatic conclusion of presidentship ever!
At present, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of prime-time viewers has more than doubled (up to 1.6 million) on the CNNN channel and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News on average, 2.4 million people in prime-time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the program The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable came to the top of a 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when the main news was discussed.
"It's the fire that attracts people, because it's beyond our comprehension," said Neil Bere, executive producer of the "Last candidate" drama on the ABC public secretary who becomes president after a devastating attack on Capitoline.
Nell Skowell, an experienced human writer, and author of the book "Stirthless Things: And a few rigid truths about penetration into a Hollywood club" suggest another theory.
She remembered a trip to Boston taxi in 2016.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trampa.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said.
Chaos is having fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington's stories can determine the future of Roy versus Wade, the possibility of the reuniting of immigrant families and the state of the global economy.
And isolation is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it's not possible to say that you're just trying to remain informed citizens when you're observing six hours of using Bob Woodworth's "well-known" sources for his book "Straight", the jacket Paul Manafort on the skin of the ostrich for 15,000 dollars (" clothes for the arrogant") -- so wrote in The Washington Post, and the results of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy published by Scormí Daniels.
For me, for example, super Mario will never be the same again.
"The experience of reality show is partly related to what you eat every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of Welhouse Containment and author of the "The Lombard Star," about the rotary composition and the everyday plots of the "Tramp" show.
If you can afford to miss at least one episode, you can be hopelessly behind it.
When I was able to meet Mr. Fleas this week in his house on the north coast of Kauai Island, there was a warm sunny weather (27 ° C.), but he was sitting at home looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get off the TV, not when Brett Cawano was brought before the Council of the Senate, but the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on its hair.
"I remember when we were making all those crazy shows, and people were saying that this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Flies.
"I thought it was a joke, but I think they were right."

External contributions to the worst intermediate elections in Congress
It's no wonder that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, additional cash donations are directed, because through a review of the boundaries of the elected circuits, two effective Congressmen are competing for one chair.
In fighting for this Primański district of Pittsburgh, which has recently changed borders, a democracy comes in, a member of the Conor Lemb, who won a victory in another county at the extra elections last spring.
Lemb opposes another valid congressman, Republican Kitt Rothfs, which is now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which borders largely the next 17th.
The paintings were reworked after, in January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old borders of the region had been decided in favor of the Republicans against the Constitution.
The campaign in the new 17th district brought up a fierce opposition between the financial units of the major parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee on Congress (DCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
The name Lemba became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning with a minimal advantage in the 18th county during the additional elections in Congress in March, which were used by the public wide attention.
President Donald Trump won this 20-point county.
Political experts have given minor advantages to democracies.
In the United States, the opportunity to punish El Salvador for supporting China was changed.
The Diplomats reminded us of the weak resistance from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panamanians, who had previously supported Beijing.
In June 2017, Tramp held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel, who had also had a hotel in Panama before the partners discovered the staff who had been hired by Trump Organization.
The officials of the State Department decided to revoke U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of the “last-last-last-day decisions on the ignorance of Taiwan, ” declared the press Department of Gezer Neuert at the beginning of this month.
But the sanctions were only against El Salvador, which got about 140 million U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, as well as social and economic development support.
The fines that were offered to reduce financial support and the purpose limits on the wheelchair would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment rate and killings.
According to internal councils of officials from North and Central America, a conference was held at a high level devoted to security and economic prosperity, and it was held last year as a step forward in the efforts of migrants in the United States.
But by the middle of September, senior officials had given the impression that they wanted the conference to happen, and actually the issue of sanction against El Salvador ended.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is now planning to present at a conference that was held in mid - October to indicate what the administration considers important.
At that, three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic because there were no new hard messages or penalties on Washington’s side.
Mr. Bolton's representative at the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that were reported by three American officials, two of whom are diplomats, on the basis of anonymity.
The information they gave confirmed by a foreign analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke on anonymous terms.
Study History
The following unpleasant situation may be the report by special prosecutor Robert Muller about possible violation of Trampe law, a powerful proof of what can be found in the public information available now.
As reported, as part of his investigation, Muller checks the possible relationship between Trampus campaign and the attack on our voting system from Russia.
If the influence in Congress goes to other hands, Trampus will have to report to Congressmen as well as to the voters and finally to their fellow citizens.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't want to say that Tramp's fall is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
We all have a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that determines the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if only the West were to oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is defined by these turning points, and the violent movements of democracy accelerate or slow down.
The Americans are waiting for a few of these critical moments.
What will we do if Tramp frees the deputy attorney general of Rhode Rosenstein, a man whose fate depends on Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein was in trouble when this newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record conversations with the president and to give thought to the subject of the failure of Tramp office.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccuracy.
"How will we respond if the investigation against Bretta Kavano, which recently started by the FBI, is not well done or honest enough, or if the candidate Cavalves in the Supreme Court is approved despite the strong accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, are we in the middle term to vote for those members of Congress who can hold Trampa's responsibility?
If we fail these trials, bad times will come for democracy.
But I believe we're not going to prove it through a lesson that I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech - speaking Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my Polish house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me out to light Saturday candles on a test table.
With this legacy, can I not look with optimism into the future?"

Graham Dorrans with the Rangers is optimistic about meeting Vienna's Rapides.
The Rangers takes "Rapides" on Thursday, and after a very impressive night in Spain, in a game of "Wilarrral" at the beginning of this month, the victory over the Austrians will give the Scottish Club a good chance to leave the G. League of Europe.
Because of knee injury, Gram Dorrans was able to play for the first time during the season only in the Wilarral match, which ended with a score of two. But he thinks that FK Rangers might use this as a tramplin to achieve more.
"This was a good result for us, because "Wilyarral" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with the hope of getting something and getting one point.
Maybe at the end of the match, we could go forward, but the whole night, maybe we can think of it as a fair outcome.
In the first mystery, the opponent was better, but after a break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday, there will be another major opposition to the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy, our future opponents have shown a good outcome in their last game, but we can count on support for fans, and I'm sure we can fight and get a good outcome.
Last year was definitely a tough year, from my trauma to the change in the club itself, but now the situation is normal.
We have a great warehouse, and all the guys are happy, and training's good.
I hope we can go on, leave behind the past season and succeed."
Women are losing sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Even though the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to organize themselves, few talked about it to their family members.
About half of the people involved in a survey of the Company, said they talked to their husband or wife about the value of long - term care.
Only 10% of those surveyed talked about it with the kids.
"People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they don't want to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalside Department on Life insurance.
That's where we're going to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: your family will not be able to provide needed care unless you inform your wishes beforehand.
Consult your counselor and family to determine where and how to receive care, since it can be an important factor in determining value.
Include a financial consultant who might recommend how to cover appropriate expenses.
Long-term funding sources include a traditional policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self-sustaining security (as long as you have money).
Work hard to prepare legal documents that will allow you to avoid legal drafting in advance.
Prepare your trust for a representative who will monitor your medical care and ensure that your wishes are met if you are not able to do so personally.
It is also recommended that we form trust at the expense of money.
Choose the trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if you fail.
Remember the small details, imagine that one of your aging parents needs emergency medical attention, so he is rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about medication and allergies?
Write down such information in order to be ready.
"It's not just about finance, it's important who the doctors are," Martin says,
What drugs to take and what to take
Who's looking after the dog.
Prepare such a plan."
In Ilfrakuma a man fired a number of times from a pneumatic rifle
The man fired a gun several times as he returned home from the party.
A 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Square area in Ilfraum, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, his stomach, and his hand.
The officers described the shooting that happened at 002:30 for British summer time as "extraordination."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not a threat to life but a search for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, reports government officials, but the number of victims may increase.
Because of out-of-the-box communication systems that are in the hands of aid officials, they can't get any information from Dongala's reagentship, a region north of Pow, which is close to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
At the end of the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palau.
Here are some basic facts about the island of Sulawesi, the city of Palo and Dongala.
Palo, capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with a population of 3,79,800 according to 2017.
When the tsunami earthquake occurred, the city celebrated its 40th year.
Dongala is a regenerative that extends more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the coast line in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
According to a 2017 report, the administrative region at the bottom of the province is about 299,200 people.
Fishing and agriculture are major areas of the province’s central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
There's also a lot of importance in producing nickel in the province, but mostly focused on Moroval, on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to an Indonesian agency for reducing the effects of natural disasters in the last 100 years of Palm and Dongal, tsunamis have occurred several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people died as a result of a tsunami in Dongal, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, tsunamis also covered the western half of Dongal, and nine people died.
Indonesia is situated in a sensically active Pacific fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acheg in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Acheg.
2005: By the end of March at the beginning of April, a series of powerful earthquakes had struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia’s largest island, and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast, resulting in the death of about 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra, a magnitude 7.6 quake was recorded.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake hit one of the Mentawe Islands near Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 30 feet [10 m] high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Pogija Republic of Acheg, triggering destruction and panic with the fact that people had not forgotten the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, the tsunami was gone, but more than 100 people were killed under the debris.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Lombo tourist island in Indonesia, resulting in the death of more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless buildings, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island immediately.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son was arrested for charges of domestic violence
Treka Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska, and a vice president, Sarah Palin, were arrested for charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report published by the State Police in Alaska, 29 - year - old Palina of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence and accused him of preventing violence and opposition during arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the possible crimes, he took away her phone.
According to KTU, Palin is in custody of Matanas-Siesta's custody of 500 dollars.
He was brought before trial on Saturday, where he declared himself innocent when asked if he recognized his fault, reported himself online.
Pauline is charged with three issues of class A, which involve arrest by one year and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with class B's problems, which is a day of imprisonment and a 2000 dollar fine.
It is not the first time that Pauline has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sara Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is now on the minds of the Alaskan veteran court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, and also with preventing reports of domestic violence and carrying weapons in the state of alcohol abuse when this incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her on the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin exposed groups of veterans for justifying her son’s cruel behavior as a post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.

At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 quake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks of communications and electricity have come out of formation, and the number of victims may increase in the next day.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video on social networking shows the moment when things hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the Beaches of Palau when a tsunami struck the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifulo Seipal, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City, resulting in eight deaths, a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crime since 1953.
In October of 30-year-old Saipling, at the drive of a rented house depotape, he rode a bicycle track along the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and started to hit down the cyclists and pedestrians that were on his way.
According to a report on the plan to get the executions committed in the south district of New York to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipel had deliberately killed eight persons and deliberately caused serious bodily damage.
Each of these charges, according to judicial materials, includes the possibility of death.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Justice issued a 22 - point charges, including eight charges of murder in order to demand that the federal prosecutors usually present in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors who described the crime he committed as "surprising, cruel and deliberate," this attack is the result of "responsive planning and premeditated thinking."
Sacrifices by Saifull Hobibulac Saiping caused by trauma, injured or killed were the Diéo Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cláves, Ann-Lora Dekadt, Darren Drake, Arel Erlich, Ernan Ferconsi, Ernan Dígo Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pahukukko, as described in a report on purpose.
Five dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time a capital offense was violated in New York County.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty was carried out in New York City in 1953, a couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of a conspiracy to spy out the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipoff’s court case, a native of Uzbekistan showed no remorse in the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he was not sorry for what he had done.
According to Saiping’s indictment, he was inspired by the authorities to attack the IILA videos he watched on his phone.
The police reported that he also asked for an IIV flag in his hospital room.
He did not find himself guilty of charges for 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by this decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek death punishment rather than accept guilt and sentence life without release only increases the psychological trauma of all the victims," said Patton.
The Syippe’s defense had also asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
The Conservative Parliament’s Department believes that the best - known FARAJA is to be put in charge of the Brexit conferences.
Today, during a protest campaign at the Conservative Party Convention, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the nation's army."
A former leader of the Union’s Independence Union stated that policymakers should “feel the pressure ” of the European Union because one of the parliament’s deputees, Theresa May, offered a candidate to negotiate with the EU.
The Conservative Party deputy Peter Bowon declared on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be done" if Mr. Farage was the secretary of Bexit.
The consideration of May’s problems in trying to reconcile its deeply divided ranks has made it even more interesting that the friends of the Conservative Party, who are fighting the exit, joined the special action of the city against Brexit.
The prime power is trying to implement the Chiquirs compromise plan, despite attacks by the Brexit supporters, those who are against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will not give up trying to deal with Brussels despite her negative reaction, and will force the Euroscrupulists to choose between what she's offering and the hoos.
At Leave Mans Leave in Thessalonica, Mr. Bowon said he wanted to "resist from Chiquers."
He invited Mr. Faraj to step out of the shadow and take responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he were responsible for it, we'd be out," he said.
Parliament's Department of Welllingborough said, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we have to give up Chiquers."
Speaking against the EU, they said, "We have not fought in world wars to conform.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bowon rejected the assumption that after the vote in 2016, public opinion changed, "The idea that the British had changed their minds and didn't want to get out is totally not true."
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to reporters, "I'm just saying, "Precious minister, listen to people.
The Cheques Plan is unpopular among the public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not supported by our party and our activists, who are actually going down the street fighting for the votes of the voters.
Please get rid of Chiquers and start listening."
In address to Teresa May, she said, "The Prime Ministers keep their position when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Farage said that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they're going to give up the decision made on the conference in 2016.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them they won't get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who is going to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We can mobilize the national army of this country to lead us to victory in the Brexit and never rest until we become independent, self-elective, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, opponents marched through Birmingham and then held a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
A few activists waved the Brexit Conservatories after launching a group with these outputs.
Leborist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives because after the summit opened, their party program brought problems of security.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technology needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he said.
"It's a full fart.
There's nothing good about Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning "a serious consideration" of the president's post.
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren said after the election in November, she's going to think seriously about the president's funeral.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the general assembly in western Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about his future.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, is on his second term in November against the Republican Party member Jeff Diell, who was co-head of the Tramp campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as a major candidate that can cope with Tramp in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon there was her 36th meeting with the electorals in the General Assembly format from the time Tramp entered his office.
The assistant asked her if she planned to participate in elections for the president’s post.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and get the government to work, and for that to be the woman in his head."
The suspect was arrested in a basketball gun murder of the LUThers Sims.
In Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, on Saturday, it was reported that a suspect in a basketball basketball basketball player's Wade Sims was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at 11 a.m. press conference in east time.
On Friday, they published a video recording of shootings asking for help to identify the person on it.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot at a campus at the University of Suuterna on Friday morning.
"Wyd Sims was shot in the head and killed," declared police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade went for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result, the interrogation was determined that he was in the scene of a crime, carrying a gun, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Police Department.
Sims, who was six feet tall and six inches tall and was performing in the Jutonic League, grew up in Baton Rouge, and he played 32 games with 10 stars in the past season and played on average for 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds.
Lewis Hemitton reduced the retreat in the fight for the title champion of the world after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Waltheri Bottas left behind Louis Hemitton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottass started off well with a post office and almost passed Hemitton, trying to keep his position on the first two turns, and gave Pied Piper the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to a pit-stop first and left Hemitton on a path in the tail of the race, which had to decide everything.
The Mercedes crew drove another circle, and went behind Fettel, but Hemitton got out after a certain maneuvering wheel to the wheel, which led to a reluctant move of the driver Ferari to leave the inner space because of the risk that was too tight for him, after a double maneuver he managed to get ahead on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferspen started off from the back row of nets and stayed at the seventh place until the end of the first circle.
At the time, he was working most of the race, since he did not change the tires to get to the finish line and to place Kimy Reckonen from the fourth place.
So he ended up with a pit-stop at the 44th track, but he couldn't increase his pace by the last eight, so that Reikkonen had a fourth seat.
"It's a tough day, because the Wallerie was speaking full on all weekends and was showing grace when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an exceptional job to take first and second place," said Hemitton.
The Language of the Body Did Not Affect
On Saturday morning, President Donald Trump ridiculed senator Diane Feynman for his firm stand in refusing to give a letter to Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano in sexual violence.
During a campaign in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Legal Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his opinion of the events in the Senate, which he said showed man's 'subordination, poverty, and lies.'
"The only thing that could have happened, and all the great things that have been going on for the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see the evil people who are showing subliminary, disgusting and lying," he said.
"You look at publications and information published, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It’s not me.”
Do you remember?
Diane Feynman, did you post the information?
Remember her answer... did you present the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I didn’t say it. ’
Wait a minute.
"No, we didn't say it," he added, copying the behavior of the senator.
In July, Feynman received a letter with a detailed statement from Ford against Cavanaugh, and early in September his contents were announced, but Feynman denied that the leaking of information had taken place in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't post information from her," said the Financial Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her objections seemed to be against the president, who was commenting during the Saturday dance, "I'll tell you, her body language was not striking at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone stick to the worst."
Continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual violence, the president suggested that the democracies used charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power in any necessary way.
You see the subduction, the filth, they don't care who gets offended, who needs to be overpowered, to get power and control," -- Mediaite quotes the president's words.
"Dandie Stars" is "Balfast Jamantes," 5:3
Patrick Duyer's game of "Jaantis" dropped two swords in a match against Dundee.
Dundee Stars was rehabilitated for a five-year defeat in an elite league from 'Balfast Jaiantis', winning a Saturday report match with a score of 5:3.
"Jaantis" got an early advantage in two hoibs thanks to Patrick Doyer and Francis Bavier's rods.
Mike Sallyan and Jordan Coony made an account in a home match, and then Duyer took the Jains to the front again.
The Dundee Player, François Bouhart, leveled the bill, and two of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen gave them a victory.
This is the third in the elite league season, the defeat of Adam Keef's team, who got avolved victory over Dundi at 2:1 a.m. on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth meeting of the team during the season, three previous matches won the Genantis team.
The first jack of Duyer dropped it at four minutes (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall Macmillan, and four minutes later Bolivier, who received the show from David Rutherford, doubled the bill.
After the first tense period, at fourteen minutes (13:10) Sally returned the owners of the field to play, and at sixteen minutes, Kouni, when he received a show from Matt Marwardt, reached the bill.
Duyer preferred "Jayantes" to the first break by throwing his second Sabbath at the end of the first period.
The owners of the fields were regrouped, and Buhar was able to double the bill again for twenty - eight minutes when his team was overwhelmingly larger.
Thanks to the efforts of Coony and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, the first time he took Dundee forwards and gave his team victory in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Genents team, which has already lost four out of the last five matches, will play an escape match against Melton Queens.
Air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
Avidinger in Indonesia was declared a hero after he had used his own life to help fly an airplane with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a severe earthquake that caused tsunamis on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong underground tremors continue to ravage the area, and many have found themselves under flooding in the city of Palau.
But to separate from his colleagues who had fled to save their lives, 21 - year - old Antonius Gunavan Aung refused to leave his post at the air - conditioning tower, which was badly lofted, at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jupri Airport in Palm.
He stayed there to make sure that flight 6321 by Batik Air flight, which was at the time on the runway, was safely up in the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was falling apart.
In time, he died in a hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Aeronaviation Service Company, Johannes Siraut, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balicappan to Calimán, which would take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palm.
"We're very sorry to hear about this," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of victims may reach thousands because the country’s natural disaster agency claims that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi, and Botongue is limited.
"The number of victims can grow because many bodies are still under debris and many cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugoro.
The 20 - foot - high [6 m] waves devastated the city of Pálu, where mass burials would take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes deliver relief supplies and food supplies
Rezuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News, "Every minute an ambulance carries the body.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-marts are all over the place."
The chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told the CNNN, "The Red Cross of Indonesia is about to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they're going to find.
It's a tragedy, but things can get worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widedo, came to Palma on Sunday and said to the officers of the country, "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
Early this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on Lombo Island, resulting in over 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: As reported in Air Niugin, after the plane fell into the lagoon, one man disappeared from the abyss.
An Air Force flight in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person disappeared, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crews were safely evacuated from a drowning plane.
In Air Niggini, it was claimed that one passenger could not find a condition on Saturday.
Aviatania reports that her representatives try to find a husband who cooperates with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
In the airline and the U.S. I.A., the plane landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has crossed the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Janes, said that the plane was very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told us that he and others managed to get into an emergency flight on a ton plane by waist in the water.
He told me that the guards were panicking and shouting, and that he had received a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the modernization of the dock also helped in a rescue operation, bringing people ashore by means of a floating boat before the plane sank to a depth of 100 feet [30 m].
According to Aviation Science Network in the last two decades, 111 people have died in airplane accidents associated with PNG-registered airlines, but this list is not listed by Air Niugini.
The Analytic resumed the chronology of the night, in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday the prosecution broke the case against the man accused of burning the Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rollet gave testimony as an expert in the field of operation within hours.
He told the jury how he used records from his cell phone to reproduce the movement of a 29-year-old accused Queenton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night of murder.
Roulette, reports The Clarion Ledger, said that he had received data on location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night she died that contradicted his previous statement.
When the data showed his mobile phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with a friend Michael Sandford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sandford gave a witness and claimed that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was right, when they said he was in the Pispar of Sanford that night, Sandford said he was "more lying because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another incongruity was that Tellis claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Telephone records indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Roulette explained that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he published text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Gale.
The defense should have its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge hopes that the jury will be handed over later that day.
The High Breed: what is a conscious hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop workers wants to challenge the negative view of genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The Hih Breed group from Bristol claims that hip hop changed its nature by turning away from political ideas and fighting to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the beginnings and make a conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as Theuges and Common have recently witnessed the restoration of this directly in the United Kingdom by groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
In New York, a nurse filed a couple for dismissal, receiving a "paracist" notice.
In New York, a nurse filed a couple for discrimination release after receiving an incorrect email from her mother complaining that she was "another black."
The couple deny that they're racist, comparing the lawsuit with the "contestation."
Linsie Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that a new nurse, Giselle Maurice, arrived on her first day in 2016, was black.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she sent him twice, Miss Maurice.
As reported in New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plakson-Flasman felt uncomfortable and released Ms. Morris, saying that their former nurse, who was an African, did not do her job well and that instead she was expecting a babysitter from the Philippines.
Ms. Maurice paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now she is suing a couple for a six - month job of living in a marriage that she was first hired, although she had no contract, and she was expected to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do this," she said, "and she said, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the charge that they were racist, the couple claimed that Maurice ’ release was a wise decision because they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife didn't mean that she sent her.
She's not a racist.
"We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband.
"But would you leave your children with someone who was rude, even if it wasn't deliberate?
Your baby?
LETTER."
Comparing a contest with a contest, Plasco said his wife had a baby just two months ago and she didn't "get it."
"Would you avenge anyone after that?
It's a bad thing," added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still under way, the court has quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticizing their conduct and logic.
As a new letter explains, the publishers of Padington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book agreed to print, said of the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the position of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's funny because we know about the huge success that the Padington story has won."
Speaking of her father, who was a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, he was optimistic that his work had been rejected, and she shared how she felt about the 60th anniversary of the book's output at the same time, because his father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, who she described as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was rather a modest man and didn't like to boast," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child, because when the kids reach something, we're proud of them, although they're not theirs, not ours.
I think that's how he looked at Padington's success.
Although Padington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good - bye to her.
After her daughter landed, she was sent to Louis Pasteur’s 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"There was a regular call, saying that everything was really bad, that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Edna-Lapers.
"And then over called me and said she would die within the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medication given her to keep her heart beating gradually ceased to function and came out of her body.
She died some time before everything was shut down.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn't push, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should have held myself together."
Finally Mrs. Edwin-Laperz, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, got on a plane with other passengers, without regard for the severe trials she had experienced.
"No one knew," she said.
"I lowered my head and could not hold back my tears.
This is difficult to explain, but it was during my flight that I began to have deep empathy for Nadia.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two grief - stricken women leave postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one in suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphres leave postcards on the Wall Bridge with telephone numbers that people can turn to for support and that they can be inspired by prayers.
Miss Davis Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and at the age of 18, he killed himself.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as me every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, who lives in Leaven, told me that her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
"All knew him for a smile.
They've always said that this smile made any room lighter."
But he quit work before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm always afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis made postcards, "so people know that there are those they can talk to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't get locked in, you have to talk."
Miss Humphres, who had been with Miss Davis for many years, lost her 15 - year - old husband, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, that he was depressed or something," she said.
"Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas day, he was completely discouraged, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to survive it, "It's been devastating.
Well, I guess we should go to the family.
But we have to keep on living and fighting."

The future of Bretta Cavano hangs on a hairline: The FBI is beginning to investigate
"I thought if we could get what we asked for, limited in time and character of investigation--we might have reached some agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "revealing" against the ground of the unprovoked loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanano and his audience want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwillingness is related to time.
There's going to be problems in the Republicans in five weeks, on November 6, if you expect them to have problems, it's going to seriously make their efforts to get their own man to the Supreme Court of the country through the election.
George W. Bush called the senators to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who was working at the White House under Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepare their report?
In the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 democracies sitting, there will be a vote.
It's still unclear if Mr. Cavanaugh could get at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, allowing Vice President Mike Pansey to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve of his office as Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Korean passersby has fallen.
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of passersby from North Korea to South Korea was reduced, claims South Korean.
Pac Pion Seung, referring to the Republic of South Korea's Ministry of Uniting, stated that the number of passersby last year was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the key factors were increasing border control between North Korea and China and that smugglers carrying illegals now demand more money.
Phanjanne refrained from public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean passersby eventually offer the citizenship of South Korea.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them run across China, with the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between Korea.
China views passersby as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly reabsorbed them.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved dramatically in the last months.
In the early part of this month, leaders of two countries met in Phanńne and discussed denoglarization issues that went into effect.
This was after a June historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Chen In in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate with the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ree Yong-Ho, in the background of accepted sanctions, accused the U.S. of not making any progress ever since.
"Having no confidence in the U.S., we can't be sure of the security of our country, so there can't be any single-way disarmament under these circumstances," said Rí Yong-Ho in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelossi calls Bretta Kawano "Isterical" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the Palace of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brettt Cavano "Isterical" and said he wasn't up to work in the Supreme Court by temperament.
Pelosi expressed his thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival festival in Ostina, Texas.
"I thought all the time about the fact that if a woman ever did this, she would be called "Isterical," and Pelosi commented on her reaction to Cawano witnessing in front of the Legal Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Cavanaugh was emotionally opposed to the charge of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blazi Ford, when both of them were teenagers.
During Kawano’s opening remarks, Cavano acted very emotionally, sometimes yelling and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the democracies on the committee by calling charges against him "absorbable and coordinated destruction of reputation," organized liberals who were upset by the fact that Hillary Clinton had lost the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi believes that Cavano’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward the democracies.
"I think by these statements, and by his speak against Clinton and the Democrats, he'll be able to do his own candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was indignant when she was asked if she would try to declare the Cavano Impicipment, if his fault would prove true, and whether the majority would receive democracy in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say, "If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only worth working in the Supreme Court, but it's in the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Today, Cavano works as the U.S. Court of Appeals in Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she was concerned about possible decisions by Cavanaugh against a law on available health care or a case called "Row Against Wade" because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings, the question of approval at Kawano’s office was asked by a party to question whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It's not the time for a judge to become hysterical, a biased person and we'll tell him how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women must wield this weapon.
These are just words, which included months and years of rage, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," said Miss Staym in 45 years.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, and you?"
She went on to say, "One woman who worked as an executive director somewhere, who helped me a lot, said that she too was crying when she was angry, but she had her own methods.
But I am evil. ’
And then she just went on.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered an acceptable solution to anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my most fond memories of my first job in the office, where I worked mainly as men, was when I once wept with unspeakable anger, and an older woman, a hostile manager, whom I had always feared for a little while, grabbed my collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an outlaw aboard a boat called the Munkey Busce, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Ms. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for the presidential post.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said to me laughing in 30 years.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate is the last one they needed."
Someone called it "The Whiteman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she kept up her money in the congregation, so she promised that she would not take part in a race unless she had saved $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
She found that some of her adherents, who were willing to support men of $1,000, gave her only $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she was surprised.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration to the system, which made it very difficult for the collection of money and made it easier for the voters not to use as much as the deputees and also to be angry with sexist people, who were ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a breakdown," recalls Ms. Schrader's press reaction.
You'd think Cleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
“ Did she cry? ”
As a trade war between the United States and China, Beijing may be favored
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and even though far from its completion, in the long run, the split between the countries can benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Tramp made the first warning shots at the beginning of this year, taxing basic Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
This week’s greatest situation was this year’s new tariffs on goods cost the total of $200 billion ($50 billion, U.S.), which is actually taxing half of all the goods that come from China.
Beijing was returning the same coin every time, and recently it was setting up a tax price of between five and ten percent of American goods for $60 billion.
China is bound to take similar U.S. action, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to allow that promise to happen soon.
To force Washington to retreat means to comply with the demands, but for President C. C.
But as experts believe, if Beijing can properly take advantage of the situation, pressures in the trade war with the United States can bring China precedence in the long run, reducing the relationship between two economies.
"A fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic decline in any country, and that's actually a greater threat than the observers recognized before," said Abigail Grace, analyst who is dealing with Asia's issues in the Analytic Center Center for New American Security.
The Foreign Minister declared Syria ready to return the refugees
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees to seek help in the restoration of a war - ravaged country that has lasted for over seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, the secretary of state for the Valillus al-Muall declared that conditions in the country would improve.
"Today the real situation has become more stable and safer because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore devastated areas so that people can live a normal life.
Now, all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as one - sided economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their livelihood.
It is estimated that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Muaal claimed that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept help in restoring the war-damaged country.
But he emphasized that they would not accept assistance or assistance from nations that support rebellion.
Europe's winning the Ryder Club in Paris
The European Group won the Ryder in 2018 when the U.S. team won its final score at 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in a suburb of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in 1993.
Europe returned its crown when the crew of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to gain victory over the United States.
The American star Phil Michélson, who tried most of the tournament, went through his first long shot on the 16th foot of steam-3 in the water and gave in to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of four players who had ever passed a 5-0-0 tournament since the beginning of a modern format tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Speth was defeated with a score of 5.4 from the lowest ranking player in the European team of Turbierna Olesen in Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who is the first step in the world rating, has given in to a score of 2:1 Jan Poulter in England, who may have been in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
A Spaniard, Serhio Garcia, who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who won the most competitions the whole time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"I don't cry at all, but today I can't do anything.
It was a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and putting his faith in me.
I'm so glad I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is the team's merit, and I'm happy to be able to help," said Garia after her victory in Europe.
He passes the estafitis to his fellow Jew John Remu, who won the American golf story of Tiger Woods in solitary play with a score of 2:1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a 13-21-3 game record.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 Mahjore tournaments, given only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. fund throughout the weekend tried to reach the festival zone except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf throughout the whole tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fullrick said of his team after a discouraging speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we've been dominating Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll switch, I'll work with the U.S. Golf Association and the Ryder Party Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We cannot fail to commend them.
We lost."
