It's in my pocket.
Tom's interesting to talk to.
She's in the fridge.
He's in the kitchen.
It's ironic.
It's just a matter of time.

There's no point in regretting it now.
It's my turn to laugh.
Now it's my turn to laugh.
It's my turn to talk.
It's obvious that they want to destroy Tom finally.
Clearly, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.

It works.
You'd be the best if you did that.
I'd better tell you the truth.
