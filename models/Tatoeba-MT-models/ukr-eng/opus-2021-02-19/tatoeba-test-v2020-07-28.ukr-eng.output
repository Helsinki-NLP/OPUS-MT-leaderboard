Whose friend are you?
Tom's too tired to do business.
Tom threw Mary the ball.
Tom's pretty persuasive, isn't he?

Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.
Leave me alone.
Aren't you ready for more?

It's unlikely that I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.

How do I get on the other side?
Do we have a choice?
No way.
Let me see.
Tom started to realize what was going on.
Promise me you're coming.
Take off your coat.
He runs to the station every morning.
They're running out of provisions.
Not here.
No one was satisfied.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I tried to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
That's why it's somewhere in this building.
Tomorrow we're open.
I didn't expect such a turn of events.
I think I'll start with a beer bottle.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There must be some logic.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us color our hair?
Were you in the capital city of U.S.A.?

I'm not pregnant.
It didn't break.
I have a question.
There's more to it!
Tom said that Mary was probably still doing this.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The Chief has let me leave earlier today.
What time is it for the end of the world?
I never worry.
How sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I owe him nothing.
Where's your key?
It's gonna be pretty cold tonight.
I'm not gonna ask Tom for help.
How much you paid to do that.
You don't have to stay.
One day we'll meet again.
You said you wouldn't.
It was a long flight.
Don't tell anyone.
I gotta go now.

Tom was not surprised that Mary spoke so well in French.
I know you're here.
It's half past three.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There's no hope.
It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost done.
So we have to be home by 2:30.
Are you going to school on foot?
Is that Tom's girl?
Tom's just wasting his time.
The molecule is made up of atoms.
We are aware of that.
Now is not a good time.
Do you have time to have dinner with me?
I'm sorry he didn't come to see me.
Where do you live now?
Be careful with Bob, you know, he's been through a rough period recently.
Tom married a neighbor.
My head hurts.
Say it again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.
I study English.
Nice weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate it!
You're a little too young for me.
Tom is too old for you.
Tom said he hoped Mary would.
Tom didn't look back.

I'll be back in less than five minutes.
You don't aim high enough.

Tom is disgusting.
It's on Fresse Street.
Tom is your uncle, isn't he?
Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I talked to them.
Has Lucy called yet?
Looks like Tom.
You don't have to do it if you don't want to.
I was about to wash myself.
Enjoy your meal!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do this?
Mary wants me to be on her team.
No one's listening anymore.
You're brave.
You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit right there.
Put it down.
Tom came last.
The handcuffs will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate alone.
You're really gonna find them, aren't you?
I can't stand moisture.
Are you sure Tom's coming?
Where did you get that key?
Can I help you, ma'am?
I don't think I'll get scared.

I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm it.
Mary guarantees it.
I took the wrong bus.
I refused the offer.
Mary had already done what she was supposed to do.
I watched Tom.
Did you keep the table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you dead.
Turn off your cell phone, please.

We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
Tom is unlikely to forget how this is done.
Do you drink?
Tom will do it with you?
Are you awake?
The meeting began at five o'clock.
Mary said she liked doing it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I was in Tokyo only once.
I got an electric bill.
What's the color of his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be okay.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do so.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.

He was standing in the door.
She wept bitterly.

When are you expecting to come?
Tom made his shirt.
Tom went to the library.

She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll bite you.
I don't want any more.
Do you know how much she likes colors?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, I'd be happy to!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It's spring soon.
It speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm pretty naive.
Why would you tell me that?
Let's go back.

I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.

What is he planning?
You're the best!
You ever gonna do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a weird person.

Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The watch's up for ten minutes.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Keep quiet.
The sun shines during the day, and the moon shines at night.
I got on her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have the right to be happy.

Am I making clear?
I'm free this afternoon.
Tom must be punished for doing so.
No matter what, Tom's happy.
There's no need for a hurry.
Are you happy?
At first, I didn't believe him.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Get inside.
Tom could be fined if he did.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really stupid.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary he saw John in January.
You're always getting up early, aren't you?
She's standing up against herself all the time.
They live in the same state.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tom's already in French.
The ground went from father to son.
There are no roses without spikes.
I hope they're not.
Don't drink too much, okay?
Wait for the surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He abandoned his family.
Let's go?
You don't have to contact Tom.
I made a shave.
I'm the boss.
Tom did a good job.
You have to go home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted that he did.
Tom can't drive.
Tom spent that day with his daughter.
Each student has his own desk.
We were ready.
I worry about being sued.
My family lives here.
Tom here.
I got away with it.
Tom speaks good French.
I know I'll learn a lot.
I went to catch fish on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The Uncycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look over there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say that I’m very friendly.
I'm a nerd.
Tom must know something.
That was my mistake, not Tom.
The meeting went pretty well.
At this time of year, the wind blows from the ocean.
I saw Tom smiling.
Come on, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and beat that bully.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I'm ashamed I did.
Do I have to go to the hospital?
In her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings "cantres" music better than any other person I know.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she dresss.
Have you seen his new movie?
I'm good at this.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary's gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My open mind is that this is a terrible film.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's significant.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
Tom has her.
Tom was a barefoot man.
I did my best.
If you see a problem, please correct it.
We tried again, but we didn't.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
The cries of distress do not go away.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom missed dinner.
You speak good English.
He loved his parents.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you'll come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What is this theater?
Have you seen the squirrel?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom wasn't a very good witness.
I visited Grandma.
I hate the wedding.
I heard the sound of the front door.
I can't keep up with you.
It's a great dance.
My home is from Osaka.
I need to relax.
Tom's so lucky.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you get to sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
When Tom's here, do you think?
Is it gonna snow tonight?
Does that sound good to you?
Are you seeing anybody here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate an orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
It's small.
Didn't you know it would happen?
Bad thoughts cause bad actions.
Did you bring the phen?
Tom's fine.
Do you have any money from this bill?
Tom seems a little ashamed.
We can't go without water.
I can't think together.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in a village.
I would never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom didn't waste time with that.
Give me a break.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He was very drunk.
Tom says he's happy.
How are you feeling now?
How many guys are there in your classroom?
These are big apples.
Choose carefully.
I'm coming with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The richest man in the world could not have bought her love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The lack of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers are saving us time.
Do not interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I walk slowly.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll be married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I threw the dice.
The book was short of a few pages.
I picked up a coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks promises.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sarah don't get along very well.
Each student has his own desk.
I spent twelve hours on the train.
I'll be sorry about that.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom doesn't have any thirst.
I learned to milk the cow.
I'm fed up.
Too bad I'm not rich.
She was upset by the news.
I have a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I never killed anyone.
How do you pronounce your name?
She holds the flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man is in his 90s.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
You from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing this, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I take your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom is special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way to rest.
We were ready to attack.
When was the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything about what we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom lied to us.
Tom heard Mary got married.
I've learned a lot.
How much does this umbrella cost?
They're both gone.
What happened?
It can be done.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Tom’s class was infected with the flu.
Remember when you first heard the Beatles?
Tom hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
There's no toilet paper.
The word is silver, silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love that T-shirt.
Drink water from a stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom must still be angry.
I'm going to the airport.
Don't take her whims for granted.
I'm glad Tom's gonna help us.
Tom'll be here any minute.
Glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I'll see you again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I asked her out.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you get to China?
Do you approve of Tom's doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's a perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I've overslept.
How's that my fault?
About Switzerland, have you been there in winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It got better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.
The window opened.
No one thinks that.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom looked pretty sick when I last saw him.
Tom's still seeing Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me handle this with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Grab him!
One of them knocked on Tom’s door.
Tom's such an asshole.
You want some more potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a moustache.
I have three questions for you.
I met Tom several times.
Are you using a word processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot together.
Please move.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, right?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I said hi to Tom.
Tom took his ring off.
I'll fix you breakfast.
Tom listened.
Who broke it in the face?
Your ideas are a bit out of date.
