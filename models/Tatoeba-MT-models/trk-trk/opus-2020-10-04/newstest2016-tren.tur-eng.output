Donald Trump's Accurate Reason 8
Some tried to label him as a burner.
The others smelled him like a joke.
And some are supporting the inner floor.
Some of the Republics try to trigger Donald Trump in the antitypes, but that was still not possible.
The last 11 national antidotes showed him the leader of Donald Trump in two digital numbers, and some start to question the chance of being an empire.
Of course, it's still early in the choice.
Not one of these means Trump's president can win the winner race.
In 2011, the experts claimed that Rick Perry was a cause for prominence for Herman Cain, and both of them couldn't get a vacation process in one country.
And in general, there are many reasons to suffer.
But, like Jeb Bush's Super PAC group and the Economic Responsibility Club, they recognize Trump's eternal power and spend the dollars to break it.
There's a closely period of anniversary results that the emperor doesn't come only for a while:
Trump's preferences changed 180 degrees.
Donald Trump announced his reputation in the middle of June of June, a investigation showed that they had two positive views for the Emperor of the Monmouth University.
It was 40 percent in the middle of July.
It was 52 percent at the beginning of August.
Now six of the Republics have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three of the fucking 10 indicates that they're negative.
And these numbers are watching at the top of the Earth.
The last week, Iowa showed that the Republic in Quinnipiac, where the Republics's 60 percent of the Republics were preferred to Donald Trump.
Three-three of the GOP choices may be pleased with the Trump's day.
The CNN/ORC intervention of the last week, they said that if the Republic of the 67 percent of the Republics would be "concerning" or "tatminum."
Only two of the ten people said, "If it's the same day, they're going to be dying."
It only creates excitingly with I Carson Trump (44%), as we say they're going to be cool.
The other person who's nearest to the coach?
Just 21 percent of oranla Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Repub Bush, who is favorable to the organization, tells us that it will not be mys.
Most of the Republics don't think Trump's miss is a problem.
And when Donald Trump is criticized for the possibility and despised language, the Republics have the right sense to be the president of the President of the ABC News/ Washington Post.
The same number is true in Iowa, according to Quinnipac, the last week, the Republic of the Republics's over 52 percent of his leadership.
According to ABC/Post, the six of the ten of them say he hasn't obeyed the White Saray.
The Republic electeds start to be altogether.
When the politician's politician politician sects, they think Trump's seriously.
According to a CNN/ORC in the last week, four of the 10 people said Trump was the best one to get the GOP week.
It's a change in the end of July after the end of July, from the four of the four men.
Total compulsion: In the past, the cristal cristal celebration of GOPs wasn't clear.
At that time, four of the ten of the Republics thought that Rick Perry would be a festival among the rest of the Republics, and they chose Mitt Romanney only 28 percent of the population.
It seems that most of the GOP selecters still have found Trump's choice campaign.
Even if the Republics were assembled around another week, Trump's still upbuilding everyone.
Some experts indicate that Trump's support is disappeared between a few weeks.
However, a Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that Trump has always received the support of the majority.
Carly Fiorina 13 puanla, Marco Rubio's 14 puanla, 15 bastards of Walker, Jeb Bush, 19 puan, and the last of Rand Paul, John Kasich, and Chris Christie.
With Ted Cruz.
One day that you can get him?
Well, when it's all right, I'm Carson's going through 19 colleagues.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they made their decisions.
A new CBS/NYT a new CBS/NYT indicates that more than half of the choices who support Trump are locking their oils.
Clearly, something can happen to change it, and nobody can really change his mind.
He said they left the door open to change the 46 percent.
Still, Trump's biggest queen is Ben Carson, but the choices you choose to use for Trump.
Ten Republic say that six of the Republic have the same idea with Trump about immigrants.
Since two months ago, the campaign announced by Donald Trump from Mexico, the subject was moved at the beginning and in the center of 2016.
Some think Trump's most talk is that the most important engineering elections were to dismiss them from the Republic Parti, and they're going to lose their marking efforts.
However, according to the New ABC/Post Encyclopedia on Monday, the six of the Republics have the same idea with Trump on the subject of a significance.
I mean, Trump looks like he's staying every day as long as he stays in my day.
The anger of the government goes to the new highest positions.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson, they take half of the Republic votes because of their conditions out of a large place.
On the new ABC/Post in the new AB on Sunday, six of the 10s of the Republics, they ask someone of the government who has experience.
And they're angry with Washington.
A two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa showed that the three of the four prosecutors in Iowa were insulted, and the Republic in 54 percent of the Republics were not "accomplicated" and the 21 percent of the 21 percent of the population in Iowa.

Metcash started the public camp to fight Aldi stage
Metcash, South Australia and West Australia, he's trying to protect the IGA stores from a Aldi attack.
The Market constitutor, Metcash, South Australia and Western Australia, launched a public camp to defend their markets against Aldi State.
Aldi, at the beginning of the year, two distribution center in South Australia and Western Australia and the first to open their markets to 120, the Metcash and IGA commerces strengthen their relationship with local food distributions, and they are trying to make the IGA markets, such as the Adelaide frequency and social media markets and activity.
IGA also shares with faithful clients, such as the Dunsbon capital in the IGA markets, who offers pleasure tests in the IGA stores, and accompanying them with markets, such as Simmo, and faithful clients who sell their southern American football tickets.
On September 29, Metcash is expected to give more details about the security strategy of annual investment strategy.
Risk is big, because the South Australia and Western Australia's IGA cafeteria of IGA's shopping is about 30% of the higher carmars from the east of Metcash.
The South Australia and Western Australia stores are disturbingly, and IGA's people are more powerful than they have acquired in IGA, Victoria, and Queensland, and more than 30% of the GA, who looks at the east parts of the BA, and more than 24%.
But, like Morgan Stanley, the motherlists believe that Aldi's first shopping in this two countries will take about 5% of the markets in 12 months, and the sellers will be taken by the markets in general, but in general, they're taking the baseless bacteria.
In a report published in this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath, IGA's IGA $60 million in one year, and Metcash's end of 2016, 250 million dollars.
This is based on the idea that Aldi's next year will open 30 stores in GA and the BA's next year, and on every Sunday, it will take 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars.
Mr. Kierath said the loss of food and market sales and Metcash's high-purpose capital for Metcash and the taxi and the tax before.
At the same time, Metcash lost his cafeteria in the nearest time that IGA's clients were the most faithful clients.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food and market sales will be reduced in 2016, y3,8%4,1% and 2018, and 2018 will be reduced to 2020% of the market in 2015.
The last week, Magellan Financial Group creator, the leader Hamish Douglass, said Metcash could be removed in a work meal in Melbourne for ten years.
Metcash refused to answer Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it seems that one of the metcash member has been contacted with Mr. Douglass last week.
From 2010 to 18%, IGA has returned to the 18% to 14%, and it has been shown that some 1200 pounds of Metcash’s food and markets have been lost since 2012.
However, the team stands up to the Coles and Woolworths, helping them to renew their $300 billion purchases in the Woolworths, a year for more than 150 million dollars, adds more faster food, and a better special market series to the people.
Metcash's executive President Ian Morrice has started to make the expensive and rebuilding programs and has been waiting for the first time in 2017 to return to the basic cycle.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves much praise for his behavior.
Tennis, according to Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis's friend Nick Kyrgios was on the last storm, and he deserves a lot of praise.
In normal, Kokkinakis, who was a young member of the "Mzel Klers" known as the capital team, found at the throat light of Stan Wawrinka, who was a young member of Kyrgio's young cousin.
The hard-concinnakis and rahbi Ran Harrison said, "Wawrinkin's time, I've got to go over the kid, I'm going to go over the kid."
In the last US Open, Richard Gasquet was supported by Kokkinakis, who was cured by Richard Gasquet, who was ripped off the raket as the last US Open.
Now the young player's running after the end of the British team, Sam Groth and Davis Cup's next to Bernard Tomic.
Healy said, "What I'm feeling so thrillable is that I think it's just a little bit of the municipality."
When he closed and died in the United States, he broke his raket, but he wasn't the first player who broke it because he was disappointed, and I know that the Thana was not enough to be proud of it.
But in fact, in the United States, Harrison and others, he's very well conducted in the most provacative conditions, and I think he deserves to be praised.
There's a great team around, a great family, and I think it's a little bit away.
Although he was 19 years old, he's very mature, and he has a lot of work, and he has no problem with the team, no problem with the other players, he's reverenced in his family's room, he's a hard schooling, and he has a full-wise young and mature young man who deserves to be judged in his own strategy, according to me.
Healy also supported Kyrgios’s decision to be a important partner, and he began to explain that the right thing is to make a "responsive decision" for everyone, but the team was supporting Canberran to return to a long-time iron capital.
Healy said, "We want the team to focus all the magnificently, not on the disputes around [Kyrgios]."
And I say, like Nick, Federer, and Murray, the kid grows so fast in front of the people, and he's getting up in front of the people, and he's awful mistake, and he deserves all his criticism, but we're trying to support him and help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when the spotlights are not in the lights, it's best for him.
The European immigrant crisis: Hungary announced an emergency, closed the borders and overlooked the immigrants
Hungarian was able to cut off the railway for the Saturday, and the south border with Serbia and took care of those who were trying to enter the lawal roads.
Hundreds of hundreds of immigrants formed academic disorder, and the Serbian authorities acted in anger.
The immigrants who fled out of violence in their own lands, set up a tent on the road side of the road to burst into those tents.
But their anger has grown.
When a police helicopter crossed upstairs, the immigrants shouted, "Open the population."
Others rejected the water and food given them as protests.
The Serbian Emperor, Macedonia, and Greece, explained that Macaristan was sent back to the immigrants.
He wants to be part of the solutions, not harming this process.
And Ivica Dacic Pragda said, "The next days, Brussels and other countries will have to be interviewed."
This disturbing situation in Hungary-Siristan was just one day after the 28 countries in the Brusksel meeting of an emigrant politic.
The researchers agreed to share the responsibility of 400,000 immigrants in Greece and Italy, and they hoped that there would be another 120,000 immigrants in the next month or to the end of the year to make a agreement to the AB country.
The headquarters of Germany called Angela Merkel and Austria for a week in the next week to see this foreign crisis.
And Macaristan, it's not hopeful that Brussels or neighbors will take any sort of step on the matter.
In two southern regions, the urgent call of the Saturday is given to the authorities gives abundant authority to fight crisis, such as to shut the roads, and to speed the case of the refugeees.
On the other side, the Governor of the Hungary Commissioner Peter Szijjarto said that he planned to stop the airport from this country with Romania to stop the border.
CBS News Resource Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners were assigned to work between Hungary and Serbia.
For the last few months, the Macaristan has become a circumstance and a circumstance of the European Union, and many of these emigrants have escaped from the wars of Syria and other Middle East.
The chief Viktor Orban, the majority of the immigrants, who came from the war, were completely different from the ideas of “the economictive immigrants ” who tried to move to Europe to a better way of life than the war.
The laws that pass through the night in Hungary are more severely punished by man’s fugitives than by the four feet (13 m) of the serbian border of Serbia.
In explaining the newspapers in Szeged, southern Szeged, government official Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Macaristan government announces an urgent situation because it has caused its movement."
Our idea of something is very clear: the boundary is a crime to pass through the lawless way.
They say that the Associated Press guards in the area have been accompanied with hard weapons and guns.
Orban's hometown security counselor Grugy Bakondi said that the government was caught 15 men who had been in the country who was trying to oversee the bounds.
They've been injured by the dikenlice, and now they have been accused of committing a crime by the police and by the new laws.
The authorities rebuke a quick cripple.
And when the Hungarian authorities shut the two points of the seven borders with Serbia in the Saint morning with Serbia, he also used a traffic train to shut one of the passengers.
It also appeared to the main point in the Caos Roszke, with a small metal contemporaries with the tiny traffic center of people to do the work.
Although 20 people could enter it, thousands are outside.
Other immigrants told them that they would not accept food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary until they hit Serbia and Burkina.
Choice 2016: Hillar Clinton's superiority to Bernie Sanders has reduced half of the national selection
In the old Studies, Hillary Clinton continues two teams in a race for national agency, but you know, Bernie Sanders grows up to him.
Clinton is the second part of the Sanders (%27% of 17) now when the Democracy is falling from 58%.
The President's Helper Joe Biden receives 15% of democratic games.
Within five months before the main race began, most of them said that the Democrat was too early to decide which is the country to support.

After the past month, Clinton has lost a number of democratic groups, and Sanders has some of the wins.
Clinton is a big difference between women and scientists, but it's closed.
The support of men has fallen greatly, and Sanders only follows him in the back of the 5 base.
Clinton's choice of Democrat at 50 years of age has become inconvenient, and he and Sanders are now equal.
But Clinton is a big difference in the aged choices.
The last month, Clinton was walking in front of Sanders with two cages between the liberals, but now Sanders is in this group five base.
In the National level, the democratic choices will support Clinton by being arrested by nearly half of the democratics.
Some 15 percent of the cycle will support him only if it's a possibility.
It doesn't support Clinton.
Maybe in an unbelievable way, Clinton's current supporters are particularly trying to support him with a jail.
The ideas between those who don't support Clinton are even more confused, but only the crown can support him with jail.
As the Democratic Republic said that 48 percent of the democratics will support Clinton with accommodations.
When Clinton was asked why Clinton's supporters wanted to be independent, the first answer was the right experience (in the first century), the time of the president's choice (13) and the best week for the work.
Clinton's supporters also reports his relationship with Bill Clinton.
In the case of problems, there's a criterion and a complicated criteria.
As a president, Democrat's 57 percent of the 57% of the chosen electeds want to see him in the race, but they don't think like this.
When the Democrat is asked about the second weekday choices for the electeds, Biden is upstairs.
More than half of Clinton supports Sander points that Biden can be the second choice.
If Democrat doesn't enter a democratic race, Hillary Clinton has increased his superiority to Sanders, and Biden's no 20 commerce in a race where Bden's not yet.
Democrat is the best chance to get Clinton, the fifth fifth of the choices, but that number has been in the 78% of the month.
Although it was a second to look at this star, it's a mirror, but the percent of those who viewed it as the best of their choices.
And when you ask what is the most important thing in a week, the Democratic choices are standing in front of the choices they can choose.
It doesn't seem like any Democrat or the island that you choose like the last month is acceptable for these first choices.
Democratic holidays or aday party has a good performance in some main characteristics among the first choices of their parties.
Most of them consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, trustworthy, and powerful leadership.
It's strong about Clinton when he was the first time to be honest.
According to the Democratics, Clinton isn't honest and trustworthy, and the half of that is the same as Sanders (15).
Democrats also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in the same way.
In all the measures, there's no idea about Sanders of the Democrat electeds.
In the Democrat chooser, the Democrat has made it more satisfying to explain, and it has not been affected by its views.
But this is a different story in the general American form.
The half of the Americans are not satisfied with his explanations, but only three of them find satisfaction.
In March, the people's views were divided shortly after the problem was taken under the cash.
Most American e-mail controversy has not been influenced by the general views of Clinton, according to 36 percent.
These are generally saying the Republics and more than six people have lost their view of Clinton.
It's still a problem between the electeds of Clinton's choices, even though they are honest and reliable, that is, just 32% of them, just as they are honest and reliable in this number, since the eight base of the month of May, 15 blank was disappeared.
Four percent of your registered choices aren't finding her honest and trusted.
And the 55 percent of the choices in all the country are not found honest and trusted.
But Clinton also has a good note about Trump leadership.
In the six weeks of the test, Biden, Carson, and Bush took the best routes for honesty.
More than that, Sanders often finds honest, but most of them don't have any idea about him, just as in Carson.
351 democratic is the error magnificent of the nuclear margins.
I'm Carson's back behind Donal Trump's national antidotes.
According to the last CBS News/New York Times, Ben Carson is running behind Carson Donall Trump
The new investigation shows that nearly half of the choices of two weeks have been interrupted, and there are no chances of the rest of the rest.
The Government electeds of the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, and the last month, the support of the last CBS in the event in Fox News is at the last 23% of the intervention on Saturday %27%.
But at the same time, the support of Carson rose up to 6% from 23% of the time.
And the Anket also found that Carson's a good way in democratic groups, and the support between the college college graduates is far higher than Trump.
The remaining ones, Carly Fiorina, and Ohio Vali John Kasich, are now two percent of the support of Wisconsin Scott Walker.
The ancient Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the ancient Arkansas Minister Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio is the third time.
In September 6% and September, this was an error of the sin of an agreement with 376 of the Republic selecters.
The last week, the CNN/ORC antialique, showed the support between the Republics in 19%3% of Trump's support.
ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump seriously in front of Carson.
In the past week, Trump, who's going to meet Carson's uppermost pregnancy, has been apologized for Carson Trump's beliefs, but he continues to critical brain surgeon.
On a campaign in Iowa, Trump said, "We need the newerji on Saturday."
Baruch College is accused of the death of his first class.
During Pennsylvania's month in the Pansylvania to accept a brotherhood in Pocono, a college student's death was solved about five years later.
At a starting convention of Baruch College Pilta Psi in September 2013, Chun attacked the "Michael" Deng, and the police contributed to his death.
The authorities told him that his eyes were closed, he was stuck on the back of 30 libraries, and he was always inclined to go to a target in a blue territory.
Mr. Deng murmured that his head was hurt, and later he lost his senses.
Pi Delta Psi members haven't called 911 after Deng fled, and the police waited for a hour before they took her to the hospital.
However, according to the Police Comister Chris Wagner, they changed Deng's clothes, searched his stamps in Google, and asked for an international brotherhood, Andy Meng.
Comiser Wagner said that the Comiser Wagner started covering personal things and putting the kindness of the brotherhood on Michael Deng.
She couldn't be able to move, and she lost her life the next morning.
According to a topsi report, there were travmas of the travmas that brought back to a chest, the head, and the chest, and the captain.
A lawyer named Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represented Deng's family, has lost many families for the result of their acceptance, and since 1970, a few students have lost their lives at least every year.
Brothers and members must be accountable for this, and this is a very important step that the authorities take.
The Maurroe Kasabbay suggested that he was accused of murder for the first five members of the first three degrees of murder.
Mr. Meng, including thirty brothers, will be charged with the revenge of the attack.
Wagner said that in the Tuesday, we will be responsible for the organization, not only those who are involved in the work but also if it confirms it as a picture or an image or a gay official, we will be responsible for them.
Baruch College banned brotherhood, and the national brotherhood ended his relationship with this local man.
What happens when Fed increases their faizings?
The boat's stairs, the stairs, and the economy retains the stairs, and the economy.
We know that.
And what we don't know is how long all this will happen and continue.
History, especially in economy, little information about time.
The return, like the backing of the first facial rate has been done for 11 months, as if it had been a short period of the rest of the month.
Agrescy of the U.S. Merkez Bank was usually marked by economy and financial creativity.
That is why the U.S. capitals are underground, not by the time when the investigation has been increased, but by forcedly highlighting how much the normal process will take place.
It's a real fact that there are different varietys.
But finally, the piano participants may think the transitory rate of the faizing.
The Captain Economical University Julian Jessop clients said, “It is impossible that some of the first fabric procedures of the Fed are in the end of the time of the curricular Economy. ”
On the contrary, we don't expect the U.S. fascinations to come slowly to normally, but it is evident that many of the low levels still are insistent depression.
Still, we don't think it's gonna be influenced.
According to the past trends, the reaction is that some economy can give:
As we have seen in the past months, waiting for the faizs to increase.
The effect will not be so clearly when it's increased.
In a new study, Deutsche Bank's analystlist of what will be happening after the Fed increases, "It seems that it's 12-24 months after the first facility of the banquet, it may be a trenum trenche in the money politics."
According to the current analysts of Nuveen Variable Management, Bob Doll's in Barron's current anatomy, the piece of more than 35 years, and the piece usually records 14 centres and 250 days later, and after 500 days, the normally returning back to 14 percent.
Deutsche said that the actual activity on their senses has become more obvious to the transfiguration in the next stage, and the ending of the destruction.
The return is a truth of the life of the world, but the increase of financial gains will help them.
Fed, in the current case, there are some situations that have not yet been available and that will speed up the restauration.
And the most interesting thing is that it's the lowest level of Fed to increase the gravity.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the multipliation of 119 percent since 1950, in the name year, only two percent of the casual initiative was under 4,5 percent.
Even though the second piece of 2015 has been fulfilled in 3,6 percent, according to Atlanta Fed, it's waiting for a very few, and the third blue is watching at 1,5 percent.
According to Deutsche, it may be dangerous to increase their expenses in such a sensitive economic system, and it could be questioned, "Is this time different?"
For one year, the physician cooperation of Fed's fascination is at the February Open Piyasa Committee, which's going to end on Sunday.
Although most strategy experts believe that the Economist FOMC could confirm this meeting is only 25 percent of the population.
The report says, "In our research from 1950 to 1950, all the results that have been fulfilled, in the thrilling rates of a super-fluential cycle, and the hypocritical gravity of the population, before the restoration starts."
On the contrary, it has become a graduation in the worst of the realm in one instance.
The current registration has been the longest shift of Fed's waiting - 35 months of the longest register, and we've been in it in 74 in 74.
The physician transfiguration has come to a constant state, and it looks like a hypocrite.
Actually, when Fed changes the way the politics change, the activity will be more faster than it's in the wheels.
The first stage of the restoration/surrection doesn't change the transfiguration immediately.
And at the end of the transfiguration, it's coming at the moment when it's done." Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab strategy professors, the increase in the famous increase will refine the transfiguration between cashviller and a shorter period.
We've been in the analogy of cashvilles, often said of Schwab parents Jones, "We're careful about reaching it."
Interestingly, Jones thinks Fed's expectations of politics now.
He wrote, "The power and the enflation of the docs has various signals that the piano has been organized according to the politics of money."
The short procedures are growing, the curiosity of the credients, and the wavery increases - all features that will be seen in the pyjacle when the FED politics are inclined.
On a large scale, most of their works in the United States will be able to increase the famous orchards, and the local products will be more attractive.
The condition of many national companies who have a lot of debt will be worse because the expensive dollars will become more expensive in the world’s purchase, and the debt will be more expensive.
In a report of Goldman Sachs, she said, "The Tatarh, the calculator's sensitivity can live a lower life on the head of a performance."
The companies who had strong powers have passed over to 5 percent of those who were infected by 1994, 1999, 2004, and 2004.
The companies with lowly waves and swims, they traveled in the middle of 3 (4%) in the middle of the higher scale.
It'll be a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies who borrowed a traffic license at the top of the high place are the most damage.
It's pretended that in the capital playing game, the expensives will be able to benefit from $2.500.
Although experts have different ideas about how fast they will be, the chemicals can also get out of high gains.
Andrew Bingham BBC Radyo 3 Classic FM said.
Andrew Bingham's station's advertising.
He defended Radyon as a traffic traffic contracts.
Also, the target of BBC Music Rewards, and he was accused of throwing her Brittenance.
The proxy friend Damien Collins is accused of being unnecessary to The Voice.
A professor who's coming after was pressured to make Classic FM a difference to other commerce stations, saying that the BBC Radyo 3 was "returned" to Classic FM.
Andrew Bingham, the capital, said that the radio channel was "conducting" to their BBC owners, and it was different from the commerce in the guiding companies.
"I don't like to use this tabernacle, but Radyo's 3 "and he's crazy." He went to Classic FM."
And he also showed the target of BBC Music Songs in the preceding February.
Another version of the BBC Music Presentations in the last year, is actually another version of Brit Reports.
Bingham said, "If you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples I think, but you've got it, you're copied with the same thing in the pilot."
The BBC general administrator refused the BBC Radio 3 needed to be a living music, if the people's education can be a public intervention.
If I learn from Radyo 3, I'm not going to go and learn anything about the classic music.
And this is loyalty to a living music, and it's not like anything else.
And he also said that the Radyo's efforts to find new music and exploit the work was also important.
BBC 3 manager Alan Davey said that the radio needs more work to reach more listeners at the end of this year because the British classic music is less educated.
But the Radio 3 Cultural, Medya, and Sport Selecting Committee was not the only identification of the BBC's communion contract.
Tory Damien Collins de O Voe - BBC's building company from the Hollandan Committee to the 22 million music sterline from Talpa Media.
Don't you see why the program brought so much sound, because there's no special difference?
Lord Hall convinced that the BBC1 was made up of the BBC.
He said that before the Common was making fun again, he wanted to find a hit of his blood.
Still, he did not accept the idea that more in the future he had to prevent the sound program from rebuilding or spending a license for other forms.
In August, why the Internet sellers live the lowest increase of history in the Black Cuma?
In the first three months of 2015, a hundred percent of the Internet selling.
The last month has been written for the lowest growth since the rekors started to break.
Three years ago, when mobile devices were used in shopping.
Experts tell us why Kara Cuba's money can be cut off in November.
For over ten years, the trade of the Internet lived in a fragrance, and it turned into a globe of England's most living shopping shopping.

The IMRG trade editor Andy Mulcahy said to the Guardian, "If you look at the grades of the former years and especially 2000, you will see all things to be normal."
Three years ago, when the booters began using their cell phones to buy food, he added that the Internet sales are a large increase.
This means that even when more people are in the arms, they can buy.
But now he's heading down, you can see the fall.
The idea that is taken from the United States is shown as one of the reasons for the trades, the Kara Cua fenomeni.
The experts say that this actual activity on the final Saturday of November may be expected to buy something.
In the past year, with five times more expensive purchases in the activity of the past year, many company sites have been broken.
Experts tell us that the Kara Cuba's purchased "discientity" in order to fight for trade.
The British Perganian Committee showed that each 5 strategy was used to buy a product from the Internet.
Three of the products, like TV and machine, are bought out of the Internet stores.
And more than fourth of people buy their clothes and shops instead of the luxury and luxurious shops.

The authorities reported that 158 people were still cured in the hospital.
The government ordered the 1 million Riyal (17000 sterlin) to pay for the ceremony of the dead family and the survivors.
The other wounds will take half of that amount.
BIRQ tells us that there's the east European ideas that they're working behind this trend.
Veronique Laury tells the British people that they've got more skills.
In the back of this stage, the number of east European catalogs.
As a result, the 200 new Screwfifix stores with the targets.
And Kingfisher also closes the 60 BABQ salution point in the country.
Written: Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Captain
Britishs have been told that they have started to get the skilled Eastern European caters to do their work instead of putting their necks and boats on their hands.

It's time for the U.S. Center Bank FED
The U.S. Center Bank is watched by two daily meetings on Sundays and Thursdays in the entire world, and after ten years, the faizures will not be increased.
They think that more than 80 economist half of our last week, they think that FED will apply this decision, and now they think it's going to be over 0 to 25 percent.
It's a historical event since FED's falling the ranks into zero today.
Peterson, an estimated researcher from the Economic Institute of Economic Unititute, said, "We will first see the capital part of the capital bank and the capital of the faculty. "
According to the U.S. economy, the best performance and the refining of the economy is mounted with trillion dollars and enflation.

The authorities say that Shannon Lamb left a note, after killing his friend in Mississippi in Monday morning, and when he killed his friend in Mississippi, he said that he was the first murder to kill his friend in the same day.
Missipier Gautier was looking for 911 in Delta Eyalet University of the geography and social scientists.
He said he killed someone with a gun.
The Lamb said he should send the police to the officer on the phone.
Guy said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also said that there was a sweet dog in the house, and he probably was sad.
He asked the police for his name, but he didn't say that name.
The Lamb hasn't even explained about murder.
When the police went into the scene, Amy Prentiss, 41 - year - old, found out a note of the lifeless body and a 45 - year - old Lamb, saying, "I'm so sorry, if I could get the time back.
I loved Amy, and he was the only person who loved me today.
The Lamb went to Delta Eyalet three miles (300 km) away and killed his history professor Ethan Smidt, and then the police killed him.
The University Decades William LaForge said that there was a problem between the Lamb and Schmidt, but she said, "Lamb's in mind some things."
While the Kuz's girl's belief that Prentiss was in a emotional relationship with Pentiss Schmidt, they said that on Saturday, the authorities had no information or evidence in their hands that they had no "no information or evidence."
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married for about seven years, refers to Prentiss as "one".
The couple had been divorced 15 years ago, but they had friends.
O'Steen said he had a 19-year-old girl with Prentiss, and she was "intoxicated."

From Manchester United States, Luke Shaw was out for months.
Luke Shaw's right leg has been hurt by the PSV Eindhoven in the championship Lig at the University of Manchester's University, PSV Eindhoven.
This is the case with the eyes of the throat player, when Louis is leaving him in the fields at least six months, he's hopeless he can return to these sezon areas.
In the mid - 15 minutes of the game, Shaw's 20-year-old, fell in a bombing field.
Over nine minutes in the field, and then the oxygen was needed to be sent to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "When you come up, it's broken, and now in the hospital."
Maybe this day or one day it's going to be sent, and it's going to operate at Manchester.
A young man who's transferred to Manchester at 18 years of age will have a hard time, and then make a wonderful game, and then let it come to his head.
He had a oxygen mask on his face when he was in the lake room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you're broken from the couple, that's at least six months, and it means you can't play in the group universe.
I hope this sezon can play again.
Moreno was lucky to escape from the red card and the penal.
Hume Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaaln claimed that Italian was a mistake.
You can judge yourself when I tell you that it's a pencil and that's a red card.
It was a very bad fight with two legs.
The tweet of Shaw's account said, "Thanks to you for your interviews, not to tell you what kind of disappointment I have been, but now my way of recovering is starting, and I will come back with strength."
Points: Luke Shaw's suspicion of Manchester U.S.A.
The championships in the next July will be comfortable to make the British defense player.
PSV technical physician Phillip Cocu said, "Don't be so bad."
It's all sad if it happens to any player like that.
It's not the intention of our players.
Moreno, he also had his leg broken in a Mexican team at Van Gaal's Hollanda in 2014.
Cocu, it's hard to find this situation, because it wasn't hard for me to have a cure, and it wasn't good after I heard that it was a terrible disappointment.
It wasn't possible to see that memory in my mouth.
The only thing I could see was the ball that went into different ways, like Moreno touched him, but I didn't see Luke's ball.
The SBS 6 says, "I know how a feeling is, and I know how difficult it can be.
I feel so bad for that, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado was taken to the hospital for the war she entered in the PSV.
Of course, David Cameron The Lorax knows better than that?
It's a short time for every parent to learn that when your child loves a book, you know you're not going to have enough time to learn about it.
I see if you're not David Cameron.
When a recipient asked the capital The Lorax, the 1971 graduation of Seuss, the capital.
Cameron says that this is a hard decision on the SuperCamps company's web site, and he says: “I like to read this book, which is a composite, impressive, creative, and powerful message, because it has always been a sign or message to my children.
Everything was so good that Cameron wrote something about the milk of the book, but actually, it's the book of the new characters and details that adds to the contents of the text of the original text in 2012.
In Thneed-Ville, a kid's name is a child in Thneed-Ville, which has not existed in the weather, says the real name of Thneed-Ville is a child who wants to see Audrey's heart, and the real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If this doesn't have any suspicious suspicion for you, the text that Cameron took on the Internet film is very similar to the short text of the The Lora film, which begins: "The city of Thneed-Ville, a child who wants to win the heart of a girl named Audrey."
According to the idea that Cameron was a mother, the unnamed young man named Lorax is a bottle of the local neighborhood, the name of Lorax, who has been called the name of the name of the name of the name of the local, and the name of the book.
Probably, the work of a corresponding people with that kind of corresponding, a command servant, and he seems to have not read The Lorax over 20 times.
A woman of the president's president said that the text was from Cameron's choice office.
SuperCamps confirmed that Cameron was given the text, but there was no comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger to get out of England, but I'm still tired.
It's hard to play with Pakistan in the United Arabian Empire, but I think there's no way to be defeated by 3-0 test serials since we saw the selected English team for the Turk.
But I can't leave a deplasman's capability.
Alastair Cook's team may be more inexperienced than three years ago, but there's a traffic players who have improved in the shot line, and a powerful game, which doesn't heal 2012's wounds but only a few youth sources.
In the play, the Moeen Ali player, and Adil Rashid represents a ancestors, even though he does not know the quality of the test level.
Points: Adam Lyth team of England, and instead Alex Hales was taken
Adam's decided to take Lyth, it's hard for me to take care of me as the head-generator in Yorkshire.
The seven test was against two good ancestors in difficult conditions, and the simple, but the fact is, they are judged according to the conclusion of the criteria.
For example, Joe Root did not have a question about it, and he remained in the field service, because as I had said, the best of the players were their own choices.
He could see Lyth's career, after a few electronic series, but he appointed his own capital.
I hope he'll get another opportunity if he works more for Yorkshire.
Trevor Baylis, the chief puncher in England, hasn't seen the best performance, but he praised the player's attitude, and it didn't surprise me.
It's hard to answer the question, how long a testist will take a note.
Lyth - Sam Robson had seven knifes, and Nick Compton took nine from the other side.
Just Compton's lucky luck.
The only number you can feel is Jonathan Troatt may first go to the Karayips at the formula.
Alex Hales comes and I think he's a highly shooter.
A criteria in the X-factor, and we saw it in Yorkshire when Trent Bridge at the front of this sequence, when he counted 236.
At least he should be taken to the same opportunity before, but that's exactly the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea that Moeen's holding the fourth, so he's going to get the player to get a lot of players with Cook, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a shot can't shoot here, and this left-down catch has already shown how good it's.
Moeen couldn't have done his work for Worcestershire, but he saw three numbers for them, and he couldn't make a lot of differences.
My old team friend, Justin Langer, played his first graduation in 2001.
Three fucking slides were closed and he didn't look back.
Zafar Ansar came to turn the colleague player, and he was surprised as a young man with whom I had been dealings with him.
Humans can see their statistics in 31 mediums and 35 centers in the hit, and they think it is a degaj, but there's not a lot of players, and it's made by the age of youth of the player.
This is going to learn a lot of things in this type.
A far away from the team, it looks like a few crafts plugins in England's team.
Sri Lanka shooter Mahela Jayawardene may have been a great predicament to consult for the testing games.
One of the favorite men of that game, in every situation and all ancestors, will bring with him an experienced experience.
Paul is coming for the white foot of the Collingwood ball, and he makes a rude series of energy and game order.
I always thought he was born for the international criteria, or the player, and he has a way to guide, like Mahela.
At times, new sounds in the ceremony room, even if they were previously told messages, the team can bring up a new team.
Colly's team Ben Stokes is relaxed for a daily game, and I have no problem with it.
Everyone doesn't have the same idea, but the plans, the targets, and the players are not designed.
And you should remember, like the players, their work depends on the results.
It's not always easy to make such decisions.
The economy can win the Brexit camp until 2017
David Cameron's half-friend strategy to hold Britain in AB is worse every day, and it's going to be more bad than Jeremy, "Yes, yes, yes?" or that is when Corbyn's employer party was chosen to be picked up on the Tuesday of Europe.
The foreigners have Corbyns and Nigelages.
In recent years, a European diplomatic diplomat said that some members of the United Nations have been infected with various crisiss that they do not want much, and Britain's only participations and rival agreements are disrupted in my day.
TUC decided that he wouldn't want to harm social security at the annual meeting in Brighton.
We could even call it the personal day of Dave and George.
Prime Minister and Shansyl said that they're taking their pictures to refine their country, not in the capital capitals of foreign countries, and that they are going to have their own photos, no matter what they may have been in the front of the capital of the country, and then they've returned to their country to refinement.
That's all about me.
When Berlin said, "Don't leave us alone with France," my friend of European Britain who asks for an outward Britain in the AB tabernacle said that a shorter view of the capital of the capitals, and the authorities have made a point that they don't expect to stay.
In Germany, the luxury of lucky Angela Merkel, who has been with him for ten years, and he wants to leave the situation, like Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollanda, François Hollanda, faces the re-separation or extra changes in France in 2017.
He's a soothed power.
Soon a national government will come from the left part of Poland, and there will be a solution from the left part of Spain.
Selfie, who should use his energy to prevent Selfie from leaving the United Kingdom, doesn't mean that they do not want it, because they do not want it, for most of them have a participation tendencies.
I mean, some of these looks may plan to speed the Brexit process in the 2015 U.S.A., the U.S. Party of the United Kingdom.
"It wouldn't be a renewed discussion." And he did not get anything that would help the Britanya re-revolution.
The Europeans knew how desperate Fleet Street was in their previous experiences, the AB opposer of the capital base bars in Tony Benn's time, and they weren't like that, which confirmed our entry in 1973.
They remember Boris Johnson, the Bruksel Resource in the early 90s.
All the stupids, Ed Milibands knew who their enemies were.
Among these are tax officials, foreigners who listened to the lawless phone, and many of our large newspapers.
Tony Blair was often thinking about the same things, and when he remained in a coffee in a coffee, he realized that he had to give him a knife in the lunch and to avoid eating at lunch in the afternoon.
Actually, Miliband was Blair from Cameron's flairer, because Blair gave him the French and Hollandan's votes on the AB's home in 2005.
The press has never forgiven him about this.
But on Sunday Westminster, when I told him that there is no time for me to lose her, Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnnock, and now in the 80s of those who are just a mistake.
He needs to develop a strategic strategy to be in contact with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC council on Sunday.
I'm telling Corbyn's image in Europe in a kind of upbuilding.
He says he wants us to stay in an AB.
Many of the people who have been out of hostility in Ukkip and the Muhafazakar little supporters of England say yes.
That's what Hilary Benn said in this week, but not Bennite, because it's a bad idea to make Corbyn's radio and television this week, because he forced himself not to admit that Corbyn's John McDonnel is a bad idea to make him a shadow.
This reminds me of his father’s industriousness against his friends in the television in the 70 ’ s, and he lost his position in the grave.
Hilary's fight was more interesting.
But with the word of Men, it was the same as what McDonnell said to the McDonnell, or the special meeting of JC on Sunday night.
And if we think that Corbyn's touching me, he still keeps the message in the social media in which he's trying to report, no matter what he's going on, whatever he's trying to tell, 7/24 TV, and casual paranories and treachery.
As McDonnell said, it's all right to make it difficult for the worker participation in Cameron.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks like that.
But it's not just a common argument between McDonnell and Corbyn's AB membership, Bennite's Economic and anti-cappialist history, which is not just one of the southern religious opposers.
As in the nato transition, Tom Watson will be determined not to make the campaign to leave -- they will have to try to get a man for their masters in the land of foreign diplomatics.
When they have a suspicious choice, Paris or Berlin, why do they lose the politics of Britain's privileges that all can be freed?
On Monday, I was told that the British Ethiopia Security Forum was already disappointed because the Anglo - the Anglo - Population Parti government of the United States, despite the expert Party, England, Irak, Libya, and Syria.
Experts critically criticize England's Common Health Expectation
The researchers claimed that 12 people who have contacted with a cigarettes in one of the 12 people at a meeting of cigarettes are less harmful than 95% of smoking.
In the British Medical Responsibility of the British Professor Lancet, the British Professor of Camu health (PHE) reports about the Agency (PHEE).
PHE published the report of the "delils in a detailed scrutiny" in the past month.
But some researchers questioned the truthfulness of data and pointed out the connection between some experts and cigarettes.
In the past month, Lancet typical capital, the head of PHE's analyzed conclusion, has made the "dessert base" on the main conclusion of PHE.
And two other researchers written in BMJ questioned, "Is it a person or a rock built?"
In London Hijien and Tropikal School, a professor of European health Professor Martin McKee and Liverpool University Professor Simon Capewell said, "It is the basis of the principal testibility of the principal politics."
They said that PHE would be expected to have a detailed study of the evidence and a detailed study of the verbs of the E-sigara cigarette.
Actually, a critically critical criteria (MCDA) has been out of the 12 members of a gathering to improve the modes, and the results of this meeting is in an article of study article.
McCee and Capewell said that one of the main sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, an independent research from British American Tobacco.
They also said that the BAT has also confirmed the publical medicine document.
The 12 men at the meeting said that one of the 12 men was getting funded from a e-gigara generator, but they added that Philip Morris had not been taken from the International cigarette company.
There was no information about how the panel members were selected, but among these are some of the known patriarchs, including some of them, mentioned in the article.
Other people who are ready at the meeting are not known by their cigarette control of tobacco.
The cigarette was also involved in the meeting in PHE.
McKee and Capewell said that the account of the team's study article was "in a kind way" and "a lot of criteria" is lacking in a lack of imagination about the harm of most products.
But none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in PHE report.
MCee and Capewell said, "e-sigara doesn't have any evidence of getting cigarette for children or cigarettes."
Prof Kevin Fenton in PHE said that the prosecutor of health and prosperity was previously recounted in BMJ.
He said, "Escapes are less harm than I'm getting cigarettes."
One of the two people who have a cigarette for the rest of his life dies because of this habit.
All the evidence indicates that the risks of health risks are small, but we need to keep studying long-valuable effects.
PHE has a clear job: during a time of chronic, chemical skeleton, in a time of chronic disappearing about the harms of the evidence and not.
In a year, some 80,000 people die from a cigarette, and the smoking of smoking costs NHS two billions a year.
We do our national mission, even though the e e-gigara is not safe, is clear to show that only a small part of the damage that it causes a smoking.
The previous Channel 4 Chief said that BBC should leave EastEnders.
The former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson BBC said that the programs, such as EastEnders and The Voices, should stop the programs, and the relaxers, such as the Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license was to be used only to make programs that were not available by other English literature.
He criticized BBC for ceremonial service programs against the most magnificent reying programs, which may not have to be watched by a little monitoring group, such as BBC4.
After the BBC's general director Tony Hall told us that he wanted to join more organisms with other organisms, Johnson says that this was in his own time of six years in his time to make a relationship with BBC.
Johnson, during a question about the future of BBC, said to the Lords Committee, "I am fighting the plan of programs that show the BC's clear propisodes and translates."
If you're not sure that I'm a good idea, or long, the licens pay, at least the release should be transmitted to the programs that nobody doesn't do or do what others do.
The Voice is distributed between the primetime, because they want to help as much as I can.
The main idea is based on the idea that nobody could be published, that's funny and openly dirty.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why the programs that can be buried without help should be buried with a tax.
The Voice's one of the EastEnders is being made in the company.
The other channels will give their right hands for that.
I'm trying to see how the public service is.
I don't think that's going to reduce BBC.
Jonson, who ruled Conduct 4 from 2004 to 2010, was accused of getting the best way of reyting the BBC to confirm the condition of the people who work in here, and because this workers are the best way to confirm this province for the long support.
Sky manager Tony Ball's comments are repeated in 2003 to offer BBC to sell his programs like EastEnders.
Johnson BBC is going to BBC4, but it's not a spectacular service program, but it doesn't take it to the bBC4, but it's a recognition of the tax experiment, and it's possible that they can continue to show the four billion sterlines in the payment. He adds: "We're going to do all these dynamic programs that nobody does not see."
They put these in spaces that nobody ever watches.
Concerning the license, Johnson said to the Committee, "I invite you to find a more regressive system than those who are best useful from this.
Of course, you all think, we all think about 150 sterlin, but I'm wondering if they're a lot of BBC's doing that for the people who have a lot of money in the year.
Also, the former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein of the former Sky and Conduitary Committein said that BBC should be reproduced with the "public, Education, Education, and fun."
He said that some of the BBC's output was now graduated as an artificial education -- that the TV output and the radio was 1%0, and the public service in Australia and Canada must be changed for it and should change it as a "punishment, illumination, and teaching."
Elstein said that the BBC should do only something about promotions, and all of them should be interacted with their team collaborators.
It allows you to control your brain cells by the sound waves
The video sees how they're hit with sound cycles.
Scientists have developed worms that can't control the genetic systems that were changed by the sound waves.
The little tiny straws change the way they hit at a quick speed with sound cycles that people can't hear.
The trophys are running through genetic motor cycles which are changed to the geographic cells that were changed to answer to the waves of sound waves.
Possibly, researchers read the brain's active feature with light
Scientists said that the pottogenetic is a new procedure, which can be used for a number of ultrason brains, heart, and clot cells to act out of the body.
The researcher Sreekanth Chalasani Guardian said that one day this Processor of Parkinson's curricular intervention, which can take place in the deepest smoking of human brains to heal people's diseases.
The captains often don't respond to the voice, but Chalasani found how they responded when they came around with a microscobic pool.
The trunks that he finds are upbuilding the sound waves, and it makes them pass through the trunks.
The powered sound waves affect the buildings of TRP-4 pounds of some curtain cells.
According to a report published in Nature Communication, the sound waves contribute to the opening of these continent channels and activating cells.
To create the controlled curtains through the voice, Chalasani changed the geometry as genetics in order to make some neurons carrying the TRP-4 Ionian channels.
When the sounds were changed to the creative creatures, the sound waves were strengthened by micro-cabarers, and they were sent into the curtains, and the motor neurons were transmitted here.
This procedure has similarities to the optogenetic, which enables scientists to run and shut down the neurons and neurons.
But Chalasani's possibility could be some experts on this technical.
Unlike the light needed to be sent through a optic trunk in the brain, the low frequency frequency sounds can pass through the waves, and they can be sent to the brain over the head.
Chalasani said, "We believe that human neuros in the clinic of a certain neurology can be cured by a gen therapy and a healing virus."
He also adds that other applications can be involved on the cells and inciulated cells.
You've got a lawless team in your door!

Points: DSEI guns: Governor regimes attack in London
But a different campaign continues with posters in the bus stops and in the metro trucks, and it needs to be watched twice.
In one of them, using London Metrosu's fonts and markets, he says, "You're going to travel to the predetermined field in 190R between September 15,18."
This September, a gun sellers are going to attack the top of DLR, and the clients are asked to help stop this gun.
The 300 poster is the artists who performed in the Dancesmaland of Bansky's Studies in the Museum of Bansky.
Special Devrie Grubu was a Colectant, 6 ◆, and it was said that the three-thresholds of the bus stop in the gateway can be accessed to one three-three of the adventure areas in the currency.
For London, it wasn't pleased with the "augency" for London.
One of the reklams was created by a special Devrie group.
According to the Esax University Escex University, artist Greendon, every day, they're curious and looking for the politics to move the politics outside the gallery.
Many artists are working together in protesto movements, and they see that their arts should be born into the real world so that their art should have a effect on the community.
The other gun traffic is going against the passengers in the medium.
The video of the International Office was seen over 100,000 through 24 hours in Facebook, and it was created by a free VCCP relaxer, and they were prepared with a graphic designer.
VCCP creator Matt Lever was so surprised that the guns were not silent against their relaxation -- and he thought, "Let's give them to a campaign they're trying to escape."
The fact is, they played with the idea of making a chemical relaxation, but they were attracted by colors and animation.
Tom Davies from the Apologization said, "They have been a great help to create a lot of concern about the disturbing teams in the Fuar."
Now, the England government has been forced to stop selling the revenge teams outside our door with lawlessness.

Eight gold rules to live in the students' homes.
A 19-year-year-old student has been moved to their homeland for 11 years, and I still believe in ceremonies and morality, but now I understand the smilings that I've never done, and I don't understand how many of the longs I've been doing.
Most of what I'm learning can be composed by the eighth gold rules.
Moveing in the land can be as scarlets as if it were completely scared.
The creativity of the ship is where it's going to lose people, where you've lost a year, and why don't you love Marmite, because the boys are really in my room.
Take a breath.
And let the others take one, and ask questions and show you the point.
It'll guide you to this talk and help you to separate your favorite people you're not talking to.
Leave the people a little.
People's rooms often turn into their drinking respassions, in the cycle of the night, and in the celebration points, but these are also where people are dressed and putting their inner hairs.
Point: Don't even think about starting with a relationship to university.
Inner locusts are treated badly at university.
Your room may be a place of indulgence, but many homes corresponding cultural culture between the rooms, and this friend's living, social and life.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to save this energy.
Nothing in the center will allow you to say, "I like you, and I want our friends to continue, but I need you to go, so I can put the energy I spend with you."
Try to notice that your friend's tired of social interaction and maybe stole the door instead of playing the door.
When you said to play the door, do it.
One of the students in his home was a politician, if the door isn't locked.
He saw a lot of things.
Don't make friends with the coffee.
Since you started to college in the college, it's less weird to get people's doors with a crap brown, and less than 1950 people, "Welcome to you, I'm good for you, and I'm going to laugh at you when you ask personal questions."
It's a wonderful way to make friends for people to offer a house-hour.
Your family friends are forced to talk to you and maybe they'll have your face with a sweet surprise.

Check the master twice.
He'll tell you to look at your own head, even if he maybe.
Someone's stole their belongings, and I understand you, but try to start with it as matureer than my homefucker, and he puts the shit to punish the pit.
He's now in prison.
Don't scream people to sleep or to work.
This doesn't mean being just a proper person, but you're the coins in the center house.
A girl in my corridor said to a neighbor on the side of my corresponding side, and he said that the night was three of the night, and he was a test.
The answer was even more open.
When they finally closed at the end of the morning, she opened his music to the last door and allowed them two hours to sleep in his own test.
Wouldn't it be romantic that your next wife moved to the same corridor?
In contrast, it's amazing that you're supposed to misunderstand a corresponding friend and feel that you're your future wife, you've got to hang, and you've got to see her every day, and you have to be taken captive to your associates.
Of course, that's the heart, but if your fierce corridor isn't your future mate, at least suggest that you talk to him and make sense.
When you see someone's left the keys in your awesome memories, you know, it's better than you think it's the line between the pocket and someone to be oppressed.
It's a good joke, but it'll take time to get back.
You can make a valuable lesson about security, but don't disturb anybody's room with the bottle and teeth.
Capture your doors and put your keys in a barrel, but don't put their things in the cake twice.

Petrol companies have fallen down.
From 2014 onward, some 400 billion dollars to the end of the last year, the most deep sea (deepwater) search projects were banned.
According to Wood Mackenzie’s research of the prosecutor Wood Mackenzie, the low rate prices, petrol and gas, which caused a 380 billion $10,000 project in Mexico to produce a largely cognisation in Africa.
The biggest reason for the maternal contracts, in 2014, when $1.5, 70 percent lost in 1.5 years, and a report shows that the pertol frequency of 12 years was broken down in a dramatic budget.
REGULAR PIONEER 400 MINISTRY
Ham petrol prices every day were new assumptions every day, and the last 12 years she saw the lowest level of the last 12 years, and he returned under 30 dollars.
"Petrol's falling into 15 dollars"; "Petrol is fired over water" the energy investigation company of Wood Mackenzie, published by Wood Mackenzie's investigator, how the finances were affected by the expense.
The report that he published in July shows that the $200 billion dollars of $200 billion dollars have resulted in the summer $2 billion of the great energy payment, Wood Mackenzie, and that the number was reaching until 2015.
According to this, in the last six months of 2015, 22 large projects were delayed, since the storm of the capture began in 2014, the 68 large project has been registered.
These projects are worth some 400 billion dollars.
WE LIVING 2.9 MILYON VAR
In a study that highlights the effects of low petrol prices to the company plans, the most impacted projects are the deeper procession projects.
There are 27 billion procedures in the casuality of the war, which has been delayed until 2025.
According to the research, many of these projects have been distributed in 2017 and later delayed back to the end, and the first production purposes of 2020 to 2023.
In between 68 projects, the next five years, the estimated 170 billion dollars of $170 billion $170 billion $170.
And that's why it's too high for the investment.
The 70 percent of the sea’s expenses are made first by Nigeria, Angola, and the United States, in Mexico.

In IRAN
In fact, four years ago, there was a picture of the U.S. and Europe: Iran and Europe brought an ambargo to stop the nuclear program of Tatra's nuclear program, which was about 110 years old, and Iran was discussing how the peerril freaks would be cut off in the cash.
When we go back to this week, we see a different journal.
For the first time since 2004, Petrol's prices saw the gold of 30 dollars, and the main reason is the production of the United States, and the ambargos resumed in Iran.
That's why the eyes are on Iran.
If Iran's increased the petrol cake, it's gonna be more traffic to the piercle market.
And this could cause us to get down the expensive levels today.
Some analysts say that Suudi, who doesn't want to take a market to Iran, would have more petterer pomps and that there may be an expensive war between Iran - S.S.
Constructions do not keep up, and Iran's main goal is that the capital market of Asia is in India and the old partners of Europe.
The Iranian officials said that they wanted to increase the first capital of the capital for the first day, and then a little later, they had to do more than that.
According to Reuters's Maps, 22 episodes in Iran, waiting for a lot of casual pectors (VLCC), full of 13 or large.
Iran is in the country where the fourth of the world is confirmed.
By means of the building strategys, Iran eran, some 1 million people in Turkey's country.

We see that in China, the largest populator of the world, the economy's economic decrease in China, the fear that the population of peterol will be reduced to 20 percent of the world's population.
In addition, we may be witnessing the prices under the next day under 30 dollars.
As long as we don't see $32-33, the $33 will be limited in the petrol move, and the pressure may increase.
In this point, the critical $30 degrees have a key role in helping the falls to continue.
In this case, it should not be surprised to see the influential decreasing of 23.30-25.60 support areas.
Isham Sardouk: "The angel's system is over now!"
Why did you turn the rota to Turkey in the WGSN's Secret and the world's population?
- I'm always on the change.
I was born in Paris, I lived in London, then I went to New York.
I've taken some important positions there.
At that time, I've started to give Koton a consultation for the last two years.
And then I saw the possibility in this geographic and the coton mark.
I realized there's everything needed to be a store in the world's world.
Now I'm here to do that.
Can you do it shortly?
- Absolutely.
He's already a young market, but he's sold in 50 countries.
We're making 50 collections a year, 15 sections.
I mean, there's everything to have a store chain.
From Dubai to Moscow, we can respond to the needs of the experts in different geographies.
Now we're making a store in Paris in March, and that's the start of a new and exciting period...
Do you have to open a store in Paris?
- Yeah.
It's not because Europe's economic condition was fun.
But you open some stores for the imagination.
Paris, you've got a shopping captain like London, and you win the money from the Middle East.
One is a markacle president, the other cash, and both of them need a mark for the world.
Well, let's talk about the trends...
- There's a lot of romantic sezon in front of us.
Fleshon clothes, soft tons, white, red.
Process...
We're passing through so hard and violent times, and the moda world is always trying to make a life happier in these difficult times.
That's what we do.
That's why the new sezonda's coming back.
Let's go back to your years in Victoria's Secret.
-Carolina Kurkova.
I'm just not talking about your wonderful physician, so good girl!
He sat with me when I was working, and they fucked me with hands, saying, "Mother, are you hungry?"
That was so sweet.
You know what I'm talking about, and you've interviewed all Victoria's secret model.
How beautiful Carolina was, isn't she?
But Adriana Lima was very impressed by her beauty.
- Yeah, yeah, that sound!
He's talking, he's tonight...
You're going back to man after a while, and you say, "Stay on a side and look beautiful, don't do anything else."
He's insulting.
Right, that's a suspect.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
He was the most beautiful girl I saw in my life, but I was afraid of his emptiness.
- That's most of it.
The new angels aren't the old one...
I remember Gisele's time...
Actually, it was hard to work with him.
He's coming to the club, he's drinking cigarettes like a fish.
It's not the same as the Tyriac.
Nobody can drink or he's the only one!
Maksat'diva.
Two months ago, Victoria's Secret defile, took the lowest rating of his history.
Why do you think?
- As I said, it's over now the time of the famous angels.
I'm sorry, who's gonna do Gigi Hadid?
What's good?
Kendall Jenner, like a throne...
I don't have a sharp, nothing.
Kate Moss is zero, but it's the biggest name of the moda instrument.
- Yeah, but his face was so beautiful.
I want to use my critical rights here.
I've interviewed last year, a face fell down...
- That's so cigarette, drink, now it's locked.
But there was such a beautiful face in the docks.
Their lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
That was the end of that supermodel period.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell's period of Christy Turlington...
Christy was my close neighbor, and I've seen it in a nonsense every morning.
It can't be like this.
What about Cara Delevingne?
- She's losing herself.
Not in every campaign.
People are tired.
There's no hungry starvation for the old models, celebrity.
People want to see the real faces, like they're in the camps.
We'll go on this.
Because it's the trend.
A letter from the 25 writer to Turkey
According to BBC Turk, the International Authors of England (PEN) and the Presidents in England, Galler, and Scotlands are also among them; they said that in Turkey there was a part of the threat of threats, the newspaperers, and the colporteurs, and physical attacks.
Two attacks in Turkey were made to target the Criterion newspaper in Turkey, as well as the Koza colleague and Vice News reporters, and arrested in the newspapers, and arrested with concernful developments.

The corpse is made in the mirror, which is performed in the low-style of the base.
In the high base, there's only the amount of water to be used and the transfiguration period.
It's the best example for this.
Especially to cook foods, such as pigs in the diamond menus, we must first have to wash the grass and then wait for them to put it into the rubbish.
A deep body is filled with water in a three-three, and this filter is placed in the body.
It's gonna be left in the light of the creep.
So it's possible to get out of the beach out of the body.
The fire will first be lifted up to the highest level of water, and then the fire will be restored to a lower level.

David Bowie - Blackstar: Space's "son" album
You know you're going to die, that last album to do it to make the end album, to make the dead bed, you've got the klipte a artistic expression...
That's what we're doing; we can look too much for world fanatics.
I say the world fancies, because I'm really among those who believe that the person who does that is immortal and a space.
It came from the other corner of the universe, and now he returned to his homeland.
'Cause Kiss, Marilyn Manson, or Lady Gaga, there was a spirit that would be given to all the world artists.
He finished his mission right.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes: 9.99 TL5/5
Probably was fed from Warhol from the same planet, Kubrick.
When Apollo arrived at the 11 Moon, he decided to say, "I'm so far." And he interrupted with us by saying "Space Oddity".
Actually, he wasn't involved, and he's always got a few steps ahead.
Many have found lost paths for him.
And the musician listened...
If we're going to take care of Plastic artists, it would be unfair for the music.
The characters of those who walk from the song and who have created it, and their votes, the votes, the votes, the capital.
I can't know what a glam Rock's dad, neither the punk's cousin...
If I understand that, what happens to the e-mail movement that he has been hiding as love since he's childhood?
David Bowie was reminding us of what the word we had stored in our mouths for the years.
He wasn't a man, not a woman, not "insan."
It was a body.
We've been seen for a train.
That body, 26, was released from the world two days after the "Blackstar" studio album.
Album tried to make us get into the "Blackstar" and go with the "Lazarus" before we heard the album.
We thought, "He's old, he's speaking about death." He knew everything.
Another last game...
It's amazing to say that the number of songs we know with the number of the songs we know with the "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" and "Lazarus" are re-easoned for this album (Or A Season Of Crime), and the number of songs we know with the "Tis A Pity She Is A A A"
I'd like to tell the rest of the people, "I can't give her Herthing Away" and "Doll Days" are good songs.
When we look at it, it's a very powerful musical structure, but it's so hearty, like "Blackstar."
It's not death, nor "Continue" album...
It's just a real "son" album.
It's the record of the 'The End' of music at the end of the beginning.
In Sultanahmet attack, Turkey's goal was taken
The Federal Republic Republic announced on a program at Holger Munch in the first bloodged ARD on Saint Day in Sultanahmet Mey, and the 10 German citizens lost their lives.

In the Munch Europe, the coordination of coordination between the coordination and a closely communication.
Turkey officials said that the living bomb was a member of Sultanahmet attack and a member of the Syrian Empire, and the German Instructor Thomas de Maiziere had not yet identified the identification of the attack.

In addition to the love songs that touch our personal lives, Aksu, our country, and our world, he invited the songs of public songs.
After he made the concert he promised, Aksu said that he'd pay his life.
In the concentration of the "Sezen Years" concert, Sezen Aksu went with a different story to those who fill the Wolkswagen Arena.
Every story, show, light, and scene watchers have taken them to other times.
In the end of the unforgettable concert, a video display of the Devrim Erbil's Stanbul table.
And she was guesting them in his presentation by putting them on the videos they had written for the first time.
And there came 25 teams in Ankara and Istanbul.

"This was a decisive recipe for two years ago."
The Esnaf Rooms set this recipient two years ago.
It's a price used in Turkey.
I mean, it wasn't going to make a new cash, and it wasn't.
But he sold in some parts of Ankara 75 in some areas.
In some regions, he was already sold to 1 TL.
He who trusts his bread doesn't have to use 1 TL.
There's no proportion or fiction.
They're applying the unnecessary price.
"If we're not going to get enough of bread in the first half of the 2016, we'll be full of this price if we don't have a great crisis."
In some parts of Istanbul, he started selling bread to 1.25 TL.
And this time, Terrkina Faso found her blood.
In Burkina Faso, Western Africa, the U.S. capitals were killed by an estimated otettle of the United Nations administrators.
El Kaide has taken the northern African arm.
The attack in Burkina Faso has happened four days after the terrorist action that the majorest Muslim country of Endonezia was performed in Cacarta, the capital of the Muslim country of the world.
The foreign apostles lost their lives in Starbucks, where they were in a business room, and in a business street, and in the armed attack of the Polonya, a Canadian and an Indonesian life.
Indonesian officials explained that the attackers were inspired by Paris killing on November 13,.
The British BBC television officer Frank Garner noted that this action is part of a dreadful attitude in many cities in the last days.
He burned the life of the United States shortly before the Terror action.
At the beginning of the last month, 14 people lost their lives at an ISID patrol in the city of San Bernardino, California, U.S.A.
"San Bernardino" attack on the United States
After the German Instructor Thomas de Maiziere, after 10 German tourists were killed in Sultanahmet, we experienced two massive attacks, remembering that the German Arabs of the German Institute also had been attacked in many parts of the world.
If we say that, then the terror wins...
We used the word "untiny" without getting back.
ISID left Nespp to Alrawi.
According to a new report, the terrorist ISID uses his own chat tool to communicate independently from their conversation programs, such as NesAp, and Telegrams.
According to One's report, the organization uses a new messaging application to communicate between you.
This Android application is distributed and loaded by a APK file.
The program knows how the organization is able to communicate and share the media.
Fucking in Irak from III
According to the Ghost Security Group, the program remains "sApp and Telegram" on the "ilkel" programs, such as NesApp and Telegram.
The strongest implement of the use is not yet known.
WHEN ITD had previously performed through the telegram that allows you to send the message through the encrypted connection.
But the telegram was extracting the channels that the ITD members spoke.
In addition, the U.S. government requires that they put back doors on the application developers.
So the organization now starts using their solutions instead of trusting NesAp and Telegrams.

How should you measure the frequency?
We asked the students for the weekly breaking breakfast, and we asked for a schoolteacher Murat Alash.
It shouldn't be just for those who have a breakfast; it shouldn't be time for recreation, entertainment, television, and computers.
It's an important opportunity to prepare for the new education period and to analyze the past.
It's also an important opportunity to get a sense of humanity, knowledge, skill, and hobies.
Make a list of half-new investigation.
What you do, write everything you plan and try to do.
I'm sure you'll enjoy this, and you're going to spend a very productive period.
Now, especially, let's talk about a productive period for students who are ready.
Because the most important questions of your friends who are ready to test us are -- "How should we evaluate this period, how should we decide many questions, or do we have a lack of incomparable issues?"
To answer these and to make a productive period of time, let's go in with the advice of friends who are preparation for testing.
The test process has to be a process that starts from 9 to nine times, and we're trying to complete it in the past 1 years, and this has to be more effective, effective, and more effective for us.
The last class has to go along with the testing preparation, and the school recording work together.
The student who finished school has at least 1 times in test (YGS-LYS) and had experiences, and the year is important for her, even though she was prepared for the test again.
Because most of the students and family are viewed as the last chance of 'O', and that makes a bigger stress.
Reading: The student's performed only because he wasn't a pleasure, and so it's always the most important job, but it's a full task for students who are having a regular and altering habit, and it is always in the best time.
Now we've got a half break in the future, and we need to take care of it best.
To do that, there must be a plan that will help us manage our time well.
Six Year Relationship:
Everybody needs to make a precise plan for himself.
It's about 1st, what's going on, what's missing, the day, the week, and 15 days.
In this period, there must be repeated subjects, and the question must be solved.
At the same time, they can handle average 1-2 test test.
Relax your exact topics: investigate 75 percent of people's learned, 66 percent in a week, and one hour at an hour.
It's the best and most effective way to clear the mind.
Especially are students who make a lot of mistakes in the past should take a lot of responsibility on their general work.
Prepare your income first, and plan the day, and set your plans on each day, and you have certainly arranged for them.
This plan will comfort you as academic and psychological.
Beware that you have the most mistaken issues when you put them in your plans.
Because you're not going to have such a long vacation during the progress.
Build Questions:
It's very important to ask questions to do it again.
Because we can only see how much we understand about what we're doing.
Don't forget to set the number of issues every day.
You can change the number of questions that you're doing that day, but you can't solve a lot of questions on the day of your hard work, but at least we need to make a question to see how much we have learned about that day.
Test Test Tests:
Another work you're going to do in half annual festival has to handle tests.
Even though everything has not been finished, at least you can solve the lesson test.
Well, let's say, you've done the Turkish scrutiny, and you can solve a 40-month lesson that has been prepared for question.
And, of course, do that, and work for time.
If you can solve the 40 Turkish question first at 60 minutes, let the next time you can take care of a few minutes.
Tail and Hobi Plan:
Of course, the Talut is not just learning, and you've got to spend a few days for a breakup, rest, and your guests.
It'll only stop you from being an extraordinary time to study.
That's why you should have a special time in your plans.
Reading books, watching television, on the Internet, the most important is the time you spend on the Internet.
I'm gonna have a little advice to friends who said I wasn't able to make the first time fruitful.
If my first time hasn't been so good, I couldn't work too hard, and that's a great opportunity for you.
But primarily you have to decide and believe it.
In the Turkey football population 2009-2010 sezoon was enormous to 76 and 90 minutes.
Now, you've got to answer that question, and you're going to the kidroom room, or are you going to the kids, or are you still getting a big deal and you're going to have a lot of minutes on your hand?
I think nobody wants to say, "We'll look at the games ahead of us."
Now the only thing you're gonna do is to leave the past, look at your front, not to walk.
If we're going to comply with what we say,
(1) Primarily plan a half-time season,
( 2) Get back on the things you know.
(3) You've made your little cakes,
( 4) Do so by resolving the matter.
( 5) Solve tests,
Read it at www.jw.org
7) Set new goals for new times,
8) Take time to yourself, your customs, and the things you enjoy.
9) spend time with your family and friends,
(Getting time for social and cultural activities) (Cinema, sports, teater, konser, move, picnik vb)

The kilo loss of surgery can be helpful in medium degrees of diabetes.
According to a new investigation, the capital surgery may last five years at a lowest time in two diabetes of diabetes.
But early to tell the patients of the diabetes who are in the middle of the diabetes, who have not been able to interfere with the surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, the news reported on the new operas on JAMA's surgery and the observation operating in JAMA will take a long time.
Kilo lost surgery, the other name of the bariatric surgery, uses various methods to undermine the brain.
These will reduce hungry and restrict your body's dirty dirty ability.
In the years, the bariatric survey was curricular in 2 diabetes, but most of the researchs were made on the body's corresponding engine (VE) 35 or above.
I've been accepted normally from 185 to 249.
The BMI's a lot of kilometers on 25 or over, and 30 over the BMIs are counted as celebrities.
You can compute BMI from the link 1.gov/1DqDv.
In the new research, Taiwan's full-course Min-Sheng hospital has used two different bariatric cherubs, which have been used to curricular medication of medicine and typical surgery, since 2007.
Since the fifth year of the research, the center of surgery has returned to 24 to 245.
It's possible to stay in the BMI in the 29ks of those who have cure the survivors of surgery.
Diabet has been solved in the 36% of the surgery at 36%, and the sequence is solved at 28% of the surgery.
In the group who healed medical roads, the diagnostic has been solved only on 1,%2.
And the writers also reported that blood pressure control, trigliserids, and LDL colesterol is usually better in the ceremony group.
Scientists also showed the blood levels of A1c deoglobin’s blood levels that show the blood rate in time.
According to researchers, the A1c heoglobin's better holding under 7% of the A1c tuoglobin.
After the surgery, the A1c heoglobini is nearly 9 percent.
In the medicine group, he's staying in the middle of 8 percent.
But the A1c heoglobin hasn't decrease the death rate in five years, according to Chih-Cheng Hsu and his college friends.
The research team compares with these two surgerys.
Fifth year, the group who ignored the eppas operas (18,7 to 14,2 kg), also in BMI (7,4 to 5,1), and also in A1's aglobin (3,2%,1), the higher levels of higher levels (4,9, 16,7), and maybe all the diagnos.
At the end of the fifth year, Arizona said that the surgery was based on evidence that the surgery has been extended to the life of the surgery on the end of the fifth year, but from T. Collegi-Phoenix, Dr. Blackstone, which has been operating in Sweden.
In this work, the Sweden was less than 29 percent of the other people who had seen the bariatric surgery in 15 years, who had been curved by more traditional medicine.
Even though this new surgery doesn't show what benefits the survivors have to survive, it's for those who are under BMI 35.
And this is the most substance of the article, because the BMI has been called that operation is safe, the risk of death or repression.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should take care of BMI's on 27 to 30 when the patient falls down to the BMI's three to 30.
I think we've waited enough for people to take that serious step.
I think it's really difficult to turn it away from the genetic changes that made their bodies in the lines of poetic and diabetes.

Why am I a Witness in Oklahoma
I'm going to watch a man killed because of a legal intervention today.
I don't hope, but if it is, I'm gonna sit in the death room in the Oklahoma Dead Sealhane, Richard Glossip, in death enginement.
He wanted me to be one of four pictures of his death.
The invitation was first done by the best friend in January, and I accepted it, no matter how shocked I am.
As that day approaches, I was afraid of it.
So why am I doing that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
He's going to offer an unlikely perspective.
True, the newspapers are allowed to watch the executions in the United States, and there is a horrible piango, since they have more applications than they are available, who is chosen to choose.
The Oklahoma has dropped out of 12.
Anyone who chooses will follow his feelings.
I can't do that.

I love that guy.

Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the court, as he likes, get access.
I complained to him.
He admits that he can say better, but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip isn't the same idea in some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't accept it.
I told him you could get me out of the witnesses list when he wanted him.
But a international officer wants him to be there and write it down.
If she's dead, she thinks it's going to be a way to move against the death penalty.
Huffington will be with me, Kim Bellware.
If you want to get more information about this, please listen to the podcast series I have prepared.
I'm not going to tell you all the details here again.
I don't have any sure idea that Richard Glossip was innocent.
Barry Van Treese's death is enough to make him a crime partner.
But I still believe you're not guilty of murder.
I believe there's no enough evidence to rule a death sentence.
I think his death is wrong.
And I'll watch his death with this perspective.
I can't say I'm really going to be a hypocritical.
That's why you can look at the other reporters there.
I'm going to see what you're going to take from me, that you're going to take a look at the death of a man who likes to be killed in some unreasonable way.

Does that make me think you're starting to be personal?
RVL's got a number of balls, and maybe he wants to be responsible for what's done on the end of the runners?
Am I bad for the end?
Am I so bad for the endup?
Maybe the people outside think I'm like that.
Maybe they need my license and get me out, but I'm not sure what I'm thinking about them.
But when I come, I can't stop anything, and that's hurt me.
That really disappoints me.
I'm going to pressure them, and I'll carry them on the responsibility to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I'll go.
The long-time compulsory investigation in Lidari and the succumbing to the next compulsory situation has caused him to say, "Throw my license at the side of the table."

Brisbane Broncos contrensor Wayne Bennett of the Cumartesi night, after half of the Sunday, Storm sent to Storm for the "breaking" magnificence, and said that the two Oueensland is not "great" in the fight.
He defended the Bellamy team's fight, and he said that they were just focusing on the "temas".
Bellamy said that this means the fear of Storm's going to defeat them, so he's taken the critical critics from the two teams.
It's progressing -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson's talking about the war on Wednesday.
I believe we're not changing anything in our defense systems or techniques all the year, just in the last six weeks, and this has become a real point to us.
Trent has a big team that's in there for three years, and it's clear, and you've probably not used to lose a small choke for himself.
It's funny this year's in these times.
Bellamy opposed the idea of Bennett, remembering that Bennett's first nuclear futbols in 2010, George-Illawarra Dragon's first player.

I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 because he was a team, and he said Wayne would not even give a hit.
But now there's a team that we can play a stutball, especially with a youth futbol.
This is the football you want to play when you have this type of players.
In 2010, everybody wants to play this football -- no team, like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, isn't possible to play that way.
This gives me more confidence because they're not even afraid of playing.
When they went to big games six weeks ago, they couldn't mind us.
Bellamy also pointed out that Storm and Roosters were more higher scores than Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos's a good game, I haven't watched him yet, but what was the spor?
Our game is 20 - 18, the score of the two sides in our game, but is this more exciting futbol?
Or is it exciting to cut the ancestors, but not to make a score advertising ancestors?
That's my day, by me.
If they talk about us, it means we'll meet them in a moment later.

Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that Wilshere's shot at Dinamo Zagreb's shot before.
Wenger pointed out that Wilshere was in September and that he had no reason to play on Christmas.
The best sensor is that Wilshere's lost at least four bars in England, and it's not known as being part of the next European champion.
The most shameful part of the problem of the last problem is that Wilshere finished the seizure of a separate shot, and then searching the old cycle of the sex before it.
Wenger said that this type of sale isn't threatening.
It's a bone that hasn't been healed.
It's not a big thing.
It was just an accident.
This doesn't have any contact with chemicals or previous injuries.
According to a medical perspective, it may be true, but there is also a danger of making a predicament in the middle of the Seager.
There's also a disturbing picture that grows.
According to the research of Prömiyer Yaramaths Ltd, Wilshere's 23 different diseases have been recorded since six years ago.
The last five sezonda was only 65 of Arsenal's 157 lig game.
The big picture is one of the two first Lig teams who have lost in eight sections of 2007-08.
Wenger accepts the possibility, but he believes that it's going to be healed at Arsenal in the last sesore.
And Wenger said, "You're at a time when you come back from a cure, you're going to have a clear time to get sick. It is a process that you want to strengthen your body and win the battle."
Jack's so young enough to get out of this.
I hope the body will be statistics, I trust it, and I believe he's going to make a career.
The championships are preparing for the team of Wednesday at Dinamo Zagreb at Arsenal, who will start on Cumartesi and the next Sunday, Tottenham Hotspur games, and Wenger's team prepares for them.

It wasn't like this in Arsenal.
We were so close in 2006, but I'll have enough experience in the other way.

FriendsFest: We learn valuable lessons about friendships
It's interesting that there are no such ports in the programs, especially during the time when men need more to open, and they're in a 15-year-old manslayer.
In 2013, this was the biggest cause of the male's death between 20-45, and the women were more than three times.
To pay attention to this problem, Sefil Heaven (CALM) announced the campaign as a Human Year, and he plans to resist the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
There's a combination in the center of this hard task.
A study of more than 2,000 depressed colleagues of the colleagues, which showed that a person who was insected from this trouble had a highest "breaking mode" had twofold chances of healing.
Similarly, for those who are depressed, it blended the minds of an infant who can bring up a mental competition with healthy friends.
But, of course, you have to be able to win friends first.
Social media has a serious communication in this time; it makes it more important to answer, instead of a meaningful communication.
Our digital life has increased the need to look like strong, strong, good, and successful people, even though all things are in reality.
Problems of psychologists are under the control of money, imagination, social strategy, and the inner values that are influential to our mental health, and the inner self - inner self - interest and friendship.
Milerder's soon explained the creator's video games, he won't buy more happiness.
The beauty of the friends's sequence was that he turned his focus down.
The characters were not defined by their works, but they were identified by their characters, and they also showed it in their dealings with their friends.
Joey and Chandler's often kissed, watching the futbols in the conscientious chairs, and the fact that Ross' ran at Rachel's points to the fullest explanation of their feelings.
One of the helpers said to me, "... when I listened to people who are depressed and murdered, I saw the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference."
Most men who talk to us can't talk to their friends.
"That's a feeling like to go off." And it's also a weakness to open to others."
It's one of the programs I've been thinking about when I suggested to deal with a long predicament mechanism.
He focused on the small moments of a boyfriend.
My goal is to help people when a foreign statute in the telephone is difficult, but it comes from family and friends who are close to personal networks.
And if you join this weekend to the FriendsFest in the Comedy Central, why would you take your friends to the Central Perk for a drink?
Or, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You can't know how your friend will make a difference.

The Paris, who was with Real Madrid and Shakhar Donetsk, needed a powerful start, and they needed that to get out of the Swedish teams, not only to get the last three champion performances.
But the game they played was not the best game for the team of Laurent Blanc, and Zlatan Abrahamovich spent a lot of high positions in the area where he started his elevated position in 1999.

That's a good sign.
We wanted to win one or two gols, even though I didn't think we hadn't hit one or two more.
Abrahamovich was back to Paris, after the last two-2-day games in Lig at Bordeaux. But in the fourth minutes, he's left in the shadow of Di Maria.
When the Argentinanian canater was transferred from the United States, PSG was viewed as a PSG player in Europe, and he went back in Marco Veratti, running back to Malmöe, and Johan Wiland, who sent Johan Wiland from a remote corner.
But when everybody expects PSG to win a great victory, he was disappointed.
He was trapped on the way out of the floor, a nine international player, five men, and two player in the middle area, and he was a heavy psychologist.

On the other side, PSG gave them an opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary pass and independent stages, first half of which Abrahamovi couldn't end in the fifth stage, and the second half begins to make it impossible to compromise Cavani's game.
But when he came to organize his coworkers, he showed that he was more skillful, and in 52 minutes, he was Abrahamoviç, who sent the phonograph to Maria's capital to Wiland.
The second gol came through Cavani, and the Uruguay player, after Abrahamoviç's cooking, recording the six goats of Maxwell's head.
After the ideas that Malmö would return to the game, and after the game, Ezequiel Lavezzi was not known to be considered hystery, Willand saved David Luiz's empty position, and he didn't let the porch change.
Later, the Malmö contester Age Hareide PSG was superior to his team, Norveçly said, "Our last champions team was in December last year."
Since that history, we've played the ball in Sweden Ligi, not just in the same level.
The teams on the side are not enough.
He's kidding Paris.
It's a great game for them.

The mineture is now too much moda-Zaman Gazaday, Saturday.
The roads in the Moda world turn around and come to the bags.
It's the possibility in the past, and the mines are...
It's possible that the small bags that have been hit by the biggest ones are focusing attention.
They say that everything's small.
I think this view is true for the bags.
Nearly unhappy in the cats and streets, the wind began to jump from the opposite direction, and the bags were hurled down.
The small bags had already been, but this time they came up against us with the throats of the big bags.
It's only your phone, your credit card, and your key.
The creline and Hermés started to spread with Prada.
The curiosity of the purchasing bags also impressed new models.

The "Birkin" board, Hermes's corresponding to Jane Birkin.

The weeks of the Moda weeks have helped the mine floor.
And in the podiums, the mini bags are running.
It's not possible that you can't put them in your arms because they're too small.
They can use the long quantities.
But in the podiums, we've seen that long quests, and it's more likely to be filled with models.
Fendi, the mine's carrying his pocket to a predicament.
There's a suggestion to those who don't have a little bag, but they can't give up.
The big bags are a friend of mini.
How?
The milk bags turn into a snake that can be ripped into their biggest chests.
This presentation in the podium is taking a fast payment on the street.
Let's see what else we'll see!
In my book, the transfiguration change.
To Turkey, it's at the level of competition with the world marks.

We don't know he came to Istanbul.
But as Steve Lazaridas said, Bansky doesn't even know about this serial.
There's no situation that requires him to be granted.
Because the way of Bansky and Lazaridas, who were old friends, left 12 years later.
Some of the observances were collected from Lazaridas and some of the collections.
But Bansky's followers are interested.
What would Banksy think about the "The Art of Bansy" series of 85 works together?
What would he say if he saw a small cafeteria cafeteria at the end of the 800 meters?
The Red Balonly girl, would he scream out that the works of the cleannesser, the Gul, the world’s wounds, and the wounds of the world's wounds are ripped on the bathrooms, and the arms were made?
It's a disappointment for those who hide his identity, a artist who has an anarchist's spirit.
It's not the way of Banksy.
But you still take the limited number of licenses without ending it!
For Banksy, the large serial for the world of the world in the "The Art of Bansy" is to be seen in the month of Nisan.

It is they who are the wrongdoers.
That is because they are with those who believe.
Here's what these kids in the Cyrus, the three-year-old Mevlude, who's accompanied with her father.

I'm so clear and clear.

But Gmurhan, who has a building company in Hollanda, explains why and how he had his chemicals in 2014.
A documentary of the Berlin Film Festivali's "Generation Kplus" about the world championry of a six-year-day school student.
The young Pehlivans who were selected to make the first documentary of this section are one of the Cristal Awards.
It's Mete Grimhan, even though I'm born in Hollanda.
He listened from his grandfather's wounds and watched the recorders.
"In Turkey, there's only political problems."
I wanted to tell the world about what happened in Anadola.
"Woe to the fight of our colleagues." He wants to meet 6 director and prepare a documental project.
This project will fail, but it's going to open the door to Gmurhan that you read on a plane.
"We've been in the cheeker factory."
A 10-11-year-year-old fighter is going to Mete Gmirhan, who's a family.
The kids' father doesn't allow the children's register for documentation.
Gymrhan says how she dealt with this problem, "I thought I could do all day long.
'Cause the support of the Cultural Minister.'
Dad was talking about a living school in Amasistan when the kids were going to meet.
I'm on my mind to go there.
When I called two kids, I met 26 kids who were at school with a fight.
We've started a week's preparation, and we finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We've sat in the facility's bed."
The biggest challenge that the documentation that was completed in three weeks was the way it was.
"I didn't know what to meet when I took it."
He says, "They didn't know the Turkish."
The young Pehlivans are focusing on the story of six of the 26 kids of fighters.
Baran, who was raised by his grandfather, and who was not able to participate in his arms because he broke his hand, and he was a curious but health problems, Beytullah, the boy of the school, the smallest champion Ahmet and the group...
Mete Gmurhan says his work with kids, "I left them completely."
I'm just trying to use Paul everywhere.
I've made a piece of grades in the first half weeks.
I wanted the kids acted like they had no cameras.
"Oh, they used to be quick."
It's surprised to pick to Berlin
Mete Gymrhan says that the young Pehlivans did not expect Berlin Film Festivali, "We had a harassment, but we've been elected to Berlin."
The young Pehlivans aren't a sports document, but I'm an architecture that tells the children's struggles and cuts off their lives.
He says, "I wanted to get the identification and problems of the children who have problems.
Supporting the Academys of Art world
After the news of the Academys for Peace, the Academys of Insidiati comes back to the backing of the Copennation to interrogation and to get the administrators on the last day.
The first support came from the geniuss who had many famous names among them.
The diagnosis on the last day, and last day the theaterians's support.
The significance of 138 theater's signing, "... we are here with the Academisians who are called to peace in the autumn in the field of theatra and the scene-gstery artists, and we tell that we are near the honored meeting of the Academians, who are called for peace in the fields of peace, and that we are in a position of equality, equivalentity, equivalentity, equivalentity, the right of life, and peace of unfaithful peace."
And it was said, "We add our voice to the call of all our vice and all our heart and all the celebrants."
And there are over 400 conservators among them who are inconsistently, Atilla Mandemir, Nadir Star Alper, Special Alper, Serra Alper, Honor Island, Pelin Estamer, Tolga Karachelic, "We're with you and the art.
But without it, if you don't say, "We will not share this crime."
The Academys for peace were supported by the Academys of Insidiati."
And she said, "We are with the advertisers who are the target of the launch camp."
The Academys published a report of peace with similar explanations they made in Ankara and Istanbul on 11 January and the Stanbul, and they called the government to peace and agree, saying, "We are not part of this crime."
Metne was signed by 1128 academic at colleges and books, including Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etiene Balibar.
Republic President Erdogan and Prime Minister David criticized academic report by academic "found support to theterrent."
After this call, some universities started accompanying akademisers.
Tonight, a lot of akademisics were taken.
My career, please help!
Hürrem Sultan's red hair, Beren's burn, Justin hair...
Trying to be the normal one place, but it seems to be a psychological disorder after the whole point of life.
The "Celebrity worship syndrome", the name of the other's famous worship sendromu, a very much academic in the world, and a new conversation in us.
The cafeteria's ladies can be normal enough to run the ladies' photographs of the cafeteria.
But you should not forget the 'Hirrem Sultan' year that all the youngsters were walking with the girls of Ireland.
In 2015 the estetic operations of "Breen burnu" has already been reported.
That's not a different thing in the kids.
Wearing like Potter Aleledar once was an administrator.
Now, it's in the middle of a sharp wind.
Justin Bieber's copy is filled with geniuss.
So that we've been read in the Internet thousands of times, "When you first go to the browsing, put your hair on your sides, your ears, and its surroundings upstairs."
It's gonna be short.
You need to shape your hair after the cutting process is finished.
Stand your hair with the sprey help after the scheming process is finished.
"To get the hair of the jump."
All of this has been academic celebrity's accompanying us in the world's new speech syndrome.
The fantasys look like a love suit.
The artists boast about how much they're impressed by their exciting numbers.
Well, he doesn't see psychology so simple.
In fact, it's a dispute that the youngsters decide what to eat, what to listen, and what to wear.
Unreasonable names are considered to be unreasonable, getting role models of spirit disorder.
Professor of psychology Sumye Demir admits that Turkey has left behind the work in this area.
But he does not realize that familys are progressively discerned, and he says, "It's one of the main issues of psychological science is peaceable with him, and one of their own identities."
First, it wasn't very important to fill the kids' room with ceremonies.
It's changing now.
He feels the need to interfere with his parents.
"That's a sign of devotion to one of the other, that you're a young man's life's disturbing."
Frequency speed peaks on the train
It's safe to take care of the curious ones, not to be overly excessive.
Don't ask her to get married, envying her wife, and prefering her clothes, Demir recommends to pay attention to the marks.
We're talking about the dignified people on his name.
It's as normal as if it's a matter of interest in them.
But when your expert psycholoc's cancer, youths who have lost the knees of the psychology, mostly say, "I'm not going to have the names of a kid or a kid in the family, which will be represented by a good act."
There's always no good examples.
"He's driving his injury, kid."
When we talk to them about how we should approach them, Sumie Demir reminds us that the dignified symptoms have been seen in many years.
It's more easy if the adults are thought that they're not safe.
On the other hand, when we complain about the restriction of their families, we meet young people who are waiting for the help and compassion: "We have to consider their emotional abuses."
The new research shows that they have been forced because of the changes developed in their brains.
"And it should be naturally complicated, so it should be closed to someone who's shooting on a dynamic speed train."
It is possible to change their behavior
Professor of psychology Smithe Demir reminds the parents of their assignments to overcome the honorable worship sendroom:
Know her emotional pain, make sure you're calm before you get into the matter.
Never let him stop his feelings.
Show her respect for her fancy to encourage independence.
Instead of resenting to teach, discuss names that will be role models for him.
Try to determine where the ideas are in our daily lives.
Reading the books of the true world of the proud will be helpful.
Convert your communication to the adult format.
Remember the same paths in the brain of dependence and motivation.
Tell your child that the errors have an opportunity to change, and accept it as well.
You're definitely the expert support of money.
It's amazing to be angry, and it's amazed.
It needs to be reliable and help on the basis of celebration.
It's a love that can't be trapped, a call to help.
Unfortunately, he doesn't.
Moreover, this problem is so common that it can't limit a country or a captain.
Dr. Recai, John's son, noticed that there are specific names of television every country.
The sendrom shows himself to be connected to these famous ones, "They're unusual."
Most of them do not have their potential.
And those possess are not like them.
It's because they weren't, or they weren't.
But those who do not have the means to be able, and they will not be able to live like them.
There's no difference to those who watch in the gate, or curtain.
Each of them eats Hayranity with the whole heart.
They're going to earn unreasonable money, they're in the day of the cash.
It's even enough to increase fantasy.
Another suggestion of the expert Psikology Demir is, in that point, to question the reality of those lives.
Suni should not be missed about life.
It's the support of the person who's being arrested, it's going on here.
But the person's shifting to admit that the fancy is the same as his own pain.
By the VIKO, Panasonic's child Theatro, in the week of Emergic Committee, he's going to play for the students.

Dr. Fevzi Özghur, she answers questions in the corner of the Meydan Gazate.
I've got a stone in my stairs, and every morning when I get up, I'm going to go to Tuvale two or more times after eating.
Can that prevent me from giving me a kilo?
I started using the alcale right now, but I don't want to eat, I can't kilo.
That's what I've been since I was a child.
What should I do?
Do you think I have to be operative?
CEVAP: The safra is often involved in an infection.
This grieving disease is an indication that you've been hit by eating food, and you've smoldered the stairs of the rubbers.
The screams who are injured because of an injury, they're trying to get out of this stairs quickly.
That's why you're going to the tuvale.
And because you've been in a low tuvalet, you're thrown off without your food, and your kilops are slow.
I think you have to heal this situation.
If you go to a Gastro intelologist and find out what I say, you can get rid of this situation.
But at the end of the end, you may have a surgery.
Alkalen probiyotics can reduce your complaint, but he won't.
Whatever happens, I'm saying I'm going to continue using the probation.
'Cause this is the biggest helper for you to be weak.
I'm eating a lot of dinner when I'm under stress.
When I'm stressful and angry, I'm giving myself to eat, and I'm kissing.
How can I start this?
CEVAP: The desire to eat a lot of food means that it doesn't take enough energy.
That might be the reason to eat less, or to throw off the lunch and lunch.
Another reason is that you can't be able to cheat the monsters you eat.
That's what your dirty system needs to work well.
If you're a license, revisible, or like that, the best way to use a good probiotic medicine.
You'll see your advantage more.
I can't kilo, doctors don't know why.
In your village, you've got information about the weakening of it.
It's very reasonable to me, but it's a little different to me.
I can't kiss any kind of kiss.
Most important, I don't know why.
The doctors don't say anything.
CEVAP: The technology we use is not only to be weakened but also to resume the physical physician function.
It's the same kind of weakness.
It's the same technique that you don't get a kilo in the throat without having a kilo infant.
You're weaker when you eat food.
I'm sorry, you've got this right now.
You can also get kids by warnings and healthy food.
I mean, you've lost your idea body and gone away.
And our other patients have turned away from their ideal body.
You're going to get a kilometer to your ideal body, and they'll reach you with a kilometer.
If the system problem is gone, you'll get a kilo and they'll get kilo.
But first the system needs to work properly.

The kid who feels worthless, he's crazy.
There are some feelings in the world of human emotions that have born.
Fear, sorrow, happiness, disappointment, anger, fear...
But the hatred, the hatred, the hatred, the retaliation, and the result of some wrong attitudes.
In addition, every human being needs to be born as a human.
I mean, your parents, or social environment, should respect their decisions, you want to be asked about what concerns him and feel precious.
It's the foundation of a healthy human being.
For example, the behavior of a child does not mean to show respect for the characteristics of the child, not to take care of the needs of the child, but to the child’s rights, not to pay attention to their own interests, but to accompany him.
The child's unreasonable child loses his own freedom of self, and his defense will reveal his anger and hatred to protect him.
The psychologist Hill Arslan says that the child doesn't accept what is done by hateing him, and he's trying to tell her and her about her and her neighbor.
The expert psychologist that the child doesn't accept the situation and responds to the situation, says, "I'm the hatred here here, and the child serves the purpose of maintaining his respect for him."
He says, "If you're allowed to be a kid's individual, hatred will end up."
The kid's trying to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred
Arslan says that in his youth, the most dangerous and spiritually desperate times the children’s parents are insignificant and emotional violence can lead to the child’s negative feelings and disappointment.
Arlan adds: “Sometimes, it may be that it should not be provided only for emotional needs. It may be that it should not be just kissing, kissing, kissing, schooling, or other necessities, and sometimes the physical needs of [means, drinking, drinking, and school needs, etc.] may not be accepted.
It's the attitude of a love of hatred.
In emotional and hypocritical violence, abusive, abhorrent, abusive, reprimand, unreasonable, unreasonable, and silent.
Such behavior is an impact on a child’s personality, and it touchs a deep place.
"The kid or the kid will lose his respect for himself by accepting these things, and he's shrinking his life in a worthless, unbreakable, unbreakable, and he's trying to defend himself with anger and hatred."
