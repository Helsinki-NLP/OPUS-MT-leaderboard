He's not a good dinner.
Tom said he wasn't in any emergency.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you weren't Candy.
Come to watch us music for some time.
Tom told me why Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do this today.
Tom told me that he would be complaining about it.
Tom's a member of my home-op.
Tom went down the street where Mary lives, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know, and I've got no chance to Tom will do that.
Tom didn't know whether she should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know Tom's supposed to do that.
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to do.
It'd be tired to do that.
Tom had to tell us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should do that.
We're gonna have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary was really planning to do this this week.
Tom knew he would be punished.
I don't think I never saw anyone doing that before.
That's not hard.
I'm afraid we haven't left.
Tom told me how to play the drums.
We haven't succeeded yet.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he didn't eat anything, but it wasn't true.
I'm an atheist.
Tom said Mary was at home with a cold.
I wonder if Tom really thought it was a good idea to do it.
Tom said she knew she had to do this on her own.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was puzzled.
Tom said he'd be glad to do that for you.
Tom said I looked a little pale.
Tom told Mary that she should quit being confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom is hiding something from me.
Did you know Tom didn't start playing the guitar until he was 30 years old?
I wonder if Tom knows if Mary wants to do that.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20.
I know Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why are everybody looking at us?
I know Tom didn't know who did that to Mary.
I think Tom did that because everyone in his family did it.
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe.
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you would like to do that.
Tom didn't talk to Mary yet.
I don't think Tom's beautiful.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
I wouldn't have allowed you to go home alone the last night.
I think I'll have a chance to do that tomorrow.
Tom said you were really good at tennis.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was an atheist.
Tom would have wanted to go to Boston.
I know Tom is much more creative than Mary.
I know Tom is more creative than me.
Tom said he doesn't want to know why we did that.
I think you'd all agree that Tom is one of our best agents.
Tom said he was depressed.
Tom said I shouldn't have to do this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom never left early.
She's already married.
That's a blasphemy!
Tom said she wasn't awake.
Tom said he was happy to do that.
You can't buy one of those less than 30 dollars.
Do you think Tom would like to go to Australia with us?
Tom said he likes dance with Mary.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that.
Tom must have seen us doing that.
I'm sure Tom will run for the president.
Tom had to do this last night.
Tom may be angry.
Tom said Mary wouldn't be mad.
I knew Tom wanted us to do that for him.
Tom said he wasn't living in Australia anymore.
I know Tom knew he didn't need to do that.
I hope I don't forget anyone.
Tom said she knew she shouldn't do that.
I didn't think Tom would be so angry.
I thought you liked romance novels.
I suspect Tom and Mary are stubborn.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anyone who hates Tom.
Tom said he thought I could win.
Three years ago, I was in Boston.
I don't think I can do what Tom does.
Why don't anyone listen to me?
Riches don't care about me.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
Tom said he had no idea to leave early.
It's not for the starters.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were depressed.
I think Tom doesn't know how to swim.
Tom has a lot of friends here.
Tom knows he was deceived.
I think Tom was used to be a member of our club.
Where's your notebook?
I don't think I'm going to be early tomorrow.
It's probably not that Tom will always admit that he's wrong.
How many kilometers are from here to the trilroad station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopts the behavior and speech models that characterize the use of it.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking about having dinner at six.
Tom told Mary that she would do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's over.
Tom said Mary's dog's down.
Tom said he was doing that.
Tom said he's curious about his suspicion.
She's so close to her.
I thought you would show me how to do that.
I'm telling you that we have to think Tom is dead.
Mary has a hairdresser appointment.
Tom told Mary that she might be allowed to do this today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It's smelling like someone's smelling a smell here.
We're just on the last train.
I think that question is not appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a child?
I don't think nobody noticed what we're doing.
What are we going to do?
I could cry.
There's no free dinner.
I thought you said we wouldn't go to Boston with Tom.
Tom's quitting smoking.
I think I know what Tom's doing here.
Tom and Mary said they'd be happy to help.
I'm sure that will not happen now.
They're not as fussy as they were.
We're going to school every day except Sundays.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't hungry.
Tom thought she wouldn't survive.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was a scientist.
Tom said he was forgotten to lock the door.
Tom told Mary that she should wash her car.
They said they didn't want to argue.
Tom admits that he did what he was accused of doing.
Are you both Candy?
Why would anyone want to kiss Tom?
I knew Tom never did that.
They said they had no more details.
Tom thought Mary loved me, but I knew he hated me.
Tom thinks I need to go.
Tom told everyone he didn't understand French.
They said they didn't like it.
Not everyone knocked Tom.
Everybody needed to do that.
I thought Tom looked a little pale.
I turned the lights away.
He's a shopping addict.
Tom said Mary was going home to Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't sleeping.
Tom thought Mary was listening, but she wasn't.
I thought you said Tom was a barber.
I wonder if this really works.
Let's get the point.
Did you give Tom the key?
Tom wasn't surprised when Mary told him that she had to do that.
My father is a doctor.
I don't think I'd like to marry Tom.
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Tom does that often by himself.
I've learned a lot from this conversation.
I thought Tom would buy that car.
Tom and Mary said they're busy right now.
Tom said he was planning to stay home all day.
Tom should have apologized to Mary.
Tom said she believed Mary.
I'm afraid I can't finish this report in time.
Tom was about 30 years old when he moved to Boston.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary's supposed to do that.
Everybody's here except Tom and Mary did it.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was satisfied.
Tom said he would help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut the turkey for the guests.
I know Tom doesn't know he doesn't really have to do that.
I think Tom's gonna understand that.
I didn't decide yet.
I know that isn't worth it.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was insolent.
It's not wrong.
Tom and Mary told me that they were offended.
I'm so grateful to you.
Tom's bad.
I knew Tom wasn't a good student as Mary.
Mary told me she was home.
Tom said she thought she might want John to do that.
I know Tom is forgetful.
Tom said Mary was mad.
Tom says he's not guilty.
Nobody laughed at Tom's joke.
Tom said it wasn't his biggest problem.
We're planning to go tomorrow.
I think Tom's scores, more than Mary.
What are you trying to do?
We didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
You'd better take your shoes off.
I didn't think we did anything wrong.
Everybody knew Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom's already decided he's going to sign the agreement.
Is that true that you were there?
What do you think Tom would have done?
They say they're not coming.
Tom said he was really happy to do that.
I think Tom's probably here tonight.
Tom said he could do that.
Tom told Mary that she would never do that again.
I hope Tom's crying right now.
You're really an angel!
Tom's already decided he's not trying to escape.
Tom told Mary that she had to do that.
Tom's already decided he wouldn't do that.
Tom's a horrible joke, because he doesn't forget the punchline.
Tom and I are both hungry.
Tom and Mary say they won't do that for you.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was trustable.
Tom says Mary is still scared.
Tom and Mary said they did it on Monday.
Tom doesn't know I never did that.
Tom told me I should go to Boston with Mary.
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father.
I know Tom's missing.
I would like to do that.
It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that by himself.
I was so excited!
Tom is a participation animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom will not have to do that today.
I hope I don't need to do that.
Tom must have changed a lot.
Nobody's better than me.
Just soon I saw Tom, I could tell him he was angry.
I know Tom shouldn't do that here.
He's here.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is now.
My wife is also a scientist.
I turned the computer off.
Tom and Mary told me they were not ready.
Tom says Mary is still mad.
I'm sure Tom has relatives in Australia.
Tom could have waited so easy for us.
Tom told me he didn't need a wheelchair anymore.
I thought you said you didn't do that.
Tom said he would help me.
I know Tom isn't sleeping yet.
Tom said he thought Mary was a mistake.
They're not here, they went home.
Tom said she wasn't interested in sports.
Tom wasn't impressed.
Tom didn't realize Mary didn't like him.
Tom and Mary said they can fly everybody they know.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that.
Tom was the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
Where are you planning to do that?
I didn't know you were doing that by 2:30.
Tom said he'd be hot next month.
I wish I was on your side!
Get your paws out of me.
I'm afraid I have to reject it.
I know you're just retired.
I knew Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder if we really do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should've just walked down.
I don't think you're listening to me.
We're brothers and sisters.
I don't think Tom's done this.
I don't think we've done anything wrong.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone before.
Didn't you have any television?
Don't give up!
I'm not playing the mandolin and you.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't have to do that anymore.
I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
It's the feeling.
Tom has known Mary since she was a child.
Tom said he's gonna do that on Monday.
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
I think Tom's going to Boston next week.
It's not far from the hotel.
I have to find it.
Tom said he didn't have a lot of friends in Australia.
Tom said Mary wasn't safe.
Tom could have used the help.
Tom said he thought Mary would be scared by that.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary was asking for a divorce.
Tom says he's lonely.
I knew Tom was a better student than Mary.
I'm Jack.
Tom and Mary said they'd be tempted to do that.
Tom said it wasn't the main reason why Mary had to do that.
Tom said he's planning to stay in Australia.
After rain, just air.
I knew Tom might want to learn how to do that.
Tom and Mary say they need to do the same.
I'm not married yet.
Tom hasn't been told that he doesn't have to do that yet.
I'm sure Tom's gonna do that next week.
I promised Tom I'd be there by 2:30.
Winning is always hard.
I'm driving a car.
I'm sure that's not the case.
Tom didn't know she was planning to stay in Boston for a few weeks.
I love Tom back in Australia.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom probably said he would do that tomorrow.
They said they weren't happy.
Tom said Mary isn't tough.
I haven't finished my supper yet.
Tom didn't know you were there.
I don't know if Tom and Mary planned to do that.
I don't think Tom's still sleeping.
Tom said she didn't think she really knew how to do that well.
I'm sure Tom feels the same way you do.
Tom said he feels sick.
Tom told me that John wouldn't have to do that.
I hope no one follows you.
Tom knows he should have been able to do that better.
I know Tom's gonna be motivated to do that.
You think we had to talk to Tom about this?
Tom said he didn't give Mary any money.
Tom may not be able to do that.
I know you don't enjoy yourself here.
Kindergarten children are better than some adults.
I thought we could go together.
I thought I should say something to Tom, but I didn't know what to say.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary's planning to do that.
Tom wanted everyone to know that he was unhappy.
I know Tom wanted me to do that.
You look busy.
Tom and Mary both looked at John.
They think they're stronger than me.
I read this in the newspaper.
How am I improved?
Tom doesn't like that.
They told me that they would be wise.
I should have written it down.
I'm not hungry anymore.
You can do it.
Tom likes to keep things up to him.
I don't think everyone gave up.
I thought you believed Tom to help us.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to Tom's funeral.
I'm so happy.
I know Tom's gonna do that today.
I know some of your students don't like you.
Kyoko had a favor to carry my bag for me.
Tom told me she thought Mary was hurt.
Tom said she knew she shouldn't have to do that.
It doesn't seem to be raining tomorrow.
I didn't know you were planning that next winter.
I don't know what that means.
I think it's more important to discuss possible solutions.
I didn't understand both Tom and Mary should do that.
Dom and Mary are both smelled?
It's the time Tom promised him to be here.
We're not going to vacation.
I don't think I can do what I want.
I think Tom's handing it well.
Tom and I know Mary wants to do that tomorrow.
I don't think I can explain the difference.
Tom said he thought it would be better if we didn't do that.
I thought everybody was a Vegetarian here.
Tom said Mary didn't look happy with her.
Nobody's perfect.
I think Tom and Mary don't have children yet.
I'm faster than you.
Tom has an insurance sense of humour.
I wish I had someone else.
I didn't know you were scared.
When Tom told me that she and Mary were divorced.
I think Tom's not cooperative.
Tom and Mary took their shoes off.
I wasn't really planning to do that.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's supposed to do that.
Tom said he doesn't care about buying that for you.
Tom won't admit he was wrong.
Sorry, but I can't do that.
Tom and Mary said that it wasn't hard to do as they expected.
Tom told me she was psychized.
We should have brought lunch.
The pop drinking brand in most countries is Coca-Cola.
Tom didn't have to stay home to help us.
I think Tom had already told us everything we need to know.
I need to buy some new clothes.
I think it would be fun to Boston.
Has anyone told Tom to do that tomorrow?
I think Tom should do that himself.
Tom said he didn't give Mary her phone number.
I knew Tom wouldn't want to go to Australia with Mary.
You have to tell Tom you're not planning to move.
Tom said we needed at least 300 $300 to buy what we needed.
I know Tom's gonna do it.
I thought you were right.
I think Tom will be disheartened.
Tom said Mary was working in Australia.
My father isn't a talker.
I know Tom wouldn't be forgiven for doing that.
I'm sure Tom's coming here at the time.
Tom thought Mary was just going to be happy.
Do you promise you wouldn't tell you Tom I gave you his phone number?
I didn't know you did that by yourself.
I think Tom could solve that problem by himself.
Tom said he would do that.
Tom told me she was heading home.
Tom thinks Mary will not be home on October 20.
I thought everyone was hungry.
Tom said he would do it.
I know Tom is a strange man.
We may have to go to Australia the next month.
I always knew Tom was desperate for greatness.
Did Tom tell you how he plans to do that?
Tom thinks Mary will not be the last one to do that.
How dare you laughing at me!
Tom and Mary say they'd like to win.
I promise I won't tell anyone where it is.
Sport is good for your health.
Tom said Mary was moved to do that.
I don't think it's probably here today.
I thought you said you wanted Tom to do that.
I wonder if Tom would really do that today.
I thought Tom couldn't do that.
Tom said he thought he could win.
Tom said she's glad Mary could do that.
Tom said he thought she could fix Mary's car.
Tom said he was out of drinking.
Tom told me she thought she was Mary.
Are you good Tom gonna do that?
Tom said he didn't have a lot of time.
Tom and Mary wondered why everyone was looking at them.
Both Tom and Mary know that it's not gonna happen.
Tom will stop Mary from doing that.
Tom said she probably thought Mary wasn't having fun.
I should have talked to Tom first.
I don't think Tom knows how to play the cello.
I think Tom could leave Boston tomorrow morning.
Tom says he's not trying to do that.
Don't tell anyone where Tom is.
Tom said he thought it would be better if we didn't do that here.
They promised that they would do it.
I didn't know you could do that well.
I don't think Tom will be happy that happens.
I think Tom could do that alone.
He's capable of anything.
I thought you said we're not going to sing.
There's a dog!
I thought you could swim.
I thought you were moved to do that.
Tom said he didn't need a break.
Tom said she shooted Mary in self-fense.
I wish you had told me this before.
Tom was surprised that Mary couldn't dance very well.
They told everyone they were tired.
Tom was surprised when Mary told him that she was only thirty years old.
I thought you would like to do it alone.
Tom thinks I need to sleep more.
I thought you said you didn't see Tom this morning.
Tom said he wasn't hurt.
Tom said she wasn't happy.
Tom's phone to say he's not coming.
He's just a purpose.
We're giving Tom a birthday party.
They said they thought they could do it.
I wonder if I can do that again.
I feel depressed often.
Tom says she can't prove Mary's doing that.
Tom said he thought he had to do that.
I wonder if Tom already did that.
You should have eaten some cake.
Tom said he doesn't think you need to do that.
Tom and Mary think they have flus.
Who told you that we should do that?
Tom said she did that once.
I knew Tom wasn't a very good man.
Tom knew he had to do it by himself.
What's cooking in the mutchen?
I thank you for your help.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was interested in doing that.
Tom told me she thought Mary was strange.
They're hiding.
Tom realized he wasn't enough to reach the top cabin.
I don't think Tom will do this with you.
I'm tired of homework.
I don't think I'll dance with Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I didn't start studying French until I was 30 years old.
I think Tom is unbelievable.
It should have been easy to do it.
Tom knew Mary told everyone she wasn't going to Boston.
You don't need to be here any more.
Nobody looks like Tom.
Tom and Mary say they can't believe anyone.
Whatever Tom says, I'm planning to do it.
I'm proud of you.
It was clear that Tom wanted to do that yesterday.
I think Tom wouldn't be in Australia now.
I should have done that with Tom.
I didn't think anyone would help you.
Tom and Mary said they weren't home.
Earth is a planet.
I think Tom would be skeptical.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was independent.
Tom told me that she thought Mary would be suspicious.
I feel that I could do better.
I thought Tom was kind of sweet.
Tom said he didn't expect any help from you.
I thought you said I should do that.
When's Tom planning to eat?
Now we know that's not true.
I don't think Tom sees that way.
Unfortunately, Apple doesn't provide a warrant for predicted damages.
I think Tom likes doing that.
He's the lazy man I know.
Tom or Mary haven't done that yet.
Don't talk nonsense!
Tom said Mary wasn't afraid.
I should have helped you to do that.
Tom said he would give Mary a book.
I think Tom can sing a country music better than anyone else I know.
Both Tom and Mary saw you.
Tom thinks Mary will be able to convince John to do that.
I don't know if Tom works or not.
There's no question about it.
Nobody can solve that problem.
I'm not going to talk to him anymore.
I think Tom's gonna do that too.
I shouldn't have allowed you to do that.
I've already met everyone.
Tom said Mary would do that too.
Tom said he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they wouldn't wait.
I don't believe I should do that.
I think you should accept Tom's retirement.
I didn't know you're going to let Tom do that by himself.
I know Tom might want to do that.
Tom said she didn't look like she was enjoying herself.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to sleep when she came home.
Maybe Tom doesn't know I've never done that anymore.
It's a dead poison!
They know they're watching.
Tom told me he thought Mary could speak French.
Tom might be sleeping.
I know Tom's not a very good manager.
I don't care if you do it.
It's not roctic science.
Tom said he wanted to help us.
There's someone waiting for you.
They said they were ready.
Tom and Mary said they felt light.
You know you shouldn't do that, don't you?
Nothing's done.
Let's make sure that doesn't happen.
I know Tom knows why we can't do that for him.
Tom said he thought it could be in Boston, too.
I didn't know Tom was an agency.
I think Tom would like to be the next one to do that.
Tom said I was the one with the problem.
You don't expect to do that, are you?
If it's good tomorrow, we'll jump the mountain.
Nobody told Tom what to do.
Have you ever hit someone?
I don't think Tom was mad.
I knew Tom knew how to do that.
Tom and Mary told me that they were healthy.
I think that's wrong.
There's a place for everything.
Tom said he wouldn't be allowed to do that anymore.
I told Tom you were hungry.
Tom's absolutely sure he saw a wolf.
I don't think it's your decision.
I thought you were retired.
Tom said she would hope Mary wouldn't do it by himself.
They said they had to work.
My father will not be busy tomorrow.
They told everyone that they were cold.
Didn't you know Tom's not trying to do that?
I was surprised when I heard Tom had been murdered.
I know Tom's a few years older than I am.
Tom told me she was strong.
Tom and Mary say they can't wait for that long.
Tom thinks she should help Mary.
I wonder if Tom really told Mary that she shouldn't do that.
Tom won't let anyone except Mary drive his car.
I don't think Tom knows why I wanted to do that.
Nobody was there.
Tom told Mary that she was going to stay for a few days.
I know Tom wasn't the first one to do that.
Tom said he didn't have to do that.
I didn't think you would do it by yourself.
I don't think we have enough food to feed everyone.
I know Tom's not a bad person.
It's said he knows the secret.
I think Tom would be a good roommate.
Tom said she thought she was supposed to do that.
I know Tom didn't know who did that for him.
Tom said he was fine.
Why didn't you tell me you didn't want my help?
Tom said he didn't think he could do this today.
I just want you to consider the possibility that you're wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said she thought she was supposed to do that next time she went.
I'm happy as much as I can.
If they knew what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans.
I know Tom didn't know he didn't want to do that.
Tom is rich, but he's not like Mary.
Go wake up and tell him that the breakfast is ready.
Tom was surprised that Mary was still up.
I should have left early.
Tom said she knew she shouldn't have to do this by herself.
Tom said his failure was a bad luck.
I didn't think Tom would be alone.
Tom said he wasn't planning to buy anything.
She has to be taken to hospital.
Things didn't go the way I expected.
Tom said he wouldn't get there until dark.
Tom said she knew she wanted to do that again.
I know Tom's careless.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to go to Australia.
The bus came ten minutes later.
Tom isn't home right now.
Tom said he likes shit, too.
I don't think there's any point to discussing this matter with you.
I think you shouldn't have done that by yourself.
Tom said she wouldn't want to do that until she got cooler.
I didn't think Tom was offended.
Tom said he didn't know Mary did that.
Tom said he's faster than Mary.
Tom and Mary told me they felt cold.
I didn't know Tom had to do that by himself.
We're split up the loot three ways.
I don't think Tom could do it by himself.
Tom told me that I was good.
What time is the show starting?
Tom knows she needs to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom's probably not going to joke with Mary.
I don't think Tom knows who's doing this to Mary.
All three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said he didn't know if he could do that.
I know Tom wasn't able to do that.
Keep on the next tract lights.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're lonely.
Did you fear the first time you were in airplane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs apologize.
I'm disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did so well.
Do you think you have a chance to do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There's a big supermaster.
I was suspicious, Tom.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom told me that Mary would not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure nobody can see us?
There's no solutions for this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I'm sure Tom couldn't have enough money to buy everything he wants.
Did he touch you?
Tom and Mary said they'd do that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today is the twenty of October.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary is Canadian.
Africa isn't a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me that he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree with that.
I don't have children.
I know Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book isn't so interesting.
I was told that it's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team will continue to improve.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom definitely knows he shouldn't do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn your own back.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom were working together.
Nobody knows I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more alcohol.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said she thought she was supposed to do that next time she went.
I knew Tom was the one to tell Mary not to do that.
Tom said he knew I should do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they didn't come back.
Tom doesn't know Mary's love for someone else.
I don't think Tom's worried.
I wish I had the opportunity to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom had to help us do that.
I knew Tom would be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in prison.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't have to do that by himself.
Tom said he wouldn't win.
It may be Tom may not know I'm here.
Do you think I'm strange?
Tom thinks he knows everything.
Tom said it wouldn't end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do this today.
I thought we had something to give Tom.
The cops did the work.
Tom and Mary said they didn't think of it.
You'll stay here until you are invited.
My daughter is trained toilet.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could do that.
Tom and Mary told me that they felt good.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
Nobody suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said that he shouldn't say.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they never met you.
I think Tom is a very good painter.
I know Tom's a cautioner and a little new thing.
Tom says he did nothing.
I'm sure Tom knows she's not living in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know Tom knows how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still talking.
You're a nervous.
Everybody was late except me.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Tom may be angry if you do that.
I thought Tom would do that.
I'm a Libertarian.
Can I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I never met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do this today.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing isn't as good as it was used.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admits that he was insulted.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know Tom is a little older than Mary.
Tom didn't know someone was hired to kill him.
Tom told me he couldn't eat poanuts.
I don't think Tom would like to do that.
Tom said he thought I wouldn't have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me that he thought he could do that.
Tom said she was very uncertain about that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know Tom's a horrible.
He's the most crazy boy.
How's your father?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me that she thought she was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm sure that's not what Tom meant.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary wasn't tired with her.
I'm sure Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me she didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot of books than you do.
I know Tom is about the same height as you are.
There's no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he was glad Mary didn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she would read the book she would lend him.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could have done it, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't yet told anyone they were marrying.
They said they planned to go on Monday.
It's not gonna be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone that they should do that.
I think Tom's a lot of money for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worried.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose the weight.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one I could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Anybody else's hug Tom?
Tom told me she liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to hurt me.
That's a mistake.
One way isn't better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Anybody's scared?
Tom thinks he can do anything in his mind.
We married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could do that better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
He's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary's better in French than she really is.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think Tom would do that?
That's his house.
I'm home.
You don't need to pay for your dinner.
Maybe I should try harder.
I thought Tom would do that today.
They promised to check it.
I'm sure Tom would agree.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said he knew he had to do this by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the last goal, but the process of finding it there.
Tom's gotta get a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance to hurt Tom.
Tom said he was glad you did that.
I always knew Tom was a troublemaker.
Well, I never!
Tom thinks Mary can't win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he knew Mary knew what she was planning to do.
I wonder if Tom really is home.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well.
Tom said he thought Mary was good in French.
Tom says he'll always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
I wish I was another one.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know that I supported you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in serious danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I've just had a hard egg for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next Sunday.
Tom and Mary's probably won't buy everything they need for $300.
They said they liked this year.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
They say they're refusing that deal.
I know Tom didn't know you can't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was taken.
I know Tom is a really close friend of Mary.
I know Tom didn't know who to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom wouldn't do that?
I know Tom would like to do that.
Tom's shut up his computer.
I don't think Tom knows how time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without help.
Tom and Mary say they don't really believe John's plans.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not actually saying I'm out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should.
I don't think Tom is a boss.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why he didn't do that.
I would have done it by myself if Tom didn't help me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me she thought she had done that.
Tom and Mary vowed that they would never hit me again.
Tom said he had to stay in Australia a long time.
Tom told me that they couldn't allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do that.
I don't think I should leave before Tom.
Tom said she wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy's over there reminds me of someone I knew.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I already told Tom I should do that.
I'm planning to stay home all day on Monday.
I'd like to do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could steal Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
Nobody's a contradiction, Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom is smoking what's going on?
We haven't yet been fighting.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they were supportive.
I thought it would be a great idea.
What you said is shocked to everyone.
Tom and Mary told me that they were pregnant.
Tom said he thought Mary was a mistake.
I hope nobody comes.
I thought everybody could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said she thought Mary was in her yard study.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's going to be okay.
Tom told me that it wasn't important.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I'd forget about it.
Tom told everyone that he was doing that.
They thought there was no hope.
Tom said she didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were pleased.
I thought you said you weren't happy to do that.
Tom can speak French a little.
I know Tom's a lot more than me.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that will happen.
I knew Tom wasn't busy.
I don't think I never saw Tom with Mary.
I know Tom's quicker than Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't have to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everybody has a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks she loves Mary more than John, Alice.
I wonder if Tom can do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We walk around the shadows.
I don't think it'll be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is as rich as many people think he is.
You won't do that.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been 30 years old today if he hadn't gone last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom's safe.
I know Tom didn't know he shouldn't do that here.
Do Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I didn't do that yet.
Tom said he felt like that.
I don't understand how that could happen.
You're as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom has already done enough.
Do you know anybody in Boston?
Tom said he was the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you would be happy to see me.
Tom admits that she was the one who thieved Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told to do that.
We're better telling others.
Why are everyone talking about Tom?
Federer was holding love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them.
I know Tom could save a lot of time by doing that.
Tom said he and Mary could sing together.
I didn't say anything, and it made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You're a very fucking boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A pigeon with some cabbs is in heaven.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that.
Who sends letters by mail?
If something sounds so good to be true, then it's probably.
Tom said you wouldn't want to do that.
Tom said he wasn't there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not hurry.
We may have to be in Australia for a few weeks.
I hadn't planned to do it, but if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said she was expecting Mary to participate.
I'm swimming every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They thought they didn't know me.
I know Tom's a shorter than Mary.
Tom will do that if nobody stops him.
I'm sure Tom will not do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know, Tom and I don't do that, don't you?
Tom and Mary told me that they finished it by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have left there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought you couldn't do that.
Tom said he had forgotten something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do it, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew Tom knew who to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom is a better driver than me.
I thought you loved Tom.
This isn't the current technology.
They said they're trying to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office is French.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do it by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that.
I think you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was cold.
You have a sense of humour, I like that.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to talk.
I think Tom's gonna refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's 40 years old.
Can you eat a omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
Nobody asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk any more.
I wonder if we can do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us.
I don't think Tom is capable of that.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Tom's going to meet a girl who's three years older than her.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't want to do that.
I know Tom's gonna be interested in doing that.
I think Tom's gonna like this wine.
I believe we're talking about the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a lot of truth he says.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom's a slope.
He's not a virturo.
I doubt Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually do that.
Tom told me she'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't yet told Mary what to do.
I know Tom is a good diamond.
It's not easy to trust anyone.
I knew I should stay home.
I don't think that's enough food to feed us all.
He's not the sharp knife in the drawer.
Tom said he's planning to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends are not here.
A wolf can't be complete.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what to do.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I don't know I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't pay.
Are you worried about that happening?
I know Tom doesn't know Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your hobrella when you leave here.
I'll see that it's done.
I'm wearing a suit, but I don't wear any tie.
I'm tired as you do.
Tom thought he could come down with a cold.
I think Tom hates me.
I should have apologized.
You're a lucky you didn't hurt.
Where's Tom and Mary planning to live?
This tree is more than a hundred years old.
Tom didn't want anyone to be mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
You sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary's always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't do.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.
We're all in the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do it.
I'm drowning last night.
Tom isn't so good at the howling.
Tom said Mary gave her something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
Tom told me she thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you're paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You're both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom's actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he had a lot of food.
We're all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that soon.
Have I ever told you about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was 30 years old.
Tom said he didn't want to play with Mary.
I know Tom's gonna let you do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom told me that Mary knew that John would not have to do this by himself.
I wonder if Tom's moved.
Tom said he would do that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you had to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like if Mary did that.
I still want you to do that.
Let me know Mary wasn't planning to stay too long.
I didn't know you would be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait for that long.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom may be lonely.
Tom said she thought she wasn't very busy.
I'm absolutely sure that will not happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom doesn't have any idea where Mary's planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them.
You're so disturbing.
I have already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn't be a good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You finished your housework, didn't you?
What could it have happened?
I don't think Tom knows if she likes Mary.
I lost in the wood.
I know Tom's a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me she'll be in Boston next Wednesday.
Keep your mouth shut up!
Tom said he knew he was supposed to do this on Monday.
Tom said he regretted what happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary that she had to do that.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
You got a pen on you?
Tom let Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents don't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time she's going to do this.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn't you eat the food I had eaten?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried his father's clothes.
I'm sure Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he was trying to do that all weeks.
You have a really beautiful teeth!
Nobody knew that Tom was a man who gave most of the money.
Everybody knew Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was disappointed.
Tom and I were a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that it was going to happen.
Tom told me that he thought he could do that.
I admit what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Did you know that Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a little problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's already done that.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should do that.
There must be a reason for Tom's not here.
It's not appropriate to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me that Mary could run faster than she could.
Tom said Mary was scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know Tom is a farm, but I don't know where her farm is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like that.
What's wrong?
Nobody can stop that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I'd do it, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom's overmost.
I'm immune to littlepox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my coffee.
My class was canceled.
Tom and Mary told me that it was going through the time they were here.
Tom promised me he would be here by 2:30.
Tom said she thought she could take care of herself.
It's not as cold as I expected it to be here.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'm alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to start.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I think Tom won't be surprised.
I know Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was jealous.
Anyone else knows you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said she thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I know Tom knew who would do this for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do it without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think she was injured by Mary.
No one's back.
Tom probably said Mary would do that.
I met someone who knew we were.
Tom said he thought these shoes were very expensive.
Tom said he knew he shouldn't do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried about Tom's going to lose.
They told me they were next.
I'm sure Tom and Mary aren't eager to do that now as they were.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to say to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't tickling.
I know Tom did that to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smart than that.
We're sorry for the unnecessary.
That's not the main reason I want to do it.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm awful.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't do that.
Tom and Mary told me that they had a lot of food.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he thought he had forgotten the door.
I know Tom is afraid people might laugh at him.
Tom said she was still mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.
Tom said he couldn't be sure Mary could fly.
I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom is the only one to do that.
I didn't think you would win.
I don't think Tom will have time to do this with us today.
I know Tom's very thinking.
We can't let these stars move us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew who Tom could do this and who couldn't do it.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everybody knows we're not eating pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't do that.
I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.
I already told Tom that I don't plan to do that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not good to have dinner.
I'm glad to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I'm sure Tom and Mary are those who did that.
I'm sure I can sit here more than you can.
It hasn't been done yet.
I know Tom isn't on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
Tom just turned the radio.
Tom has already decided he won't say yes.
I know Tom's a bit smoking.
What's in the box?
Tom said she knew she wouldn't want to do it by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said that if he could.
Proving that there is a problem is the first step to handle the problem.
Mary said she was planning to go.
Tom told me that she thought Mary would be out.
Tom said Mary was lying.
I don't think Tom would be disappointed if I did that.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't be there.
They said they thought I could win.
Tom means to everyone, isn't he?
Tom isn't really in Boston now.
I hope I could get a mail from you today.
I thought Tom was outpressed.
Tom isn't a suspect anymore.
There's nothing here.
I thought Tom didn't do that well.
I knew Tom would do that right now.
Why didn't you go to Boston?
Tom said he won't do that again.
Tom said that he was very happy.
I know Tom could get Mary to show us how to do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's gonna say yes.
I was afraid I could be late for the bus.
You're not allowed to bring dogs into this building.
Tom and Mary vowed that they wouldn't do that.
I know I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
You're welcome.
I couldn't believe it was so fast.
You think it was just?
You think Tom will keep his promise?
I don't think I have any chance to do that.
I know Tom's a bastard.
Tom admits he ate all the ice cream.
Tom would have missed the train if he stopped buying a chocolate bar.
Tom told Mary that she should do that for some time today.

Do you have a vegetarian plaf?
I know you need to go to Boston.

I thought Tom would know how to do that.

This book is worth reading it twice.
Tom said he thought Mary would be ready to do that.
I wish that happened.
It won't hurt.

You look like you don't have fun.
I thought you wanted to go to Australia.

Stop criticing me!

I'm looking for you.
Tom said he knew I wouldn't cry.
Tom said we couldn't do anything about it.
I think Tom's just curious.
Everyone knows that Tom was the one who broke the window.
Here's my pink notebook.
I knew I could trust you!
I don't think Tom knows what he wants.
I didn't know that Tom didn't have to do it by himself.
It's not like Tom's going anywhere.
Tom told me she was hesitated to do that.
I thought I didn't know what to do.
I know Tom is a bum.
I didn't think Tom would let you do that.
I want to go and change that buddy I bought yesterday.
Tom said he thought Mary was lying.
We should stay with you.
I don't think Tom is lonely.
This isn't the first time I did it.
If Tom can't do that, probably nobody else can do it.
I thought Tom could stop this afternoon.
I think the economic effect will be less.
You should let Tom know that Mary's gonna do that.
It would have been fun to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning to do that anymore.
I don't think Tom will need our help.
Tom said Mary was a nervous feeling.
Tom and Mary said they were more hot.
I think Tom wanted Mary to stay.

Did you know Tom was planning to move to Boston?

Tom said he thought Mary wasn't done that.
I thought it was what we had to do.
I would never do that for you.
Tom should have made it quicker than Mary.
Tom and Mary said they were planning for Monday.
It's not what Tom really needs.
They know they can do better.
No way Tom did what you said.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that anymore.
You're tired, aren't you?
Did Tom do that by himself?
Tom and Mary said they used to study French.
Tom admits she'd killed Mary.
I would have been there now if my car wasn't broken.
We're brothers.
I wrote a long letter to Tom.
It'll be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I don't think it's a good idea to give Tom a knife.
I thought you were going to kill me.
I think there's a possibility that Tom will do it.
It's surprising that they have a second house in America.
They told me they were depressed.
My mom can't drive a car.
There's a lot that happens now.
I wonder if Tom is rich.
I don't need to do that.
I didn't think nobody noticed what Tom did.
I think you're boss.
Tom returned his car to check, but the raccoon running over was dead as a doornail.
Tom and Mary said they're not mad.
I wonder if Tom ever told Mary about what we were doing that day.
Close that door.
The only reason Tom went to Australia because everyone in his family did it.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to the promising.
Are you sure nobody can see us?
He has a great fancy to travel.
Tom said she was still in prison.
I'm not sure Tom would help anyone else, Mary.

I'm surprised Tom didn't want to go with us.
I asked Tom and Mary if they knew anyone who was taught French.
Tom must have left her hopebella on the bus.
They told me they were broken.
No one else, Tom did that.
I don't think Tom's gonna be surprised.
I think you're not interested in going with us.
It's not easy to understand everyone.
I'm hungry.
Tom said he was the only one to do that.
I thought you might want something cold to drink.
Tom told me she wouldn't go to Boston unless I went with him.
No one saw them.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was sleeping.
Tom said he would do that in this week.
That's not my responsibility.
I think Tom is a student in Harvard.
I didn't know I was doing that wrong way.
That's the best thing anyone ever did for me.
Tom told Mary that she didn't think she was happy that John was going to happen.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would have come soon.
They said they would do it for us.
I thought you were just the little girls who were shorter than you.
Tom said he thought he was very high on that store.
Tom said he didn't feel like eating.
Tom spends a lot of money he never uses.
I thought you said I could count you.
Tom said he sold his car three weeks ago.
Tom gave her grandmother on books.
This is the first time I left my family for more than three weeks.
You should have said that at that time.
Tom and Mary say they'll just talk to you.
Tom told me she hadn't even more friends like Mary.
I made my car a lot of times here and nobody complained.
Tom said he was sad.
Tom said she didn't think she didn't think she needed to tell John what to do.
Tom said he was going home.
I didn't know Tom would be arrested.
I know I'm gonna regret that.
Tom thought Mary was stupid.
Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that.
Do you have any idea when Tom's planning to get here?
I know you're not planning to stay at Boston.
I wonder if this could happen again.
I doubt Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't keep looking at it.
I think Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
The available evidence doesn't allow me to make such a claim.
Tom said he's very sure Mary had to do that.
Tom would be happy if you did that.
Tom said he wanted to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom said he needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.
I could have stopped it.
It's not good to eat and run.
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven.
Tom told me not to do that.
We're invited to dinner.
Tom and Mary said they were disappointed.
I know Tom's afraid she'll be lost.
I ate the same thing Tom did.
I know Tom would be able to convince Mary if she tried to do that.
Tom thinks I'm missing a great opportunity.
I know Tom's not a good guitar player.
Tom and I were both impressed.
Everybody knows Tom is lying.
They're not young as they say they are.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Did you know Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I never thought I would go there.
You know that's not true.
I know Tom and Mary have already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same.
Tom's probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was wrong.
Tom decided he wouldn't work today.
Tom denied that she was the one who asked Mary to do that.
I wish I could speak French and Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It's not going to work.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom told me that Mary thought John would not be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom and I told Mary that we should try to do this by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I couldn't do that without your help.
I knew Tom didn't really want to do that.
Tom said he's looking forward to his rent.
Whether we do this now or later, it doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should have imagined Tom wouldn't be with Mary.
I think it's very unlikely Tom didn't know that he would not be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination for this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary doesn't plan to do that until I tell her.
I didn't know you were supposed to do that afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that could be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know Mary was living in Boston.
I didn't know you needed to do that today.
You should have sent your kids before a month ago.
I think that's not mine.
I believe Tom's 30 years old.
Think about it.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
I didn't think anyone would like Tom.
I thought Tom could be the only one who knew Mary was where she lived.
I didn't think nobody ever did something like this before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to stay.
It's not something I know how to do.
I think I can fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.
Tom said we'd lose.
Tom said he should do that.
You're sure Mary's planning to do that tomorrow?
There were times when I lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was mad.
Tom already knows Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I will not tell anyone where you are.
It's not going to end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all the caves.
Tom's gonna be so happy he didn't do that.
I don't think Tom should do that alone.
If I were you, I would go home once.
It's not like you know what they're gonna do.
Tom and I are planning to stay together.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
So what are you recommending?
Tom said he learned a new thing.
I know Tom's married.
Tom said he thought the economy was in a bad shape.
I thought you were jury-riged something.
I've been studying English for three years.
Tom's the only man I ever thought of marry.
I didn't think Tom would be awake when I came home.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was plyzzed.
I know Tom's not planning this.
Tom didn't know you were from Boston.
It's not as difficult as sounds.
Tom and Mary shouted, but no one heard them.
Tom and Mary say they want to swim.
Tom said she was still lonely.
I didn't think Tom would be arrested.
Tom told Mary that she wasn't planning to join the team.
You promised no more to be unkind to me.
Tom thought it would be too long.
I wonder if Tom knew he needed to do that.
I think Tom's like that.
Tom had all kinds of problems.
I knew Tom would like you to do that for him.
I thought Tom would like to see this movie.
I think Tom is still unfortunate.
I'm Tom's father.
I just want you to know that you're the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
Tom said he would do his homework before dinner.
Tom looked at Mary and said nothing.
I wonder if Tom really sleeps.
Tom and Mary said they want to die.
Tom said he had enough of that.
I'm sure Tom's on vacation.
Tom told me that he was too tired to study tonight, so he just wanted to watch TV.
I don't think Tom is so bright.
Tom said he thought Mary had to do this before John came here.
It would be easy to do that.
Tom said he thought he was supposed to do it by himself.
That's very good.
Tom says he wasn't the one who broke the window.
It was clear that Tom was going to do that.
They don't know they should do that.
The type we need is not always available.
I don't want to talk about it.
I didn't think anyone saw us.
We can't go back.
I know Tom knows we shouldn't do that.
You didn't know I had to do that, did you?
Tom wondered that it was too late to help Mary.
Tom and I both sit back.
Tom was wearing the tie that Mary gave him.
Tom and Mary said they were not alone.

I know that would be hard to do.
How are you planning to do that?

I'm a little out of shape!
Didn't you know Tom was seeing someone else?
It'll be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were beautiful.
I thought you learned it now.

I always doubted Tom was a little paranoid.
I know Tom knew I was going to do that.
You should have done that better.
We're working every day, but Monday.
I know you weren't those who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
I know Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not hard.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was marrying.
Tom told me she would cry.
I thought they would find someone else.
I was the only one who knew Tom didn't want to do that.
I'm very sure Tom did it for his purpose.
I thought you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do it by ourselves.
I don't think that's an exception.
I know you don't like me so much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about this today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something about that last night.
Tom admits he wasn't brave.
I know I had to do that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I doubt Tom's waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't break.

Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She didn't take his eyes away.
Tom isn't like mirrors as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do it by ourselves.
Tom says she's still planning to do that.
I thought Tom should be a mistake.
Tom said she didn't care what she did.
They said they didn't like it.
Tom was the reason for Mary to move to Boston.
I should have met myself.
Tom said she's looking forward to being exhausted.
I can't remember when she moved to Boston.
I never fall in love with anyone.
That's the first time Tom ever complained about it.
Tom likes everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He doesn't have a mobile.
I think Tom's gonna ask you to marry him.
Tom told me that John would not be allowed to do that by himself.
You don't need Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom is involved.
How many kiloss have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are okay.
I'm a disgusting human being.
I will never forget the time you and I went together to Australia.
Tom's not the only one who plans to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary both decided not to leave.
Tom told me she's sleeping.
Mary tried on her mother's clothes.
Tom admits that she kicked Mary's bicycle.
I ran away from the lied.
Tom said she was going to be in Australia now.
Tom said he didn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you.
When is your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would help you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were married already.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you were fun.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been in a dinner for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us.
Tom thought Mary had a driver's license already.
I know Tom's a good drummer.
Tom realized he couldn't change anything.
Tom said Mary had to do that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy air.
Didn't you know Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I suspect Tom's home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me that they would do it again.
Tom's thrown down.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to marry Tom.
I didn't know there was a swiming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they don't care.
Tom didn't stay in Boston as long as he wanted.
Tom said he was a Canadian.
I'd like to have another coffee coffee.
I think Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone knows that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know Tom could do that for some time today.
Do you let your children play on the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the chair.
I think Tom's unusual.
I don't think Tom knows when it's happening.
Is Tom moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess today.
I don't think I would like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary had to do that by himself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was misled.
What you say is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary's suspicious.
They said they didn't enjoy it.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they would never learn French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he didn't know what to do.
Tom told me I should say yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
Nothing left in the fridge.
Tom said he knew Mary shouldn't have to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak very well of French.
I don't think there's any chance I can get there at the time.
I think both Tom and Mary will be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I should do that.
Tom said she didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he wasn't planning to go with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom is sure Mary wants to do that.
Tom told me that he couldn't buy what he needed for hundreds of dollars.
Everybody loves free stuff.
I don't think that's funny.
If Tom does that, I'll do it.
I know Tom is still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they were ready to help me.
Tom isn't the one who told me that Mary should do that.
I thought you'd still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do that.
They say they're not planning.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom told him that she should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's offended.
I don't think I can't hold it a long time.
Tom's not like Mary.
Tom said he didn't think Mary's cold.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom that I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me she wouldn't be able to attend the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to call it.
Tom said he knew Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights down, please.
Tom said it's a nice place to visit Australia.
I thought Tom was in great trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's talking for three hours.
I wonder if Tom is alive.
I'm trying to borrow a pochet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anybody wants to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom will not be in Australia a long time.
Tom told Mary that she would never come back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that by yourself.
I'm sure Tom will never agree.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wanted to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is insurmountable.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know Tom's probably doing this today more than he's yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something wrong.
Our streets are drought when we get rain.
I'll probably be busy afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choices.
Tom said he thought he could do it on October 20.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was going to do this.
I knew Tom could be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of the cake.
I know Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Nobody here has done this except Tom.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everybody has a idea about what Tom can do.
Tom knew he could do that better.
Tom said she wouldn't do that anymore.
Tom told me that Mary was disappointed.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've done enough for everyone.
I know Tom is the one to tell Mary that she should do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do it by ourselves.
You say you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that this will not happen.
Tom's plans to sit back.
Tom said he was given a book to Mary.
It would have been unlikely.
I know Tom's gonna know how to do that.
I know Tom was a kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're guilty.
I'm not surprised that Tom's plans.
Well, nobody expected Tom to win.
Don't hurt my words!
I didn't think Tom was going to see how hard that job would be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put your jacket down if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom said she wasn't planning to stay in Australia too long.
I hear you quit smoking.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing that.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me she thought she was divorced.
Tom told me she was next.
Tom told me that Mary knew John had to do this by himself.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
This isn't salt.
Anyone here, Tom?
Tom told me she thought she was wrong.
My dogs sleep in the same room I do.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he's planning to do that.
I doubt Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I'm sure Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-definitely.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was careful.
Tom was sleeping on the living room.
I found both Tom and Mary like romance romants.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I doubted Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone he was ready to do that.
We'll go on a picnic tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone.
It's not Tom who needs protection, it's Mary.
They said they were angry.
I think Tom's gonna be able to do that.
Tom did that every time he could.
They said their house wasn't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I think we have something more important to do now.
I think Tom and Mary were at least one time to Boston.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew she was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should stop sleeping.
Can someone help me?
I know Tom's the same age as your daughter.
I know Tom is a very lucky man.
Tom thought I couldn't be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's easy to go.
I think Tom's gonna be lonely.
It looks like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary's got to get into her new floor.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom to do that.
They swore that they would never do that.
Everybody stood there, shocked.
I'm hoping to hear why you think we should do that.
Tom told me that he wasn't offended.
I'm sorry I didn't be careful as I should.
Tom doesn't look so good.
Tom said he thought I should do it by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard sounds in the mutchen.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary's sleepy or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised to do that, didn't you?
They wished they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I saw Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they didn't like it.
I thought Tom would have found Mary right now.
Tom said she wouldn't think if she did that.
You shouldn't just think Tom is guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning this.
Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know how Tom did that when he was hot.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
It's enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know Tom did that?
I think it's like everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It's not until you lose your health until you understand its value.
That could have shot me.
They told me they're losing the weight.
My house isn't big.
I'm sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was still planning to join the team, did you?
The bathroom wasn't too clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think she could ever get Mary out with him.
Tom thought Mary was the first one to do that.
Tom told me that she thought she was prestigeous.
That's what I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this music.
Tom said he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wanted to speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom doesn't have a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know Tom knew I was the one to do that.
Tom doesn't miss, is he?
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did something bad.
I doubt Tom would be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom to do that.
I thought Tom would never come up.
That's so good to be true.
Tom said that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I shouldn't have broken with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom broke his dog with some bread.
What's this to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know I had to do that.
That's not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm sure I can do that.
Tom says she and Mary will spend Christmas together.
Why did you fail in the entry examining?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me she had to leave.
Tom says she couldn't prove that she did it.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were tired.
Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought she was really Mary.
I know there's a lot of good food in the picnic.
Is there any questions that anybody has so far?
I suspect Tom is not a reluctant to do that.
Tom never feared anyone.
They said they'd like to come next week.
What are you talking about?
Tom said he thought Mary was occupied by what was going on.
Everybody in the room did the same thing.
They're not independent.
Tom didn't know you were the one you wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You should have done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that to happen.
It would be wise to do that.
Tom told me she didn't have a problem with that.
Tom said she shouldn't go home by himself.
Tom has to be angry.
How long has your head been hurt?
Thank you, bud!
Tom said nobody was fired.
You think we should go to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He's got a drink.
I don't think Tom wants to do it by himself.
I don't know I can trust Tom.
Tom said she had told him that she needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life without parole.
I think that the weapon I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was high.
I know Tom is a millioner.
Tom said he thought this would be safe.
I don't think I'm gonna let Tom do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I did it.
I think Tom doesn't eat meat.
I hope we have no problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
That's the first time Tom ever complained about the voice.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unusual for you to do that.
Tom said he was the only one who knew Mary where she lived.
I know we can't trust Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom lost Mary a month ago.
I think Tom wouldn't be the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom's downstairs.
I need to know we can depend on Tom.
Tom told Mary that she wouldn't be allowed to do that.
I know that it's not really happening.
They say the drug isn't safe.
I know it's very unlike anybody can help me.
I think Tom's going to call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said that he thought it would be a great mistake to tell Mary what happened.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't weep.
This is enough to break me back.
That would never happen if you did what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wants to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Anybody has a clenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could be a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a episolianic.
I wouldn't say anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I'm both wrong.
I think you're still enjoying drinking a beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary could do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should talk to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You're not obligated to do that, are you?
You have a big head.
He's very clever.
I wouldn't have kicked Tom.
Do Tom know you've already done that?
Tom's eating more than I eat.
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom says Mary is still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I would do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave anymore.
I know Tom will never do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to suffer if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know, Tom told Mary that she wouldn't do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
My time is taken by teaching and study.
I think Tom's been concentrated.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did it.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary can't do that.
They say they're gonna stop doing that.
Tom's not cool.
Tom thinks Mary's drinking like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary told you.
Tom said she thought Mary couldn't do that.
I know Tom is a golf, maybe he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew Tom could do that without help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else do you plan to do?
I think Tom understands everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom's talking.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're ready to help.
I think you'd like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary gets back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom wasn't a bad student.
Unlike Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
You think we'll never get our way back to the camps?
Tom doesn't know I have three caves.
I should have quit while I was in the future.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door close.
My grandmother text is faster than you.
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you would do that for Tom.
I didn't think nobody noticed what you did.
I wonder if I can help Tom.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know that's not hard.
I doubt Tom and Mary are not ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I thought Tom told you I'd be here.
You know Tom's going to be in Australia every week?
Tom said he didn't know Mary would eventually leave her.
You're still not afraid, are you?
I thought you would cry.
The value of health cannot be overturned.
You're going to suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows how much she'll get.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know Tom's nice.
Tom already knows Mary's planning to do that.
Don't take your gloves off.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wouldn't do that again.
Tom had to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary felt sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was a friendly person.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know, Tom isn't the one who has to do that.
I admit I've been disappointed, Tom, since I first met him.
Is there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the TV on?
Tom said Mary wasn't good.
It's true that the earth is rotten.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak well in French.
Check that girl.
Tom told Mary that she should quit being handed up.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
Tom thinks it's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a wise man.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I didn't want to admit that I couldn't do it.
Tom said he was ready to do what he needed.
Tom said she owes a lot of money to Mary.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat with you.
It's not safe to go out after you're dark.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Tom knows Mary, Boston.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't win.
Tom told me that he was forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one way of action.
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I never decided to do that again.
I didn't know you were Tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they don't need to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know Tom doesn't know he's gonna do that today.
Tom and Mary say they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
You don't know everyone's talking about us?
Tom said she knew she didn't want to do that to the next Sunday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom's sad.
I don't think Tom will win.
I'd like to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone that he was determined to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was striking.
Tom said he thought Mary was supposed to do this by himself.
We wish we could do more to help.
Tom said he thought it would be snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he would look at it.
Tom said that it was harder than he thought it would be.
You would like the movie.
They told me they didn't really care about what happened.
Tom's speech wasn't long before Mary was.
I didn't know Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I'm worried about you.
Everybody seems to be scared, but you are.
Tom was afraid that his parents would start asking him questions, and he would end up telling them everything.
Was the book you read in French yesterday?
I'm a damn fucker.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said he didn't think she'd think she's hurt at Mary's smell.
He thinks I love her.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see Tom's happy again.
I thought Tom had already left.
I knew Tom couldn't keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have a lot of time.
Tom said she's trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would have done it for me.
Tom is the most funny person I ever met.
I'm sure Tom's really planning to do that.
Tom said she thought she shouldn't have to do that this week.
I know Tom didn't need to do that.
To tell the truth, I'm not your father.
I don't think Tom will do that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, right?
I thought you could go home.
Tom said she'd hoped Mary's trying to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom had to do that this morning.
Tom says she knows Mary can't speak very well of French.
Tom didn't tell me where he was planning to stay in Boston.
Tom didn't have to come here.
They said they enjoyed the challenge.
I know Tom was late.
Tom told me she was going home.
Tom told me he lost his textbook.
Nobody knew Tom's going to do that.
That's right!
I thought I should do that.
I'm sure Tom doesn't have any brothers.
I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that.
I'm sure that's not going to happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary really tell the truth.
Do you all think that's a good idea?
It must have been broken during shiping.
They said that they could not win.
Tom said he thought Mary was a good dinner.
They didn't admit that they had done it yet.
Unless Tom knew he had to go to Boston.
I knew Tom knew why Mary should do that yesterday.
I know Tom is someone we can trust.
If I could talk better French, I could have got that job.
Do you feel OK today?
Tom and Mary said they could do that.
These turtles aren't in California.
Tom told me she didn't want to go to Boston.
They said they were Canadian.
I know you feel grateful.
I know Tom is a prison guard.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do anything John asks him to do.
Tom said he hoped he could buy what he needed for $300.
Tom said she was the only one who had to do that.
Both Tom and Mary joined the army when they were eight.
Tom knew who she did that for Mary.
Or a week smell the roses.
Tom said he didn't like dogs.
Tom told me he thinks he'll win tomorrow.
I'm really tired of living.
Tom thought Mary's dress wasn't appropriate for the event.
Do you have kids?
Tom said he's glad he didn't do that.
I wonder if Tom's really finished.
I don't think nobody can do that.
Did you know that Tom and Mary were still planning to do that?
Tom told me that she was too young to drive.
I'll be back.
I don't think Tom's nosy.
I wouldn't have done that.
I believe we don't really need to do that.
Tom could have made it quicker than Mary if she tried harder.
I knew Tom told Mary that she wouldn't do that.
I think you're wrong.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was deaf.
I don't think I'm going out today because it's so cold.
Tom certainly made it clear that Mary didn't want to attend the party.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to do that.
Tom said he didn't forget to buy Mary's birthday present.
I wonder if Tom wants to play poker with us.
I don't think nobody can do that.
I thought we were already over this.
I know Tom is a very smarter than me.
Tom said she shouldn't be sure Mary should do that.
I don't think Tom's going to Boston with us.
Tom said he thought Mary was a good dinner.
Tom felt someone touching his shoulder.
I know Tom's not a history teacher, I think he's a science teacher.
Who planned to stay with Tom?
Tom thought everyone knew what to do.
Someone stole my dinner.
I know Tom won't tell Mary why she's doing that.
Tom wasn't the one who told me Mary to do that.
Tom doesn't know anything about the plan.
Tom told me that he had some things to take care of.
I didn't know I had enough time to do what to do.
Tom said he knew Mary wanted to do that.
Tom told me he was busy on Monday.
I didn't want the kids to wake up.
I know I'll be arrested.
That's more like it!
I think you could do it by yourself.
Did you know Tom won't win?
Tom said he thought Mary was in danger.
I didn't think anyone could do that.
How do we know you're not lying to us?
I think you all agree, Tom is one of our best beards.
Tom didn't know Mary was in pain.
If I could, I would go to Boston.
You were planning to take photos, didn't you?
I don't think Tom knows what to buy.
He's happy.
Tom said she knew she had a good time in Boston.
Gods are pleased with your actions.
I don't feel so good.
I thought it would be hard to do that.
I'm sure Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm sure Tom hasn't done anything wrong.
I know Tom wouldn't have to do that anymore.
Tom said she was happy that she didn't do that.
You're not a city girl, are you?
They said they'd be there.
He knows we've done everything we can.
I think Tom's gonna want to see it.
Why do all think Tom and I are stupid?
Life isn't fair.
You should have seen Tom's face when I told him what Mary did.
Tom couldn't get out of his socks.
I don't think Tom can win.
I think Tom didn't see me yesterday.
What makes you think I'm lying?
A stone is heavy on its own cycle.
Tom's already decided he wouldn't stay here.
I'll make you a sandwich if you want one.
It would be better if you hadn't gone there.
Tom said he was really happy you could do that.
You're not going to give up, are you?
Tom said he wouldn't go home today.
Most people think they're upstairs.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was tickling.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was going through the time we got there.
He went to America for the last year to blossom his English.
Tom probably said Mary wouldn't do that.
Tom will never want to do that on a day like this.
Tom never said he had a girlfriend.
I knew Tom wasn't a very good singer.
I didn't know you knew French.
Tom said he wanted to change it.
Why didn't you just say you didn't want to do that?
It's good you don't have to study so hard.
I don't think Tom should sing.
I wonder if Tom can help us.
Tom told me that he wasn't interested in the museum.
Tom has a lot of toys.

I don't think Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
You couldn't do that well.
Tom told me she was impressed.
What's going on there?
I know Tom won't do that tomorrow.
I don't think Tom did that as many times as Mary did.
They said they felt that they wanted to do that.
The atomic number of iron is 26.
Is this the first time you've been smashed?
You better go get dressed.
It's a complete disaster.
They say they don't have fun.
I wish I went to Australia with Tom.
You don't answer me.
I didn't think Tom would help me.
Both Tom and Mary need this.
Tom probably thought Mary did that.
I thought I should do that.
Do Tom and Mary know you did that?
Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary's supposed to do that.
Tom thinks I'm a loss.
Tom knows he should do that soon.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna leave.
I think Tom didn't expect to be here so long.
They told me they're fine.
Tom is one of the strangest men I know.
I'm not gonna tell anyone you were here.
Tom said he could speak French, but he can't really speak it.
Do you think Tom knew that this would happen?
Tom said he wanted his son wasn't so hard.
I know Tom is a crazy kid.
How long do you think I need to stay in Boston?
Tom and his wife have no children.
Tom said he knew Mary couldn't do that.
I don't think I did and the teacher expected me.

It's not like you have anything else to do.
I hope I didn't get you in any trouble.

They said they felt amazing.
Tom and Mary say they can do it.
The museum isn't open on Monday.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was stubborn.
I thought we had talked about it already.
Tom admits that she's letting Mary win.
Tom said he was glad you did that.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't realize Mary was waiting for him.
Tom's the only person in our office who doesn't speak French.
That's so bad, it's good.
Tom and Mary both decided to stay.
It seems to me that you're mistaken.
I thought you would laugh.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
They said that the explosion woke them up.
I didn't know you were planning to do that with Tom.
Tom thought Mary was homeick.
They say they enjoy teaching French.
Tom didn't tell anyone he needed to do that.
Tom said he wasn't sleeping.
I thought Tom paid Mary, but I was probably wrong.
Please wake me up in six in the morning.
I wonder why Tom gave me this.
Where's my beer?
I wonder if Tom told Mary not to do that.
I can't believe Tom would do that.
Tom said Mary's accident wasn't his fault.
Tom thought it was a fool question.
Tom said he wasn't ready to talk.
Nobody knew that.
I don't think I can eat all of this.
Tom said that could cause problems.
Everybody's doing good.
Tom told Mary that she didn't think it was John's going to happen.
Tom said he was forced to do that.
Tom became nervous.
I just bought half of what I needed to buy.
Tom told me he wasn't down.
I want to believe there's still a chance to be happy together.
You're not fooling anybody.
He doesn't want to live in a small country.
I didn't know Tom like to have dinner.
Tom thinks there's a chance Mary won't be at the meeting.
You're not in trouble, are you?
Tom doesn't think that's going to happen.
I don't trust anyone except myself.
I don't think Tom will be ready to do that.
I know Tom and Mary aren't usually taking vacations together.
I'll eat it.
I don't think everyone gave up.
I thought everyone was busy.
Tom knows Mary won't cry.
Tom told me that she thought Mary would be jealous.
I'm not planning to do that again.
The boss said we were fired.
You stay here.
I know Tom's gonna be crazy.
I think Tom didn't want to leave that early.
Leave the dog out!
Tom said she'd probably be a little dissatisfiable.
I was suspicious that Tom couldn't have enough money to buy anything he wanted.
Tom may be the last one to do that.
I know Tom doesn't know I can't do that.
They said they would write to us.
Tom and Mary said they were artists.
Tom's the only one who wasn't at Mary's party.

Tom told me she couldn't walk.
You really have hair.

I wonder if Tom knows Mary wants to do that.
I don't think it's the fault of anyone.
Tom can move far better than me.
You already have plans for the New Year Eve?
Tom said he knew he had to do that.
I thought you said nobody would be here.
I'm sure Tom will know the answer.

It's a good thing Tom did it.
That's MY line!

Tom said he thought he would find another job.
Tom said nobody was hungry.
I'm sure Tom is still single.
Tom told everyone he was thirsty.
I don't think we should stay in the same hotel for the last time.
Did you even know that his name was Tom?
I should kiss Mary.
I thought you said Tom saw that.
Tom said she thought she could do that tonight.
It must have been a shock for you.
Tom and I were both wrong.
All of our blood goes through our kidneys for sixty times a day.
I don't think that's a bad idea.
He pressed his finger against the glass.
I don't think anyone really thought Tom was happy.
We should go to Boston last month.
Tom's gotta do that anywhere else.
I don't think Tom would ever marry someone like Mary.
I need a doctor!
Tom thought it wasn't the first time Mary did it.
I don't think it's good.
It's amazing.
I wonder if Tom really plans to quit his job.
If I could prove that Tom did, I would fire him.
I eat every chance I get.
I will never break a law again.
I don't think I can reassure Tom to stop doing that.
Tom didn't tell anyone who was.
Tom told me that Mary would be the first one to do that.
I thought Tom lived in Boston.
Tom said he knew Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he wanted to spend more money on Mary's gift.

Tom said he would help me.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are married.
Mary told Tom what he was planning.

I'm sorry I forgot to tell Tom what to do.
Tom said she was planning to do this by herself.
Mary's a bracelet.
Mary tried on her wedding dress.
They told me they were happy here.
I think Tom wouldn't be fun of what's going on.

Tom should have let his children come with us.
I wonder if Tom's friends will help him.
How did you know I used to do that?
Tom said Mary wasn't fun.

Tom said nobody was hungry.
They say they've been studying French.
I'm a doctor.
It's not like I'm trying to avoid Tom.

Tom told me that his father was a teacher too.
The decision is not yet late.
I knew Tom knew who to do that.
Tom admits that she was disgusted, Mary.
I didn't know Tom lived in the Dormitory.
I'm sure Tom's right.

Everyone's here except you are from Australia.
I think Tom's here already.
I'm not going to work today because I have to take my son to the hospital.
Is that your car?
Tom's looking for someone to teach his children French.
Tom said he doesn't have enough time to do that.
Go and see if Mr Wilson is home.
I think Tom is just.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary that she wouldn't do that.
Tom must have been hungry.
Tom and Mary should have told John that they were married.

Red, yellow, and blue colors.
I know Tom is a good drummer.
Tom thinks Mary was in Australia.

This bridge is built of stones.
I didn't know why Tom was doing that.
There's no doubt.
I know I made a mistake, but you don't need to jump it in!
Tom's the best.
I don't think Tom will take care of it.
Both Tom and Mary are afraid of John's dog.
I thought Tom would want to do that.
Mary knows she's attractive.

Tom told me that she thought she was dirty.
I should have told you about this before.
I know you should be scared.
Tom told me that Mary was living in Boston.
Tom and Mary say they're not happy here.
You should have been a little more polite.

I knew something wasn't right.
I know Tom's gonna want to do that.
We'll be part of the marathon.
Tom is a germaphobe.
I don't think anyone's gonna like Tom.
You've had the best way to follow the doctor's advice.
Tom said he thought Mary was hard to get together.
I think Tom's offensive.
Tell Tom should go to Australia.
Tom and Mary said they felt disappointed.
I still make a lot of mistakes.
He's walking a lot.
I didn't think Tom would ever forgive Mary for doing that.
Tom has a car, but he uses it a little.
Let's go for some ramen.
I'm sure I'm right.
Tom told me I'm the last one.
Tom may not be willing to do that for you.
I thought you wouldn't like to do it.
I wonder if Tom could help us solve this problem.
I don't know if Tom and Mary still live in Boston.
Tom said he never thought he would ever do that.
I hope Tom's coming to Australia with you.
Water freezs at 0 degrees Centigrade.
The bread I bought in the supermaster doesn't taste very good.
In Japan, the new year begins in April.

I hope you have the opportunity to do that.
Tom gave me a lot of money.
I wish I could speak French.
Tom told me that he did it for us.
Tom likes playing with this dog.
I'm wasting my time.
Tom told Mary to do this in the other room.
I should have advised Tom not to believe what Mary said.
I think Tom hasn't left yet.
I already said I'd do that.
Remember, we're all in the same boat.
I wonder if we forgot to tell Tom to do that.
You're a genius.
Tom and Mary think they might have the answer.
I think Tom may have done it.
Tom said he didn't decide what to do.
Tom said he liked the movie.
French isn't my native language.

Everybody, but Tom knew Mary had love with her.

They said they knew I was coming.
I don't want to be here any more than you do.
Is Tom planning to stay home all day?
I know Tom's gonna be quicker than Mary.
I know Tom's a snob.
I don't know I need to do that.
I can't accept this gift.

You can't do that.
Tom will be very sad if that happens.
I wish I was better in French.
Tom says he has some paperwork to be done.
Tom isn't afraid of anyone.
They're not sure they want to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should do that again.
Where's my money?
Tom and Mary said they hoped they could buy what they needed for $300.
I know I'm annoying.
Tom would have been here if he could.

Something happened to her.
I'm often confused with my brother.

Now you're talking about it, I can smell it, too.
You suggest that I'm lying?

You confused the students.
I'm sure Tom's coming to Boston.
It's not safe to drink this water.
I know you don't know how to speak French.
You could have warned me.
Mr. Tatuya's in the field.
I'm almost sure that's not the case.

I thought you were teaching Tom French.
They said they would think about it.
Tom said he knew Mary would be allowed to do that in the near future.
Tom left about 30 minutes ago.
Tom said he was happy Mary could do that.
I'm a high school graduation, so I'm very much able to answer the problems of high schools and so.
I wonder if Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom will do whatever you want.
I know you're not a fool enough to believe that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary and I really could do that.
Tom should have refused to leave early.

I'm so worried about my future.
How could anyone do that to the child?
I know Tom knows we don't need to do that.

That's not exactly the way it happened.

Who did this?
I knew Tom would be curious if you did that.
They said they didn't cry.
You know, Tom is unlikely to do that, don't you?
Tom said he didn't think he had enough time to do this today.
I did everything I was asked to do.
I know someone has to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was the first one to do that.
I know Tom's a little old fascinating.
I know Tom's gonna do that with me.
I wonder if we'll be okay.
I thought it wouldn't be raining today.
Tom and Mary told me that they were depressed.
It's not something that anyone would be ashamed of.
I should have thought about that before.
Do you have anything else you want to know?
Tom said you were happy to do that while you were in Australia.
I'm against death punishment.
What are we doing here?
I forgot to tell Tom I wanted to do that.
I would have written a long letter if I had more time.
I didn't know Tom would care if you did that.
I can't give you a definite answer today.
I don't think Tom could never do that.
I knew Tom was a little under the air.
I think Tom won't go.
Tom may need to do that.
Tom and Mary say they were hungry.
I don't think I had the courage to do that.
They thought they would be busy.
I should have been right.
I know Tom knows I'm not supposed to do that.
I'm sure you're the woman I'm going to marry.
He doesn't have a mobile phone.

Who else knows I'm here?

You know Tom doesn't like that.
They say they're Candy.
I don't think you can do that.
I think Tom can swim away better than Mary.
I'm not gonna let you do that.

I remember it!
I'm bike to work.

Tom tried to do it, but he couldn't.
Tom didn't want anyone to be sad.
Tom said he thought Mary would be disappointed if she did that.
We're finished.
I know Tom missed you.
I don't think Tom could get Mary to do that.
Tom said he would give Mary a book.
Tom said he wasn't happy.
Tom must have forgotten to tell Mary that.
I think Tom's capital.
Someone had to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are both crazy.
I wonder if Tom is pleased.
Tom's house was devoured by fire.
I don't think I'm enjoying this as much as you look like.
You're still planning to do that, don't you?
You should have asked Tom why he did that.
They said they needed our help.
Tom told me that I was beautiful.
The city was freed with snow.
I hope we can get some good ideas.

I wonder if Tom knew Mary didn't do that.
They say they can do that.
Tom and Mary said they were really sure they needed it.
We don't have much to help.
Open the door, please.
Tom said he knew Mary would want to do it by himself.
To all who wonder if America's beacon still burns as light: Tonight, we showed that our people's real strength is not from our arms or the size of our wealth, but from the constant strength of our ideas: democracy, liberation, and the hope of endless hope.
Who told Tom to do that?
I'll stay in Australia as long as I can.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
I think both Tom and Mary want to go to Australia.
Tom said she was hoping she wouldn't do that again.

I suspect Tom and Mary are going to hate this.
Tom said he wanted Mary and I wouldn't get out of the dark.
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
They told me they'd be back soon.
You should have done that without Tom's help.
Somebody's waiting for us in the lobby.
I knew Tom was planning to tell Mary to do that.
I lost three kiloss.
The same thing must have happened to Tom.
I know Tom's almost like I'm.
Tom didn't read everything carefully as he had to.
We know Tom is unlikely to do that.
I knew Tom went to this school.
I'm afraid we'll have to start again.
I'm so sorry that happened.
That's an interesting proposal.
You weren't surprised that I had to do that, was you?
I know this.
I don't think anyone really thought Tom was rich as he said.
He's not old enough to get a driver's license.
His dream has become real.
They promised they would do that tomorrow.
I think both Tom and Mary were born in Australia.
Why do you think Tom would do that?
I can get out if the rain stops.
I don't think Tom enjoys playing.
Tom could have been present at the meeting today, but he didn't want to be, so he wasn't.
Tom and Mary say they will never give up.
It may not be hard to do that as you think it's gonna happen.
Kids, listen!
They say they have no deceit.
Nobody in my family is a musician.
Tom admits he was weak.
Tom said you were able to do that while you were in Boston.
Tom and Mary think they know what to do.
I don't think it's a good idea.
I know Tom's picked up.
The wound hasn't been healed yet.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would do that.
I'm not sure I want to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary was the last thing to do.
I should pay more attention in biology class.
Tom said he was too young to do that.
You're not taking it, are you?
Is there anywhere we can talk about this privately?
I think I can try.
They're not like people.
I don't think I'll be busy next week.
I don't think I'm the person you're looking for.
I'm far away from happiness.
I don't think Tom has any friends in Boston.
Both Tom and Mary complained about John.
I know you're not serious.
Tom said he never heard of me.
Tom said she didn't think she knew how to drive.
I never said that!
Have a great weekend.
I suspect Tom and Mary have already left Australia.
Tom thought it would hurt.
It doesn't matter.
That's really hard.
Tom will be surprised if you don't do that.
Tom knew she was with John.
I promise I'll be back soon.
Tom said she shouldn't stay in the party so long.
They put their boots on.
I thought you came to see Tom.
This should have been done a long time ago.
I don't think it's probably that Tom's going to be over this night.
I don't say a little bit.
Tom said he was supposed to do that tomorrow.
Tom had to do that weeks ago.
Mary said she wasn't planning.
Tom told Mary that she should go home.
I think Tom is still motivated.
I had to go.
I thought Tom was hungry.
Tom thinks he could win the race if he tried a little harder.
Tom's lawyer wasn't surprised when he found him not guilty.
What's the real reason Tom didn't want to buy it?
Tom thought everybody at school knew he was arrested.
It's not something I'm so good.
I thought it was true.
They were so precious books they had been handled with the greatest care.
You shouldn't have declined the invitation.
I didn't know, Tom told Mary that she couldn't do that.
I know Tom is a teacher here.
Tom thought he was forgotten to tell Mary what to do.
Tom told Mary that she thought John wasn't pleased.
I understand nobody wants to help us.
Tom and Mary told me that they thought I should lose some weight.
I know you don't know either.
If you want this pen, I'll give it to you.
I know Tom doesn't know why you didn't do that.
I think it would be hard to do that.
Tom told me that he thought you could do that.
Tom doesn't know that Mary was the one who did that.
I know Tom is a bit more taller than I am.
I don't remember!
I should have been a movie star.
Tom said he hopes you would not go home by yourself.
Tom told me that Mary was used to play a guitar in John's group.
If that was possible, someone would have done it right now.
I think Tom still needs to do that.
Tom said he didn't need your permission to do that.
Tom's eating.
Tom said she was willing to help you.
I know Tom is more beautiful than me.
Tom and Mary said they're glad to help.
Tom knew he would be busy on October 20th.
I think I can do that better than you can.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are worried.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't wait.
Tom said the group's reliable.
I wonder if Tom wanted to sing.
I don't think Tom's realistic.
I know Tom can't play the guitar.
Tom said he didn't think she was asking Mary to do that.
He's a passive-agressive teacher.
Tom said he thought Mary was in Australia.
Tom doubts Mary can fly.
It's not easy for you, is it?
Tom could have been responsible for what happened, but I don't think he was.
Tom knew I was uncomfortable.
Tom told me he'll be back soon.
It's obvious Tom wants to do that.
I think it's a risk that anybody could take.
I'm sorry I forced you to do that.
I thought you would like to do it yourself.
Tom said he thought Mary would be scared.
Tom doesn't want Mary to know how to do that.
Tom refused to do that.
Tom had to tell Mary that she was doing that wrong way.
Call me!
You should have told Tom how you felt.
We'll consider your advice.
It's too bad to eat.
The paint is drying.
Tom might be lost.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is.
Hi, my name is Tom!
Tom said he never wanted to get married.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would do that.
Tom's still dating the same girl three years ago.
You don't get away from me so easy, Tom.
Tom will give us everything we ask for.
Tom and Mary said they were supportive.
You're a drug addict like me!
I think I don't deserve it.
I thought Tom wasn't here.
I'm silent.
Tom was surprised that Mary didn't do that.
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
Thank you for coming.
I'm sure Tom will leave anyway.
Both Tom and Mary will go.
I thought you were asking Tom to do that.
Don't hang up!
I probably sing better than Tom.
Tom's bad.
Didn't you know there was a good chance that would happen?
I wonder if Tom will be at Mary's party tonight.
Tom is the only one in our office who doesn't speak French.
This isn't expensive.
I didn't think I had a chance to do that.
I know that would be hard to do.
Tom must have missed something.
I know someone had to do that.
Tom said he'd hoped he could win.
Tom said she didn't want to do that.
It's not a big deal.
Tom thinks he's love.
Tom doesn't need to do that by himself.
Tom said she had to do that.
Tom didn't know Mary was living in Australia.
I'm wondering if Tom still thinks she should do that.
I'm planning to send Tom a birthday present.
I don't speak French as fluently as you do.
Tom gave me a lot of things.
I know Tom didn't know why you wanted him to do that.
They said they didn't know what to do.
I should have listened to you.
Do you have a hobrella I can borrow?
Tom and Mary said they didn't think.
Feder held his service in love at 2-2.
We should have been studying harder.
Tom said he'd die instead of doing that.
I think I'm gonna have to tell Tom everything.
I know Tom didn't know who to do that.
I wonder if Tom's disgusting.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to do that.
Mary says she's planning to go tomorrow.
I must have misunderstud.
Tom's looking at Mary's birthday cake.
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary to do that.
Tom said he didn't have time to answer all my questions.
Tom said it should be simple.
I don't think Tom knows how hurt Mary was.
I think we're free to go.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I know you're not a fool enough to believe that.
I don't think anyone can do that.
Tom agreed to our children next Sunday.
Tom said he wouldn't win Mary.
Tom said he wasn't sure Mary could take care of herself.
Tom lived in Australia for three years when he was a child.
I'm sure Tom's really plans to do that this week.
Is it true that Tom tried to catch himself?
Who are you calling a fool?
I call my brother.
There's a good chance Tom will do this for us.
I knew Tom wouldn't hurt me.
Tom wasn't honest.
You could just tell me.
Tom just looked like he didn't understand French.
Tom said she was willing to do that for you.
I thought it was interesting.
Tom's sadness.
Tom told me she wouldn't be in Boston next week.
Let me know Tom's planning to stay in Australia for three weeks.
Tom and Mary said they always did it.
I can't!
I don't think Tom knows what Mary will do tonight.
I know Tom knew why you didn't do that.
There's no hot water.
I like such fruit as grapes and peaches.
Tom plans to stay with us when he comes to Boston.
I don't think you should tell Tom what Mary did.
Tom thought about it for a few days.
Tom's working in a store isn't far away from where he lives.
You're very brave.
Tom told me why Mary didn't want to do that.
Forget it.
Tom said more than he should have.
I thought Tom wouldn't like the book Mary gave him.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't do that today.
Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary didn't want to do that.
I hope that things remain peaceable.
I can cut you off with my bare hands.
I thought Tom might be angry with you.
I don't think Tom is Mary's boyfriend.
Tom said he thought he should do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were safe.
Tom thought he heard his name called.
We don't believe that.
This is a song I learned when I was a child.
The way is long.
Tom's a good carpenter.
Tom said she was going to be in Australia next Sunday.
It'll be difficult to do it.
I thought I would try it again.
Tom will be very disappointed if you don't eat the salad he has done.
We're both out of Boston.
I don't think Tom knows I'm Mary's boyfriend.
You lied to her!
I don't know, but I think Tom wants to be a teacher.
I thought it was a thrilling story.
They put their balls down.
Tom and Mary said they were really sure they could do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like to do that.
I must have made a mistake.
Tom told everyone he wanted to do that.
Tom told Mary that she wasn't planning to stay in Boston too long.
I know Tom is a very successful musician.
I didn't think anyone did that.
I didn't want to know I'm going to do that.
Both Tom and I need help.
Are you hungry too?
I'm sure we were in any real danger.
Did you know Tom was going to win?
They say they don't think they're fucking.
The physician said that this was inconvenient.
Tom told me that if I did that, too.
I knew Tom would be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to hurt you.
I don't think Tom will come to school today.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to say.
Is there any chance you can help me get them?
Are you sure that's what you want to do?
I know someone who can do that for you.
I thought I heard a mouse in the mutchen.
I know Tom wouldn't make Mary do that.
Tom put her eyes on.
There is nothing God can do.
Tom said she wasn't impressed by Mary.
I thought it was a lot.
Tom said he thought the economy was in a bad shape.
I was living in Boston when I was hot.
How long was that?
I think Tom is a lover.
I'm buying a new car.
In 1497, John Caabot was exploded in Canada.
Tom and Mary told me they weeped.
I didn't think Tom was happy that happened.
Do you think it would be hard for you to do that?
Tom told me that he likes to do that.
I know you're not like that.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't win.
I didn't think Tom would be fired for doing that.
I planned to do that yesterday.
Tom knew he shouldn't say anything.
Tom and Mary say they'll sing.
There's a park near my house.
I hope I'll get another chance.
You'll know the truth one day.
Tom told me she wouldn't come to school tomorrow.
We found that Tom was a thief.
Tom didn't want to return to Boston.
Mary made her husband a breakfast.
It's not a bedtime yet.
I think Tom might be able to do that.
I must have forgotten it.
You know yourself.
Don't say anything.
I would have done it at that time.
Tom and I are a little busy.
Tom told me he was leaving his wife.
It's probably gonna be hard for Tom to win.
I knew Tom was doing that.
I admit I didn't do what Tom told me to do.
They said they weren't retired.
Tom says he's not planning.
Nobody else has complained.
Tom told me that Mary was very hungry.
Tom and Mary think they understand women.
I didn't know Tom was trans.
They say they're gonna beat you.
I think you should let Tom know you can't speak French.
I knew Tom didn't care about Mary.
I didn't know Tom had a house in Australia.
I can't stand this hot.
Tom and Mary say they don't care.
I'm just as surprised as everyone else.
They thought they were lovely.
I don't think he's doing that.
I didn't know you were planning to do that today.
Why is Tom crazy at Mary?
They say they want something to eat.
Tom will help anyone who asks for help.
I know Tom's a member.
I'm very sure Tom's going to be here.
That book is very old.
No one of us plans to stay here for a long time.
I know Tom's not a digital student.
I thought you were supposed to do that right now.
Maybe Tom doesn't know he's gonna be fired.
Tom wanted to keep walking, but Mary ordered them to stop and rest.
I don't think Tom knows how to dance.
Because it was raining, I didn't go.
Tom knows I'm home.
Four times two are eight.
They said they would do that.
Tom said he was asked to help.
I didn't think Tom would ever talk to me again.
It's not too windy today.
Tom won't be here until 2:30.
Tom is the only one I know who was in Australia.
I promise I won't tell anyone what you did.
They put their swimsuits on.
Hurry up, Tom.
You should have talked more politely.
If you were there, we would have had a good time together.
Tom said he wasn't happy here.
I'm in loss for words.
Tom and Mary said they liked it.
Tom and I are a little busy now.
They said they thought they were manipulated.
I don't think Tom would be moved to do that.
Tom said it wasn't like Mary's good time.
Tom said she wasn't interested in that.
At least you should have told Tom and Mary that they shouldn't have to do that anymore.
I knew Tom wouldn't cry.
I think Tom would like to live in Australia.
I thought I could handle it myself, but I couldn't.
It's not the night yet.
Tom thought everybody knew Mary's going to do that.
I know Tom didn't know why Mary did that.
Tom said he could swim at least Mary.
That's the most crazy movie I've ever seen.
Tom's plans to go soon.
You're not upset, are you?
Tom said she was thinking she was planning to go to Boston with her.
Let's go to the park where it isn't noise.
I think Tom has to do that.
I thought I wouldn't be too long.
Where are you going?
Tom and Mary said they'd be oversighted their visas.
She dreamed a happy dream last night.
Both Tom and Mary are tired.
I thought both Tom and Mary were in suspense.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know what to do.
I have to admit that I'm a little worried.
Tom jumped his hands with the wood that Mary handed him.
I think Tom's record speaks for himself.
You have the same rights as everyone else.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to stay where they were.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom said he wouldn't try it again.
Tom said he couldn't do that until October.
Tom said Mary's sleeping.
Tom said he would never leave early.
I'm sure Tom would be that stupid.
I don't know I can do it.
I don't think Tom would never think of it.
How did you know Tom couldn't do that?
Tom doesn't have good terms with his family.
Tom can see what Mary can't do.
Tom said he was hoping to see how to do that.
Both Tom and Mary were silent for a long time.
I'm starting to remember it.
If I had the money, I would buy this computer immediately.
We're already mounting it.
Tom and Mary said they would do it on time.
I don't think Tom doesn't understand how Mary could speak French.
Tom told everyone that he was happy to happen.
The value of the rice rope is three percent.
They say they were asked for help.
Tom knows he has no choice.
Nobody should have died.
Tom would have done that if he knew how to do it.
I hope Tom knows he doesn't need to do that.
He's crazy.
I would have done this for you if I had more time.
I knew Tom wasn't in Boston.
Tom said he thought it would rain on Monday.
Do you think Tom would like to do that?
Tom told me that she thought Mary would be hesitated to do that.
They said they don't work on Mondays.
I think Tom's waiting for someone.
I know Tom is a few pounds lighter than Mary.
Tom said he likes this work.
I know Tom didn't know who wanted to do that.
Tom said Mary was a mistake.
They told me they needed money.
Tom said she was thinking she was planning to go to Australia with her.
Wait!
I didn't tell Tom I grew up in Australia.
Tom did it in his purpose.
I thought Tom had a party last night.
I know Tom didn't know you needed to do that.
Tom's planning to do that.
Who's the photographer?
I knew Tom was a gun owner, but I didn't know he had so many weapons.
I didn't understand.
I'm lucky, I can still do that.
They put their phones away.
I think Tom would help us if he had been there.
They said they were excited.
They're doctors.
Tom and Mary should keep awake.
Tom and Mary said they didn't plan together.
They said they were stubborn.
Tom could have given me more money.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to drink with us.
I'll watch TV.
I don't think Tom knows when the meeting will start.
Tom and Mary let us know they won't do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much money was thieved.
Tom and Mary are planning to stay in Boston for a few days.
Get off the sparrows.
Tom and Mary said they were lonely.
Tom said we should be patient.
Is Tom used to live in Australia?
As a rule, we have three dinners a day.
Does Tom think I believe that?
I'm playing volleyball now.
They say they can't help.
Nobody knows that Tom didn't do that.
I don't think anyone's doing that.
Tom said she wasn't responsible for what happened.
Tom said he thought Mary was hungry.
I thought Tom was with Mary.
I knew Tom wouldn't want to do that.
It could have happened to anyone.
I know Tom is alone in his apartment.
I'm a woman.
You know you did the right thing.
Tom must go home now.
Tom said she'd be early.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was good.
I know you're not doing that right now.
We already know you did that.
I think Tom would be cooperative.
Tom knows he has to do something, but he doesn't know what.
I'm sorry, Tom thinks that way.
Tom said he hoped he could win the race.
Tom didn't know you were planning to stay.
We're a team.
Do Tom and Mary know they want to leave?
Tom said he thought he could do that by 2:30.
Tom's plans to go too.
Tom doubts Mary can take care of herself.
Tom said he thought Mary was supposed to do that.
I don't think it'll be difficult to convince Tom to do that.
Tom said he could do that.
Tom's happy.
Both Tom and Mary are conservative.
Tom said he thought Mary would not be allowed to do this by himself.
I pray.
Tom told me that Mary was satisfied.
I don't think Tom knows the whole story.
I don't even think Tom saw me.
Put it on your rib.
That's the same for me.
I'm the first musician in my family.
Some people say that true love doesn't exist.
I'm not so good when you get people quickly.
Tom told me I could use his computer.
The first person I met in Australia was Tom.
Everybody, but Tom knew she didn't need to stay in Boston.
Tom and Mary told me they'd look at it.
They know Tom means business.
Tom told me that John would be allowed to do this after her birthday.
I don't think that was the problem.
They told me they felt good.
Tom said she really enjoyed dance with Mary.
Tom said that's not the only reason why Mary wanted to do this.
It's unfortunate.
Tom told me he thought Mary was downstairs.
I know Tom shouldn't do that.
Tom and Mary are planning to take photos tomorrow.
This man is not my husband.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
I'm sure Tom didn't do that.
Tom must have been very tired when he came home.
I'm sure Tom can't speak French.
Tom's no chance to help us.
I don't think you can eat it.
Tom said he'd try to do that.
I thought it was cool.
Tom's working in a store isn't far away from where he lives.
I thought you said you didn't want to talk about it.
I don't know anyone there except Tom.
Tom told me that he was quicker than Mary.
I don't think Tom's still sad.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was fired.
It's not a bad plan.
Did Tom know you're planning to do that?
Tom convinced me that you were the best person for the job.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't do that for her.
That water isn't cold.
I think Tom was staying in Boston the last Sunday.
How could anyone vote to someone like me?
They said they were busy.
I know Tom is in his room to collect his suitcase.
Do you really believe Tom can reassure you to buy that?
I don't think nobody saw us like that.
Tom told you to speak French.
I had to go to the Dentist last week.
They told me they were shy.
I don't think Tom's adopted.
I swear I'm not high.
Tom and Mary gave me their old car.
Tom said she hadn't seen Mary for a long time.
Both Tom and I know you did that.
Tom told me I was broken.
I know both Tom and Mary are both sick.
I can't understand why anyone wants to do that.
Tom said he was interested in learning how to do that.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary what to do.
They still hope they can do that.
Tom said he was out of the way.
"Are anyone with you?" "No, I was alone."
I know you're not.
Tom told everyone that he wasn't reluctant to do that.
This box is so hard!
I thought you said you wanted to go to Boston.
I met someone who knew Tom yesterday.
I know you can't get away with this.
Every time someone knocks on the door, my dog starts swinging.
Both Tom and Mary have the same problem.
There's no way you can do that for yourself.
I'm afraid something's wrong with Tom.
The bill was hard to calculate.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I never met anyone like you before.
It would have been hard to do that.
Tom may be ready to do that.
Tom will try to help Mary do that.
It could have been worse.
Tom thinks that wouldn't be a good idea.
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Tom and I didn't go to the meeting yesterday.
How did you come to the party?
Do you think Tom's already retired?
I wonder if Tom still remembers how to do that.
Didn't you know Tom was used to live Boston?
I don't think it's gonna rain, but I'll take a hobbrella in the case.
Tom promised him to tell us.
Tom said he didn't have to be hurry.
Both Tom and I are still high school students.
You're making a big mistake.
Tom says he saw a honey.
Tom thinks Mary will not be lonely.
Tom and Mary said they would help.
Did you have the umbrella belonging to Tom?
Tom should have done much better.
I know Tom's almost home on Monday.
I think Tom really hates you.
I know Tom would like to do it by himself.
Tom said he'd be retiring next October.
I didn't know Tom was playing the trumpet.
You think it'll rain this weekend?
I know Tom probably did not do what he was supposed to do.
I don't remember asking you to do that.
There's no way I'm gonna let you do that.
Tom told everyone he was lonely.
I wonder if Tom is still busy.
What's the name of our CEO?
I know you're worried about Tom.
I thought I was very good.
Tom admits he was troubled.
Nobody could hear what Tom said.
Tom said she was going to visit Mary in Australia next Sunday.
They're queens.
Not everyone's ready.
There's going to be a storm.
Tom must have been skeptical.
Where's the meeting going to be held?
I think Tom is wrong.
Tom said she thought John wouldn't want to do that.
I thought it would be easy to do that.
Tom says she hopes Mary knows she has to do that.
It's not cold today as it was yesterday.
It's not a game for kids.
I hope you'll wait for us.
Tom said she was hoping Mary's here today.
Tom said Mary was worried.
Tom and Mary said they enjoy teaching French.
Tom said he was really happy Mary.
I wonder if Tom found anything.
I'm from South America.
I'd do that in another way.
I don't think Tom will come or not.
I'm sure Tom had the courage to do that.
Tom doesn't want to go to his company's Christmas this year.
You're just a student.
Tom said he would never let Mary do that.
Why do you think Tom likes so much baseball?
I'll telephone you later.
Many people believe that this will not happen.
Tom knows he shouldn't have to eat peanuts.
Tom told me he was going to try again.
I wish you had told me before.
Tom said she trusted Mary.
Tom thought he wouldn't have to do that anymore.
Tom told me that Mary was going through the time we got there.
I don't think Tom would let Mary do this on her own.
Don't study.
I thought you were still in Australia.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was unhappy.
I don't know that both Tom and Mary want to go there.
I don't think it'll be too long for you.
I think Tom wants me to go with Mary.
I know you want to help.
Tom and I stood up at the same time.
They said they didn't have to be hurry.
I know you have something more important to think about.
I'm not deaf.
I didn't read all the books.
Tom shouldn't have been out.
Do you know Tom's not planning to attend today's meeting?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she was fired.
Tom said Mary's gonna have to do that unlikely.
That's the kind of music I like to listen.
She choked herself a jumper.
I know Tom was used to be good at that.
Tom wasn't the one who told Mary not to do that.
I knew Tom was afraid that the police could arrested him.
I doubt Tom didn't visit Australia.
I thought it would take a month.
They thought they could do it for me.
It's been years since we met.
I know Tom could be finished by 2:30.
I didn't have enough money to buy a present.
Tom must have seen something.
I thought you said we wouldn't be here.
They say they're not afraid to do that.
Mary became pregnant when she was 14.
I think Tom needs to go.
I have a lot of work to do.
I don't think I'm too drunk for this.
They told me they loved me.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that for John.
I know Tom's done this.
They say they have to do that.

It shouldn't be fun.
They said they were uncovered.
Tom hasn't yet told us what to do.
I know you don't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
Only if you had helped me last night, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said she was expecting Mary to go back to Boston on October 20.
Tom said he thought he was supposed to do that again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they weren't swiming.
I knew that Tom told Mary that she couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they're ignored.
If Tom left at 2:30, he would have been here now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
No doubt Tom was used to live in Australia.
Tom decided to stay in Australia for three days.
Tom said he thought I was unreasonable.
I should have stayed and help Tom.
Tom said he thought I could do that.
I thought Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimer here.
I wonder if it'll be snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom is pleased.
I'm flying fish.
The wind was calmed at night.
Tom said that it might be dangerous.
Slow down.
Tom would have done it right now if he was really planning to do it.
I know Tom could do that if he really needed it.
We'll never know.
Tom admits that she killed Mary.
Didn't you know your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom will never hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very quickly.
You're not going to be troubled for helping me, are you?
I heard the women spend more shoes than men.
I think Tom's gonna be excited.
We'll be in 15 minutes.
Tom said she would take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do.
I thought you were going to fix it.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told that he wouldn't be allowed to do that.
They say they're uncertain.
I know Tom didn't know he couldn't do that.
Tom had to tell me before.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that.
They say they need to do that.
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they would help me.
I don't think I'd never be able to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they're stuck.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everybody knew Tom could speak well of French.
Tom said he'd find something.
It's not a contribution.
Tom said he never thought Mary was in Australia.
I don't think Tom's looking like John.
Tom said he thought the prices in that store were too high.
I don't think anyone's arguing about that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he'd hoped that he could do this today.
You knew everyone in the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unresponsive.
I'm sorry that happened.
I know Tom isn't afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that without help.
It's hot.
Tom told me she didn't want to live in Boston.
Nobody asked me whether I like it.
Many old people today can't be able to stay with these times.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he was going to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom probably thought Mary wouldn't do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom refused that he accepted the bribe.
Tom said that this wouldn't be a good idea.
I'm sure I didn't do what Tom told me to do.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was unhappy.
Can't it wait until morning?
We'll be moving in 15 minutes.
We know that will not happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom's uncovered.
I'm afraid I lost it.
Tom said she'd probably be disappointed.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they were.
I know Tom had to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do this today.
Don't talk about business when we eat.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was hard.
I hope Tom's adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She's gonna be taken to hospital.
I would have helped you if you asked him.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
It's not a drill.
Tom had to do that a long time ago.
I think Tom woke up all the morning.
I wonder if Tom's upset.
Tom said he knew they couldn't let him go at school.
Tom said she's hoping Mary likes to do that.
Tom would have done this for Mary if she had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something is not right yet.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked rices.
I know Tom's not planning to go to Boston with you.
Tom said he wasn't sure Mary had to do that.
I didn't think Tom could talk to Mary to do that.
Are Tom and Mary planning to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought this would be fun.
I think you'll find that it's Tom's fault.
I thought it was privacy.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are gonna do that?
What do you think they were Tom and Mary?
Are you still planning to do this with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
Her young sister is a famous TV star.
I know when you said you were there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're murmuring.
You and me know that's not true.
Let's think that's happening.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone to trust him.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that she thought she was truthful.
It's probably Tom's coming.
I'm sure Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think nobody had tried this before.
You should have used your time better.
They say they're not planning.
Tom said that it seemed like Mary was really hard to do that.
I'm learning old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could do that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was hard to get together.
They said they were too drunk.
You could have told me before.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was out.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptics.
I know Tom doesn't do that anymore.
Tom says he's just sworn when it's necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said that he shouldn't say.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me that this book was interesting.
Tom thought everybody knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he was planning to go on October 20.

Tom thought everybody at school knew he was arrested.
Tom wanted to know how to make Mary happy.
Tom said she saw Mary doing that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.

I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it could be dangerous.

Tom was just looking at the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he could do that in a few hours.
No doubt you can pass the examination.
Where's everyone?
How do you feel?
Fortune favors the brave.
They don't know they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still looking at me.
I thought Tom heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope nobody comes.
What color was Tom dressing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that if they could find anyone else for them.
Tom said she'd go home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should have sold someone more qualified.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was gunned.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overgrown.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me that he was too tired to study.
Where's your gangge?
Both of my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that is not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said that Mary was able to help her to do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's cubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom will be willing to talk to me.
Tom said she could win Mary.
I didn't think you could get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, little German.
Tom thought a bad thing would happen.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I know it's unlike anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I'm sure Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I enjoy playing volleyball.
It's probablyn't gonna admit Tom's wrong.
Tom said he couldn't win.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that soon.
There's a possibility Tom wouldn't want to go with us to Boston.
It's not enough to know only one language.
He's a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he wasn't mad.
Tom may have done the same thing Mary did.
I know Tom is a sophomore.

Tom never tried to do that by himself.
How's your father?
My son isn't a snob.
I would have let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was harder than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
Nobody was suspicious of it.
Tom said she didn't think she wanted to do that alone.
I wonder if it's really hot tomorrow.
Is that the first time you've experienced this pain?

They swore that they wouldn't do that again.
I don't really plan to do that.
I know Tom's gonna let you do that.
Tom said Mary would do that.
They said they wouldn't do that.

Don't kick the small stuff.
I don't think nobody can help me now.

Are you sure that's gonna work?
I'm afraid I'm gonna be tied up all night.
I know you can hear me.
You seem to be unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary that she thought she was wrong, but she didn't care what she thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's the first time infection.

Maybe it would be better if I hadn't done it.
I'm sure Tom's gonna have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not busy now as I was this last year.
I would just talk to Tom rather than ignore him.
I thought you would meet my family.
I don't think Tom would be disobedient.
Tom said he was going to do that every day after he was retired.
I don't have much to help, I'm afraid.
Both Tom and Mary are not yet married.
I know Tom knew she couldn't do that.
We're at school together.
I want you to look at these documents.
Tom's tired.
Tom said he didn't need a lawyer.
Tom and Mary said they'd be on train.
I didn't know that Tom didn't really want to do it.
Tom said he was going to ask Mary to leave.
Tom and Mary are going out to walk after lunch.
I know Tom is grouchy.
Tom's gone.
It would be hard to do that.
Tom said he didn't know anything about Mary.
I thought Tom lived in Australia.
I'm so surprised Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom doesn't think you can do that.
Tom said he was arrested.
I don't think Tom is available.
I don't think Tom's doing that.
I wonder if Tom's interested.
I don't think Tom like the song you wrote about him.
I think I'll take this tie.
Tom thought he wouldn't have to do it by himself.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary never did that before.
Tom gave me all the money I asked for.
Tom said she knew that John might want to do that.
The wood was broken with water.
I don't think Tom understand.
They said they were handsome.
Tom can do that, but Mary can't.
I don't think it's a problem anymore.
Tom told me that he thinks he'll do that tomorrow.
I thought it would be clear in the afternoon.
Tom told me that Mary would be finished by 2:30.
I'm an insomniac.
Tom said she would ask Mary if she wanted to do that.
I know that doesn't matter.
Tom says Mary is trustworthy.
Tom and Mary told me they enjoyed the picnic.
I know I shouldn't do that, but I did it anyway.
I think Tom is the one who painted this fence.
Tom must have thought Mary could speak French.
He's a very loving father.
How did Tom know Mary would do that?
Tom told me she was in a lot of trouble.
Tom thinks it will rain tomorrow.
I didn't know Tom had a weapon.
I thought Tom had a good chance to do that.
I didn't think Tom would want your old bicycle.
I wonder if Tom knows who left this package on my chask.
Tom should have found guilty.
It's not working yet.
Tom told me that she thought Mary would be angry.
You're not really planning to help Tom, are you?
Tom, it doesn't have to apologize.
I'm late.
Tom knows he has a problem.
I became a doctor so I could help people.
You can't buy happiness.
You promised you would do that.
Tom said she thought she would be away.
It's not gonna be hard as you think it's gonna happen.
Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't like him.
You over 18?
Tom won't leave his children here with us.
Tom didn't know we wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought you would do that.
Tom said she thought she was supposed to do that next time she went.
Tom said he did it for Mary.
Tom said he doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
Tom said Mary wasn't sure if John wanted to do it.
I thought things would be better.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't quick to do that from me.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
Tom said she thought she wasn't like Mary.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was out.
The way you plan to do this is dangerous.
You should have come soon.
I think Tom is strong.
Tom and Mary didn't know they were supposed to be here yesterday.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be there.
Tom said he was really happy to move to Australia.
I know Tom is a forest range.
It'll be hard for Tom to do that.
They said they were just talking to you.
French is his mother language.
I don't think Tom should do that alone.
Tom took his bag and left.
I'm not the only one who is not married here.
Tom said he knew he wouldn't have to do that again.
They know they should do that today.
You should have been a lawyer.
I'm sure Tom doesn't know I'm here.
I don't think I need to wear a tie to the party.
I don't think Tom has any reason to do that.
Tom said she'd be still a little disorder.
I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
I know Tom hadn't even asked Mary to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was trade.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
I'm afraid Tom might not do what he's supposed to do.
Tom said she didn't want to go to the concert.
Tom told me she was going to drive Mary to the airport.
Tom said he's driveing to Boston on Monday.
They told me they were sleeping.
I know you and Tom will do this together.
I think that's the first time Tom did it.
Tom hoped he would not be punished.
I know Tom is a very rich man.
Tom must have been home at that time.
I don't think I'd like to be here.
There's no hope.
Tom could have left with you if you let him know you're going.
I don't think why Tom did that, even though Mary asked her to do it.
Tom told me that she was still interested in Mary.
Are you good at the maps?
Tom says Mary is a lot.
I'm sure Tom will never do that.
I think Tom's probably a good lawyer.
I thought I could do it without help.
You're getting my leg.
I thought you would never try to do that by yourself.
I don't think we'll do it by ourselves.
I know Tom's the last one to do that.
Tom said he would give Mary a book.
I know Tom didn't know why I was planning to do that.
Tom didn't know I was Mary's cousin.
They said they didn't know any French.
I thought you could quit.
I didn't know how Tom was planning to tell Mary not to do that.
I thought you wanted to be a dancer.
I don't think I'd be very good company.
Tom says the party is over.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom said I wouldn't want to do it by myself.
The security isn't guaranteed.
Tom didn't offer to help.
I think Tom's gonna be right.
I thought Tom told you I'd be here.
You know I'm gonna be arrested?
He's a disgusting human being.
Tom's already wanting to do that.
Take off your school uniform.
I'm sure Tom's gonna have to help Mary do that.
I'm afraid I can't.
I know Tom's almost like you.
The first time I met Tom, he was only ten years old.
Tom says he's his favorite country in Australia.
I doubt Tom never did that.
I thought we could get out.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a child?
I'd like to stay longer.
Tom plans to do that today.
You're the same age as I am.
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try to do it.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Tom said he wanted to give Mary flowers.
They said they had alibis.
Tom was able to do what he needed.
I knew you wouldn't like Australia.
I couldn't think of anything.
I wish you never told me.
Tom won't know I'm here.
I don't think you're a driver as good as you say.
Tom said she didn't think she had to do that.
They told me they were lonely.
What's the time now?
Tom said things were good.
Tom told everyone he didn't know how to speak French.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary learned to do that.
I'm sure we can prove that.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
Tom was surprised that no one was there.
I'm not surprised Tom doesn't have to do that.
He's not very good at the politics game.
Tom thought it was funny to put a egg on Mary's chair.
They said they didn't feel hot.
That's the first time I was eating in Italian pizzeria.
Tom said he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow morning.
Tom says he doesn't want to do that.
I thought you said nobody would be here.
Tom thinks Mary's hungry.
I'm skind.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Tom's drinking less than Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary wanted to do that.
One can't do a lot of things at the same time.
I can't remember her name.
The father works.
Tom and Mary say they're not afraid.
I'll save you a piece of a piece.
I thought I was gonna be asked to give a talk.
It's a privilege to meet you.
Tom was surprised when Mary told him that she had to do that.
Tom said he thought you could help us today.
I was used to stay late.
I thought Tom looked happy.
Tom said she should do that somewhere else.
Nobody seemed to want to do that.
Tom said he knew he would not have to do it by himself.
Nobody told you about the meeting, did they?
I know this is Monday.
Tom says he needs to find someone for him.
I think Tom was supposed to be here right now.
I know Tom and Mary are divorced.
Tom must have seen us.
I know Tom doesn't know he's gonna do that here.
I know Tom's gonna do that in Australia last month.
Tom has no reason to do that.
Mary told me she thought Tom was beautiful.
I didn't know you would be jealous.
I think both Tom and Mary want something to eat.
They said they didn't think of it.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Tom said I was the one to tell Mary that she shouldn't do this here.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I knew Tom should do that out.
I wonder if I should do that.
I'm sure Tom and Mary know something happening.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was retired.
What's your last name?
Tom told me that she thought Mary left.
Tom said she didn't think she had to do that.
I know Tom's going to know that Mary's doing that is too short.
You're brave than me.
Tom said he was drowsy.
They said they tried to do that once.
Tom said he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks.
I should have told Tom not to believe what Mary said.
It would have been interesting to do that.
If you had told me before, I would have dressed.
I think Tom's scared.
Tom said she's sure Mary can fly.
What's his problem?
I think Tom's focusing.
I'm not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
Why are everybody looking at me?
Tom has everything he needs.
They view foreigners with suspicious; I see everyone with suspicion.
I don't think I can do that better than you.
You could have let me know you'll be late.
Tom's crazy.
The desire to correct matters is a sign of wisdom.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think nobody wants to do that today.
It's not as humily today as it was yesterday.
If I knew how to do it, I would have done it myself.
Tom rebuked his bicycle.
You're not really planning to get photographs, are you?
He's two years older than me.
Tom and Mary told me that they were disappointed.
I didn't know Tom had to do that anymore.
I thought you told people you're doing that.
It's obvious Tom's waiting for someone.
He doesn't watch TV.
Tom said he wasn't a reluctant to do that for us.
Give it back!
Tom said he thought Mary could help us today.
I thought the concert went well.
I can't eat at all.
I thought Tom knew what to do.
I'm afraid your plan will not work.
I don't think nobody saw us like that.
Tom said she could win Mary.
I wonder if Tom had another one.
Unless Tom seemed fun.
Tom said he needed money so he could buy something to eat.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary did that.
I knew Tom was finished.
I don't know that's possible.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me.
I thought Tom was still at school.
I knew Tom would be the next one to do that.
They'll be glad they didn't do that.
They say they'll buy it for you.
They say they don't need money.
Tom doesn't want to go by himself.
I know Tom didn't have to do that with us.
Everybody agrees that it was the right decision.
Tom got out of the bath and put his clothes down.
I don't think Tom's planning to help us.
They say they feel better now.
I think you're going to dance with Tom.
Tom thought I would have to do it by myself.
I don't think that's anybody I know.
I don't think Tom did what you said.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
I don't think Tom will be hard to do that.
Tom said she didn't know where Mary wanted to go.
Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children.
Tom really thought we didn't have to do that.
It's not good for anyone.
Tom said he's often thinking about leaving.
Do Tom and Mary know you don't like them?
I know I'm so stupid.
Tom and Mary are both full-time students.
I know that Tom and only Tom need to do that.
Tom said she doesn't think she had to do this today.
I suspect Tom and Mary don't like me so much.
I wonder if I can do that.
Tom really thought we wanted to do that.
I wish I could visit Australia.
She's eating.
He's my love for my life.
I think Tom is a good painter.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing for dinner.
It wasn't hard to find a pair of shoes like that.
I wouldn't have allowed Tom to do that.
I promised Tom to go to Australia with him.
Tom sings better than me.
Tom said he had a difficult day.
You feel like swimminging?
Tom and Mary hope they still can win.
Tom knows we can't win.
I don't think I can do that.
You're gonna be blamed.
I thought you said your car was thieved.
I didn't know Tom would be quicker than Mary.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children.
If Tom doesn't do that, I'm not both.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was funny.
I know Tom didn't know Mary should do that.
I wonder if Tom was really staying in Boston the last summer.
Tom knew he would never return in his heart.
We're not ready to go home yet.
Tom should have eaten more.
I thought Tom was going to give Mary flowers.
Tom said that Mary thought John was supposed to do this in the near future.
I didn't think we had enough food to feed everyone.
I should have listened to what my mother said.
Tom's wasting time.
I think Tom was exaggerating.
I was convinced I shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary is still disturbing.
If this is crazy, there's a method in it.
Tom told me everything I needed to know.
They told everyone that they were upset.
Tom said he wouldn't do that unless I help him.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was sincere.
She knows about things like that.
I don't think I never heard about Mary's dinner.
I'm sure Tom and Mary are ready to do that.
What's the name of your pharmacy?
I don't think anyone else wants to come.
I knew Tom was very busy.
Tom said he thought I wouldn't have to do that until October.
What's worried about you, Tom?
Tom is a traffic salesman.
I'm sure Tom isn't at Boston anymore.
Tom believes he needs to do that.
That's the first time I visited Australia.
I knew Tom didn't know that he didn't really have to do that.
Everybody knows we've killed Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't go to Australia with us.
The dinner isn't ready yet.
I hope I can help you tomorrow.
Of course we can do that, but it would be really hard to do it.
I could have saved Tom's life.
There's a good chance Tom will ask Mary to dance.
Tom told me that he found an interesting book about Australia in the local library.
I don't think we can take care of ourselves.
Do you need a lift?
I thought I made my reasons clear.
Tom is someone I'm looking at.
Tom says she's sorry she broke her promise.
I think I just have enough money to buy the computer I want.
I know Tom's gonna try to do that.
I'm so glad to see you.
They said they were cold.
I know Tom knows I don't have to do that.
Tom just did what he had to do last week.
Tom says he doesn't usually wear under under.
I know Tom is a better musician than Mary.

I thought Tom would be happy about it.
I know Tom would let you do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't sleeping.
Tom's going to Boston every chance she gets.
I know Tom never did that.
Didn't you know I was hoping Tom would do that?
They said they'd call you later.
I promise we'll listen to everything you say.
I think you'll enjoy it there.
It's not all that crazy.
I wonder if we have to do that.
Tom told me that he couldn't do that today.
The fuse has blown.
Tom and Mary weren't able to help me.
Tom should have been interested.
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do that today.
It's not good to scoff people in public.
We should have planned for this.
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you didn't do that.
They say they never did it.
Tom and Mary said they won't do that.
I know Tom's connected.
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's get married.
Get the fuck out of here!
I think Tom had at least one time to Boston.
He leaves to Tokyo tomorrow.
I wasn't as helpful as I should.
Tom said she was living in Australia.
They told me they didn't like to study in the morning.
You tricked me!
We're too busy for this, Tom.
Is this a place free?
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
You're free to go.
I know Tom's sure.
Tom thinks it's good.
Tom said he and Mary had a fight this morning.
Tom may be lying.
I heard Tom lives in Australia.
Nobody told me I shouldn't have parked there.
Tom could have taken the money.
Tom doubted Mary would keep her promise.
Don't make sure nobody enters.
I'm sure that's going to change.
Tom told everyone that he was broken.
It was clear that Tom would do that with Mary.
I suspect Tom is drunk.
I met someone who knew we were.
Tom told me he didn't have insurance.
I hope I can live here with you.
Those aged elements were taken to the most bloc for the discussion.
Tom said he felt good about it.
I'm sure Tom and Mary know something interesting is about to happen.
You know I need to do that, don't you?
They must have known who I was.
I don't think I passed the test.
I knew Tom was a bad loss.
I don't think Tom's dead.
They said they didn't feel anything.
I knew Tom would like Mary.
I don't think Tom would be afraid if you did it with him.
Tom said he thought he couldn't win.
My America's impression is very good.
I don't like anyone who I'm working.
They stayed friends.
Tom told me that Mary was going to be back soon.
Tom said she didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said she thought Mary was fun.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't like so much, John.
I don't think Tom can do it without help.
It's not hard to do that.
I'm so sorry I'm kissed Tom.
I'm scared.
Tom told me he was very hungry when he came home.
Tom said she wouldn't know how to do that.
I don't think Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning to do that.
Tom said he heard three shoes.
I think you're shit-up.
Didn't you know Tom had a dog?
I knew Tom wouldn't want to stop doing that.
Tom and Mary told me that they were lying.
Tom's a horrible, just like John.
I'm sure Tom's going to happen.
I'm a friend of Tom.
I thought Tom would forget me now.
They say they're working very hard.
I don't think Tom doesn't know if Mary likes him.
I don't think I can move to Boston the next year.
The only person who could do this is Tom.
They told me they were good.
I thought I wouldn't have to see you again.
I'm decorating the classroom.
I know Tom knew she wanted to do that.
Tom and Mary said they were depressed.
Tom knows I don't like him.
I know Tom doesn't know I have to do that.
Tom said I should have left before.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could do it by himself.
Tom said he had forgotten the door.
It's hard to do that, right?
What I got from Tom was the best.
I don't think I have enough money.
Tom wasn't given the opportunity to give you and I were given.
How did you know Tom was planning that?
Will you give me a pen?
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
I have a feeling that I had been here before.
Tom was insulted to everyone.
Tom says Mary is still alive.
What's the stupid thing you ever did?

Any possibility Tom's gonna do this with us?

I don't like you.
Tom said he thought Mary would be hungry.

I didn't know you were planning to do that while you were in Australia.
I don't think Tom rides his motorcycle anymore.
Tom said he doesn't feel like that.
I know Tom doesn't know why I did that on Monday.
Tom evidently had to do that.
I don't think Tom knows he's never able to do that.
I can't put up with the voice anymore.
I know Tom didn't know we can't do that.
I hope you already know what to do.
Didn't I tell you I wouldn't go to Australia?
Tom said he thought it would be better if we didn't do that here.
Tom said he didn't want to leave.
Tom told me that she thought Mary would be home.
You're a better chess player than me.
Tom said he liked the idea.
I'm going to watch TV tonight.
I think Tom is a few months older than Mary.
I think you know Tom already.
I should have kissed Tom.
I know Tom knows why I should do that.
I'm sorry I opened your mail by mistake.
Tom thought Mary wasn't done that yet.
I wonder if Tom could do that.
If I'd take that plane, I wouldn't be alive now.
I don't think Tom would enjoy this movie.
I'm sure your intentions are honorable.
I know Tom is about the same weight as I am.
Tom said he didn't know why the meeting was postponed.
You should have taken his advice.
They say they like that.
I know someone needs to do that.
Tom told me she wasn't afraid to do that.
I hope Tom's not tired.
They said they were conscientious.
I don't think I'll be scared.
I know Tom can't really do that even if he says he can.
We could do it by ourselves.
I thought you might have a idea.
Tom and Mary said they were disheartened.
I wonder if Tom really is home.
I know Tom knows I'm not supposed to do that.
Both Tom and I haven't done that yet.
Don't pick your nose.
I have to do something with these radiates.
Tom was a criminal and was driven.
I didn't know you needed to do that.
Tom says he's planning to stay in Australia as long as he can.
I don't think there's any way I can help you.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't forgive him.
I don't think I can help you.
I know Tom is a kind of man who would do that.
I doubt Tom will help Mary do that.
Tom said she didn't know how to do that.
I won't tell anyone you're in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to do that alone.
Tom said Mary wasn't too worried.
Tom can swim more faster than Mary.
Tom would have done that for the first time if you helped him.
I'm smoking a cold weather.
I think Tom hurt his leg.
I know Tom didn't know he should do that.
The current political situation is not too stable.

Tom's contract expirs on October 20th.
I don't think Tom would be nervous.
I know Tom is a Red Cross volunteer.
I knew Tom wouldn't do what we asked him to do.
They told me they were ready to do that.
I don't think Tom really did it.
How did you know Tom would be in Australia every week?
I thought Tom wasn't surprised.
I thought you said we're not going to sing.
They said they'd do that soon.
I know the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
I can't believe you want to do that.
I have the impression that Tom's doing good.
Tom didn't know she was John's girlfriend.
They said they were very sick.
I know Tom did that once.
Tom's waiting.
I think both Tom and Mary never did that.
I knew I should have studied French.
Tom said you're stubborn.
Maybe the next time!
I think Tom is lying.
I know Tom knows I shouldn't do that.
I thought you could be in Australia this week.
I'm sorry I waited for you so long today.
Tom thinks Mary's glad that's going to happen.
It's not until you get sick until you realize the value of good health.
I thought I would broke my leg, but a X-ray showed that I wasn't.
Tom said he didn't know Mary did that.
We don't have much to help.
I don't think Tom understand what we want to do.
I don't know what it is.
I wonder if Tom knew I had to do that.
I'm sure the police are going to arrest Tom.
I've lived here forty years.
Tom told me that he hated it.
Tom said he thought I was dead.
Tom said I don't need to do that.
They told me they would do that for us.
Tom told me that Mary knew that John would be allowed to do that.
I'm not proud of my behavior.
Tom said you didn't have permission to do that.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to talk.
I don't think Tom likes your song.
I would have done that if I could.
They said they wouldn't try to do that.
I don't think Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to do that.
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom told me that Mary would be cooperative.
Something's wrong here.
I didn't know Tom was living in the Dormitory.
I thought you would like to see this.
Tom told me he wasn't planning to join the team.
I hope Tom's glad that's going to happen.
They told me they would probably do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were free.
Tom probably said Mary would go to Australia with him.
Tom wouldn't have done that even if he wanted to.
Oh, Boston isn't like Chicago.
I really had to tell Tom not to go to Boston.
I think my neighbour may have died.
I don't think Tom did that yet.
I don't think Tom would be late unless he had a very good reason.
Tom's eating.
Tom said he thought Mary would be cold.
Tom said he thought we could win.
I don't trust governments.
I didn't think there was anyone I knew in Australia.
Do you think I should go to Australia with Tom?
I think Tom should stay here with us.
I don't think Tom will be a problem anymore.
Didn't you know Tom was Mary's brother?
I don't think I don't know that guy.
Tom said he was planning to go on Monday.
I'm afraid I might be late.
I put my helmet on it.
Tom was afraid that his parents would start asking him questions, and he would end up telling them everything.
I knew Tom could do that if he really needed it.
Tom thinks you're going to be here tomorrow.
Everybody knows Tom is lying.
Tom must have seen it.
Tom may be a treacher.
I knew Tom wouldn't agree.
They must have come home by this time.
Tom told me she's gonna talk to Mary about that.
I thought you wouldn't tell anyone.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's shoes is.
He'll do that if nobody stops him.
Put your weapons down!
He's my first love.
In the summer, eggs soon go bad.
I taught my dog to sit and cry.
