Norveç's cancer: Is this the most lucky fish in the world?
Five million people of Norveç enjoy the highest standards of life, not only in Europe but in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the local business collaboration of some of the occult fish?
Take a time for a past peece.
Put them in the middle of the stupid stuff.
Leave it a week.
Now one of the big Norveç tales, you have a rakic smell.
I'm in little Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There's a snow, a great manzara, and this smell is always the base of the air.
Rakfisk is freed, and it's a fierce, depending on how sweet fish you love.
When the dark and the air is cold, Norways are gathered here for a festival of the most fascinating food.
The local local team of the Festival organizer, and the word "Rakfisk General," says Haard Halvarsen, "You'll eat this little, and then you'll swallow a cakewater."
People are eating the small fish crops around us and put a lot of drink.
Award says, "Some people like aquait more than rakusk."
He can kill the drinking smell.
I'm calling a few pieces.
If you can avoid taking the under of your bus, it's not bad, it's unthinkable from a suspitable bus after a long bus trip.
Before Rakfisk Norveç's buzdoch, it's a very different product of water and salt times in the waters and salt.
Then, when it's deeper in the winter, it's been taken out, and it's sure it's bleeding with alcohol.
Just one generation was forced to leave his country to search for thousands of Norways, mostly moved to the United States.
Now the people are rapidly expanding -- more than 13% of the work, the high payment, and the widely care system.
The people are going to go for work from Sweden, who's more richer than Norway in recent times.
Rakfisk represents something important, even though Norveç's history is a part of his life.
It's among the most expensive foods you can buy.
But everything's worth, you give a little little bargain or a sandviç $9 (14).
Norway doesn't always come to the global news -- and many people like that.
The people here still don't want to talk about the name of Anders Breivic, who killed 77 men, women, and kids with weapons.
Rather, it's called "22 July..." to kill.
The Norways are hard to believe that in the peaceful lands of peace, one of them is able to do such an act of violence and murder.
From the beginning of 1970 ’ s, the world has been grown up by one of the biggest pitrols and mines.
Our nervous Anna Nordik's imagination says when he distributes the long-shadow hair and the blue rays that come with the time of the blue. "Ama's not the only reason we're doing so well."
How could we say that we are a modest people?
English, as most people here are, perfect.
We're not so shower, we don't like champagne.
Norvegian pitrol wealth was very careful, unless a small percent of the curricular money from the end, all of them are transmitted to a special population for the future generation.
During the years that nobody else had no money, he had a lot of curtains of Norveç's crafts.
Anna says, "We're happy as long as we can make the winter skirts and walk on the mountain."
He adds, "Ve ratsk seven."
I stand in the snow and I'm waiting for some food at the right time. I'm eating enough rakes.
Now there's a handwritten guest, of course there's a different thing and a better taste.
But there's a lot of more smelling fish tonight.
One of the number of guests that I have been staying in the hotel is the best of the guests here, and maybe they're going to play the fish.
There's a living television on a random random stairs.
It's like the Euroviction's racing.
"How much do you have for the best fish on the mountains? Thor-Juergen?"
"We're here, We're right here."
They've got some coffee.
A man falls from his chair, maybe the aquavait.
Or maybe the smell of all these fishs.
Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexican.
As the new president of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, he looks at the challenges that Will Grant experiences and his people expect.
Mexican traffic is especially bad now.
In the best time, a rival city, it has caused a traffic people in the capital of the capital capital.
But the purpose was not to prevent people from going to work, but it was to prevent protesters from reaching the clinic.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto will take the president of Mexico, and he will take the mission of the nation.
He's going to meet a hard task.
In the reign of Felipe Calderon, he had a fine economy performance in Mexico, but it was under the control of a drug war that led to 60,000 deaths in six years.
Mr. Pena Nieto said to the Oval Officie Barack Obama that the Government has a big word to reduce violence.
I'm going to offer a new security strategy that will lead us to this purpose.
Before Ms. Pena Nieto's previous political experiences were in his state of Mexico.
The crowd around the capital capital is divided by the ideas about new leader in this growing country.
An open dictionary man
For example, in the van Valle del Bravo, he has been remembered lovingly.
Those who live here are honored that he's performing the tourum and creating the golden statistics.
You can go through the new cars of Mr. Pena Nieto's new cars, and I'm going to make a big progress on the traffic paths that were changed.
And the plakets that bear the name are also the only thing to do with the modern sperm climate and the impressive change of climate.
"We're looking at him to bring real and lasting changes to Mr. Pena Nieto's friend and the politician PRI party, Gabriel Olvera.
Especially for security and economy, we hope a very interesting and real change in our country.
After 81 years of unfailing power, PRI was ripped by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Olvera, a member of the conventioner, admits that after 12 years, the participant in the participation Enrique Pena Nieto had a lot of expectation.
And he refuses to call the new president himself independent.
A man with an open word, names himself with a wonderful country violation.
He's a great government and a man who knows more than all.
But that's not what many people have on the other side of the district of the country.
Ciudad, known as Nezaualcoyotl, couldn't be more contradicted with Walle del Bravo's parked streets.
It's a banquet of Mexico City in many ways.
And the problems in the bed are too hard and city.
In this year, it was called to help me deal with drugs that were working in the army, and it's especially a lot of violence against women.
The body of the woman who was killed in two years was thrown into a empty part of the blanket area.
By the time Mr. Pena Nieto ruled, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, which is more than the Ciudad Juarez, known for malicious women.
Mr. Pena Nieto says that even when the criticism was the best job, she couldn't go to the problem of a woman's critical problem.
The worst thing they blame is to ignore his rule.
She's trying to fight with her tears when she showed me her photos of Maria Luna.
According to the events, Mariana killed in 2010.
But his family believes he was killed by his partner.
He remembers, "When I went home, his body was was washed."
He had a watch to show that he had been rubbed, and he had already started the tyrant of death.
As his mother's story again, she looks down a picture of Mariana's wall, one of the hair that has one word on it.
But he said that this family was rejected.
The State authorities treated me as an old rumor, a problem, a spot.
What they want is that people accept what they say simplely and shut their lips.
He says, "It can't be true when there are so many disorders and lacks."
President Pena Nieto comes with him with heavy responsibility.
Ten thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico for six years, and they have promised to put priority in their new president.
PRI's a member of the PRI convention, Olvera, says in Valle del Bravo, "I think it's a president as a president."
But that's what the victims in the Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Prosecutors claim that Bradley Manning didn't complain about bad conduct.
Prosecutors are trying to resist Bradley Manning's claims to use bad.
Don't stop, Manning's Quantico focuses on the time when he's in the military prison in Virginia.
The Court wants the case to end because Manning's imprisonment was hard.
Every thousand secret documents in the army are accused
The judicials tried to tell us that he lost the opportunity to complain about the evil claims that he had been in the military when he was accused of the most secret marital in the history of the United States.
Ft. before the meeting in Meade Maryland, the prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein Manning said that it wasn't wrong with one of the principal officials who were watching Virginia for nine months.
A day after the Celse was hard and imprisoned, and it was not long enough for Manning to end the case of Manning.
In June 2010, the army was accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in Irak when the army was arrested.
Later, Materyal was published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning's source.
During the summer interview, Fein studied with Manning the forms that were captured from June 2010 to April 2011, which had been arrested by Quantico military prison after the meeting with Manning.
Officials have asked Manning and noted their answers.
When Fein asked about forms on Saturday, Manning's prison guards said that it was "Greek" and all the behavior of the cycle was "a lot of professional".
Forms don't show a bad act, and the officers have asked Manning directly about his behavior.
Manning said his fears about the matter, and he said that the visitors were talking about their concerns and that they would not record the subjects.
Manning said, "Don't have any 'considered' and it doesn't mean that it doesn't say anything."
Justice Yarbay Denise Lind de Manning asked why he did not complain about the instinctive attitudes he mentioned in January 2011.
Manning responded that his motive was the case of the "speaking of the crying".
The army said that the suicide has made him and others less than six to protect him.
Manning said, "I wanted to know I'm good, and I wanted to get out of the POI's condition... to enjoy the quality of a life because of my view."
Manning's being arrested in Irak on Thursday, and in June 2010, Marine Base Quantico was transferred about two months before a military prison in Virginia.
He said he thought about his murder in Kuveyt, and he said he was cured there once because he was warm.
He said it was stressful that he was not allowed to know what was happening and what was outside.
He said, "My world's cafe, Camp Arafjon's kidnapped."
I thought I'd die in that cafe.
Manning, when he went to Quantico, said most of his days, at least 21 hours, and often, he was alone in a small cell.
Manning said only a bed, a bed, a battery, the bars between the bars, the clothes and the eye.
He said he was trying to move, because he said that sleeping in the day, and even gravity was independent of the rules.
Manning's always slept with light that comes out of his cell.
When he returned to the night, the prisoners said they woke him up and returned him.
Manning's lawyer found a picture of the actions done to Manning on January 2011.
Manning moved to the military prison in Kansas in Fort Leavenworth, April 2011.
And he also asked if the Court was forced to stay in front of the jail at the ceremony in Quantico's cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand before the prisoners and the rest of the rest of the courts.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to cover him with the bathroom.
The judge's questioning on Saturday, he said that he should throw a bathroom out of Manning's command that he might be jumped.
Manning told the officer that he had been forced to sleep on the last night because he showed her that she wasn't safe for her.
The man's officer told the man's inner bell can hurt himself by using a bel dumb or by the species of his fingers, but he didn't do that.
Manning pointed to that night, it was taken from the cells of the inner tonight, the range of the fingers, and their eyes.
The lawyer expects at least to take into account the experiences of the prison and to reduce the trial of the military court in the front of the next year.
The Safeguard Manning's plans that Manning would admit his crime in smaller crimes, and he would fight for the very extreme crimes.
During this week's end of this week, it's planned to continue, and it's expected that the prosecutors have been arguing about the condition of the surveillance.
Pentagon Manning has been held according to the rules in Quantico about all the magnificent administrations in Quantico.
Those who are among Manning's advertisements are the thief of the enemy, to help the enemy, to be transmitted on the Internet, to convey national protection information, and the thieves of the records.
If he's putting judgment on all the things, he's going to face the possibility.
American I'm a Mexican ID criteria
It's said that many people were forced to leave Mexico because they had no opportunity.
Mexicans try to criticize those who are separated; they tell Mexicans that they remember hard times.
Navarrette says the Americans of Mexicans are striking between two worlds.
I went to Mexico for a close journey to the crowd, and I was surprised.
The marks showed two lines: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mcsicans"), and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Jenns").
I was there a few seconds, I didn't know where I was going.
Because I grew up in the center of California, I was called all my life as a "Mcsica".
Similarly, my friends in this ethnic stenod in Boston say "Irlanda" or my friends in New York's "Italian."
I decided in America later in Mexico.
But it was Mexico.
And my grandfather's country didn't need stenoya or stairs.
I was a American normally.
I'm talking Spanish, and I'm so good to control the two sides of a conversation in this language.
But I don't have the local words, and I can't get rid of my American disappearance.
That's why I took my American passport, and I went back to exnjeros.
I thought it was when I visited the Mexican Prince Enrique Pena Nieto President Obama in this week.
In my day, when the chiefs of two countries meet, it's all the time: move, drugs, and business.
Pena Nieto was eager to talk to Mexico about the growing economy of the Mexican economy that the Mexicans were trying to get into the United States now.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and make a commerce block in Europe in northern America.
Pena Nieto hasn't recommended anything clearly, but he swore that Mexican would continue to fight with drug cards.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is full of complicated and negative feelings.
Most Americans may have never thought that the United States worked Mexico in 1848 and tried to force their leaders to give half of their lands.
But it's not mines, some of the Mexicans who think about in the centuries are everywhere.
So when an American official speaks a little criticism about Mexico, you start to say a complaint about the Mexico base and between the hands of the Americans's neighbor's rule.
And Montezuma's children are going to fight.
And, however, the really difficult relationship for Mexico is with the Americans who live in the United States, over 35 million.
Do you want to talk about negative feelings?
There's too much.
The winners and those who have lost in Mexico are the people who made an opportunity in the country and the people they haven't created.
Many Mexican people in the Mexicans have to live in towns like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio.
And mostly this person follows a profile -- a little education, a poor village.
We are their offspring, and We make them chains.
Not Mexican.
And we can never forget the fact that we've been living a good school and found good things, not Mexico, but the American Reason.
Sometimes our identity may not be known, but it's clear.
It's the United States.
And we also realize that most of the Mexicans in the college class don't love us.
It's kind of feeling.
They view us as a reminder of a despicable defeat, and they look downstairs like we weren't enough of Mexicans.
The Spanish will never be good enough, and our bonds with Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our way of life is about complete failure in their eyes.
If our families were not in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't have found ourselves closed at the back of the blue cover, but they live well in the United States, but they're lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, came to the United States as a child, reminds me that Mexicans and the Americans are more steadyer than they are.
Despite his U.S. citizens, he thinks he is part of two countries.
At the same time, most of the Mexican Americans don't feel like a part of them.
And we like to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You're taking the best of the two worlds, but you're not rooted in any of them.
We look as American in Mexico.
We're accepting Mexican in the United States.
Now, like I've learned in my trip, some Mexican leaders and some lights want to be reunited with Diaspora.
The Mexican American Americans want to work as temporary Mexicans to show their interest in the United States.
We're trying to tell the Americans how beautiful you are to visit them, and we're trying to strengthen their relationship with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't happen.
There's a lot of negative feelings.
And we're not sure that this is a wonderful country, with the independentness of the incomparableness of the world, and the practice of drug abuse and drug abuse.
I'm afraid you're alone, friends.
That's right.
If some Mexicans are not ready to forgive Mexico for their actions, at least half a century ago, some Mexicans have to admit that some Americans are still offended for what they have done nearby to their family.
Hmmm.
Maybe, "We're Micsians more than I thought."
Old Wars, New Middle East
The fires between Israel and Hamas may be a base of peace.
Is there always peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood wound shows that this hope is worthless.
Among the unsuccessful controversys of who started, many buildings became encamped, more than 140, and more of the Philistines and six Israelite people were killed, and the first time, from Gazze, the big city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Israel.
But even though the Israelites and the Philistines seem to be stubborn in their old conflicts, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arabian fragments dropped up to the air, and the Philistines and the Israelites were caught in the region.
Maybe this makes their fight more bloody than the former.
But there are reasons to think that this could break their killers.
What the Favour of the Favour
It looks hard to be right in the first view.
The fiery fires continued on November 21, but the war in both sides of this week strengthens the stages.
The Muslim act of Hamas, who ruled Gazze since 2007, will claim that the provinces of Gazze were defeated, but the Israelites were forced to return.
Despite their killing some of their leaders, and 1.7 million people of Gazze were able to destroy Israel's Hamas in one of the most terrible and multitude corners of the world.
Of course, the other part of Hamas Philistin's now ruled by the large conquests in Fatax is winning the middle of Philistine in West Shiria.
More than that, the leaders of Hamas could also make the sense that the time was with them.
As the Muslims gained the Arabic world, Hamas became strong and rich friends.
The Regional government of Israel, the nearest Muslim in ancient Israel, took his purpose to Turkey Hamas, and so was Katar, one of the most wealthy and most religious.
The glad Hamas people say that my Muslim grandmother from Lübnan to the northern part of the Hizbullah army of Israel was invaded to the Syria, and Hamas, the king of Hamas, threatened by the king of Hamas.
In addition to all, between the southern parts of Arabs of Israel’s Israel’s Canaan, he changed the balance of the province of Muslim brothers in Egypt, which was the most important and importantest in Egypt.
To the fall of 2011, there was a little time for the Middle Hamas, who ruled Egypt for 30 years.
On the contrary, the brotherhood's brother Hamas's cousin and its leaders are more subjects.
In the future diplomas, Hamas can be an actor, even Israel and the Americans.
At that time, the guards of Israel will bring the opposite results.
In the case of the warrior, Hamas's back.
Demir Kubbe has confirmed the value of the anti-fix system of Israel, and many of Hamas's physician's physicians are destroyed.
The Israelites will be more comfortable for a while.
According to diplomatic, the American country, most European countries accused Hamas about starting the last violence.
Besides all, Israel was born under the rule of the headquarters, especially in the city of Netanyahu, who ignored the peace process.
Although the rokets from Gazze had killed some 30 Israelite since 2004, Israel had been saved less than a few of the curtains who were invaded to West Sheria, the main part of the Philistine state of the Philistine, and the international law.
While the Likud party went to the choice in January 22, Mr. Netanyahu's more complicated with Avigdor Lieberman's war group.
Why are these false Philistines happy with their own governments?
If they really manage West Sheria, they're not going to hit the roket like their foreigners in Gazze?
It is better for them to hold them behind the wall and to punish them when they have lifted their heads.
Maybe the inspectors win, but they can change Arabian accounts.
The Muslims have gained power in Egypt, and the other places have little love for Israel, but the most important thing is to cope with problems in their home.
Israel's defense bridge is greater than the combination of Arabs.
Fighting with the local power does not help new Arabic governments to correct their economy.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked along with Barack Obama, to make a fire, and maybe they can start something.
The Israelites should look to the long time.
As the rest of the Arabian world is more democratic, the Philistines are made up of a bus, like a bus in Tel Aviv, which is ripped under Israel's business areas.
The pressure in the Jewish State has already bleeding the democracy and the Arabic population is burning democracy.
In a few years, the bloody tasks against Gazze will reach a diplomatic price to exterminate Hamas.
He needs encouragement on the two sides.
The answer is made known from both sides of the world and by these wise men, the two governments that Israel represents security.
A little hope in the short time, this purpose will give some strength to foreigners a little more force.
Now, it's better to convince Gazze to stop the guns of guns, Egypt, Turkey and Catar with Hamas, based on the boundaries of 1967, to accept Hamas and accept the idea of a common Kudüs.
And foreign Arabs should force Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This is much more useful than the imagination of a physician government in the BM.
Mr. Obama plays the role of bringing Israel to the table.
In the first time, he neglected to offer his own peace plan.
It looks unrealistic to get in the white Saray.
It doesn't seem to be a bit tragic.
America's accompanied by a Student Middle East.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Philistines.
Cigarette's laws of smoking packets in Australia
Smoking warnings and diseased organs are put in simple gray boxes for all ticking markets
The first law on cigarettes and smoking in the world has been engrossed in Australia, putting the marka logos and colors in the place of the globes, the horrifying pictures of the diseased organs, and the babies of their parents's cigarettes.
The only difference between the packets and various health warnings and images will be printed by the same small font of the market names from Saturday to Saturday.
I'm the worst register to pack the chicken in this world.
Australia’s federal government says that the purpose of the goal is to stop youths from smoking by renouncing them from the custom of ceremony.
It's based on research that if people do not start cigarette until 26 years of age, 99% of them will not be able to start.
"You can see that the children are trying to sell the markets since they were very young."
Australia has one of the lowest smoking cigarettes in the world, and changes have little influence on the blood of many nations, but the other countries think the same steps.
The cigarette was a hard lobby against the law.
The cigarettes said they would support the cigarettes, and they'd be able to cigarette more and more.
Scott Intyre from British American Tobacco in Australia said, "It's going to be unresponsive results."
In China and Indonesia will bring more of these products to sell them in Australia's streets.
Others say that the law has increased the work.
A little family company, Zico Importy Ltd, is a two months before the British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco in England, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco's higher courts.
She says Zico was selling over 6,000 in the balls and waiting for a new stack.
That's a good job for us.
Experts say that the potansial trade is a democracy in a democracy plan.
A series of Australia law banned televisions and sports, and many sellers were asked to keep cigarettes from the visible places.
Australia has banned the Internet companies and sites, but the sea isn't restricted.
Becky Freeman in Sydney University, a publicly health explorer in Sydney University, said, "If you're on a typhouse and the only small window is left to reveal your products, you must be online.
Freeman markets said that the social media, such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, has increased in social media studys.
We need to ask that Marlboro's cigarettes, is it really a civil citizen and a video-to-singing company, or is it in that?
British American Tobacco said he was focusing on the new rules.
Industri Ukraine, Honduras, and Dominican Republic, the country claimed that the business was restricted unjustly.
A WTO decision is in the middle of 2013.
He said that the government had intervened with other countries who were thinking about the similar packages.
In 2001, the first country in Canada was the one who forced the photos.
These are now over 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
In England, New Zelanda, South Africa, and India, there are more severe laws.
Most people in Australia have cigarettes.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm not aware of them.
When he bought a packet with a photograph, Victor El Hage said, "Take a cigarette and put it over."
If it's true, there's just one reason to leave, and she's my little girl.
In the center of Sydney, James Yu, who runs the King of the cooking shops, says that the only packing traffic painting is a challenge.
Yu said, "I'm not going to free a Muslim, he'd take me a hour before, and now he takes four hours."
He said, "The government had to be banned all, then, okay, we're done, we're gonna shut your shop up."
It's not bad for us to suffer in a world that's always affluent
I've spent five hours in the air when we had to wait for a plane at this feast of this Thanksgiving day and we had to wait for another plane.
So I've been too much time to think about tiring.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Although waiting for the airport in half airport, it's very traumatic, books, magazines, and iPhones, I don't tell you about the trauma.
But in some cases, some akademisis and experts in the development of the child.
They say it's normal for us and our kids.
He's trying to force his brain to go to interesting tangents, and maybe it increases the creativity.
And most of us have experience the benefits of being tired because we're connected to the other screen.
So we're gonna be hungry?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll be back to this.
First of all, I thought it's a new idea, as if it's going to be more busy than many people.
In Canada, Peter Toohey is not like a professor of Greek and Roman history professor in Calgary in Canada.
He said, "It's really a long time for you to be sick."
There's a Latin wall in the first century of Pompei.
There's a question of how we're tired.
The problem is that this is known in many ways, and it's disputed, says Ontario, John D. D. Eastwood, a psychology at the University of Canada.
After looking at the research license, the idea was placed in front of a hundred people's rooms, Professor Eastwood and the colleagues said that it's a "infecting, but not in competition."
It's not a person's going to be busy, but it's what he wants to be.
He said he has nothing to do in guests.
The corresponding experience of compromising said, "It's a deterioration of the time and the sense of slowness."
Depression can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood may be about, but the people who are stubborn are in a complicated environment or world, but the depressed people view the problem as themselves.
Sometimes we think we're stunned when we're trying to be concentrated.
In September, Professor Eastwood and his classmates signed an old experiment in the magazine, published by Psychological Sciences: Declaring the Declaration of September, a journal of a journal of one reader's story.
Some groups heard a television program in the side of the room, which is unsearchable, and others heard that it is very little in low level, but the third group has never heard.
Those who heard the television are reporting more loud than the other two groups, they found it hard to be concentrated, but they were not sure why they were.
One of the college writers and Mark J. Fenske, who in the Guelpi University of the University of Ontario, said that the interest can be disturbed when you focus on a hard or busy task.
On the other side, when you read something that is a bit bitch, it can help you to keep watching bad tools in a factory.
Actually, the scorn and democracy that often appears to be a common sign of suffering can make people more vulnerable to physically compromise.
Professor Fenske said, "The kids who have been allowed to be active are learning more than the children who have been forced to move and have more knowledge."
We're all going to experience trouble in some points, my flight's late, a monoton talker.
But some people are in the tendency to be more intimidated than others.
To help me analyze this, researchers developed a "Emperor Education" in the 1980s.
There are many questions, "I have many things I've got to do." And I have a lot of interest, and I have no time to do anything."
Steven Vodanovich, a psychologist at West Florida University, said that researchers have found that women are more often in need of more and more incredibly in need of different customs than the girls.
But most of the teens are a team.
In 1991, in Illinois University, a experimentator of human and social development, Reed Larson, who had spent seven times contacting with his parents and about 400 teenagers and parents.
He found the 32 percent of the adults in school and in the payment, but when they weren't in school 23 percent of the girls.
On the other side, they said the parents were stabbed three percent of parents.
Professor Larson said that 21 years later, they don't know if they're better or lower.
But he said that it wasn't so much control over what he wanted to do with the children and the gants that he knew it was the traffic time.
So I'm back to my first question: Is it good for a man to be tired?
At times, the research shows that people can be insignificant risks, gambling, or using material.
On the other side, Professor Vodanovich, who has been working over two more than two, said, many philosophers and writers are quarreling the connection between creative and creative.
Gary Marcus, a psychology professor in N. U.U., said, "Flee is the way you should do something else to you."
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you're tired, and use this energy to play the guitar and to eat, it will make you happy.
But if you watch television, it can make you happy at a short time, but it's not long.
Professor Fenske said that if you give him a iPad, he wouldn't be uncomfortable, but he doesn't learn to be fun or organize himself.
And he said, "It's a way to move himself to the other condition."
Your child doesn't just learn to have fun, and he's more self - control in other areas.
I don't think we'd really want to be tired.
We shouldn't be so critical.
Rather, our goal should be to be calm before we're not getting over the interactive and technology.
Professor Eastwood joined.
He said, "We need to be more frustrating, but it's the desire to be intimidated with something uncomfortable."

No Senaryo for New Marihuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a college student in 19 southern Colorado, and a football player in the district of the country has to be accused of something that will be legally legal in the country.
One day in September, Mr. Orosco said he and his friends were stopped at Lamar, while they were traffic in the Kansas border.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco everybody was called for $100 dollars, $100 $100, and was given a case for the case.
He said, "We were treated as a criminal."
But is he like that?
The answer of a few weeks of uncertain drug cases of the Colorado's regulation of marijuana is more dependent than the law.
It's already closed in Washington, the case of hundreds of lowly criminals.
When the police were 21 years old and older ones in the next weeks, they stopped registering a minority for the legal movement.
But in Colorado, the prosecutors swore firmly to maintain the marihuana cases that were available in the Colorado, and they're still calling people to court for moving.
They also use a game to prevent marijuana's markets from a few towns from Denver to the West Mountains.
Aurora's police officer in the east of Denver, Daniel J. Oates said, "This is so fast, and I don't know what will happen next."
The editors at Washington State are caught up with their heads.
And the last history, on December 1, 2013, has been looking for direction to build a license system for transition, distribution, and selling.
They say that Colorado's first use of medical medicine, and now they say it's in front of the country of marijuana in the use of entertainment.
The Washington International Control Organization, Brian E. Smith said, "Courado has more regular piano, so they will be a good guide."
But Mr. Smith said that no place or system can do more than suggesting what will be done.
He said, "There is no real example we can do."
The law of Washington's I-502 will be intervened on December 6, and the country will leave a year of uncertain movement, but it's not yet possible.
In the meantime, there are hard questions to solve, such as schools, parks, children, or children's center of the country's restrictions to reproduce the marijuana of 10,000 miles [000 km] away.
The New Student Center of Center Ben Livingston said: “It is not harder to keep the license rearse in anywhere, especially the city of Seattle is a big city. ”
In the 21th November, the Chief Oates sent a e-mail to the officials in Aurora, who said that the city lawyer would not interfere with the 21-year-old marijuanas, and that the police would leave people to be accused of these crimes.
The Chief Oates said that the city rules and drugs will be followed by the medicine medicine creators.
The district officer Ken Buck represents a more serious view in the North Colorado district.
The office said that the office will continue to watch the marijuana's cases of getting the users to get medicine.
There are many other accusations that are being accused of carrying about the 20th or less marijuana.
Mr. Buck said, "We have a force to interrogate criminals in the case of our office."
The answer was complicated even in lands, such as the Air Force, who refused the marijuana contract.
The police at Grand Junction in the largest town of the region don't have any case for adults.
Pete Hautzinger, a district officer of the region, supported this decision, but he decided not to shut down the trade cases that awaited him.

It would never be easy for the government and the legal system to get the funds to make the funeral academic marijuana.
And the common controversy in the country reveals a deep impact between the local authorities.
Denveran lawyer and Marihuana's law Reformation of the National Organization, says, "It's a conscientious bariyer."
He said, "They have spent most of their lives in judging, so they still do not acknowledge that this is right."
As the first parts of the marijuanajan, they are ready for national tests in order to register the correspondence of Colorado and Washington.
The lawyer and government are also expecting the Federal government to be guided by the government, who plans to sell marijuana and produce it as a federal crime.
The administrators of the legal marihuana hope that the Righteous Minister of Justice would be resigned.
Despite the medical marijuana marijuana, the Federial government has allowed them to work on the Colorado, Washington, and the 16 countries.
Obama's former drugs politician Kevin A. Sabet said that they will not rub the doors to catch a little drug deal, but they're not allowing the funds of marihuana's markets that have been established by the new law.
Some cities in Colorado don't expect the federal authorities to act.
Even before the selection day, some local governments accepted the payment of the new marijuana stores that may be opened for nearly one year.
The last week, Montrose banned the city of Montrose for six months, and it is possible to accept the next week.

Who's got a monthly numbered.
I'm trying to put my experiences to the experts of the Republic students in this way and to help the problems you encounter in social security, or to give them my experiences to you.
You're going to meet hundreds of news in social security and employment.
I'm going to give you the right, the most healthy, trustworthy news.
First of all, I want to take a lot of sounding in the sanctuary.
We will consider these books that will continue in the parchment in sections.
You can find answers to all the questions about the wealthy in our letters.
You can send your questions from the Alizer.com.
I'll be very active to answer you at the moment.
What's the business?
MALULEN has been able to compensate the SK and Committee of the SGK in order to kill the independences of the SGK and the Councils of the SGK to kill their lives.
In fact, they can also be employed if they have lost the strength to earn their jobs, apart from the above, in the case of their colleagues.
Who's worthless?
I'm writing from Diyarbakir, my name is Mehmet Gulkin, I have 920 days incorrect and I've got 1460 days of military.
Also, I'm a magnificent disease.
I'm connecting to the diyaliz machine.
I'm still working in a job.
Can I get a fortune?
- Honest Bey's first.
You didn't tell me the first time you've been working in your problem.
But let's tell you a brief story about how to bind up the month of wealth.
First of all, the most important conditions given by the law have to be insignificant for ten years, and 1800 days of your prime day.
Also, when SGK is established with health, you know that you have lost at least 60 percent of your employees, or the result of a job accident, you have lost at least 60 percent of the power to get a job.
But you're giving 60 percent of your diagnostic disease here because you're not filling the number of 1800 principal days.
Of course we don't know how many years you've worked.
On the day you spent 10 years and 1800 days together, SGK will be a monthly convenient for you to leave your job.
Problems of money for a month
Cann't anybody in 1800 days rent for a ten years?
- 1800 days of principal payment must be complete.
But there is only one statistic, and for those who decide that they are independent of the other, they have a ten years of insignificance, unless they are looking for the other conditions.
What diseases or diseases will be listed in the advanced sections of our letter, which we need to make sure that people who are infected with diseases or diseases will always be needed.
The condition of the victims before they start to work
I'm Ahmet Guards.
While I moved all the conditions in the SGK law, they said to me, because I was first sick before I went to work, you wouldn't get a casual month.
I'm very magnificent.
Isn't it wrong?
How would I be a worker?
- Ahmet Bey, you wrote all the conditions that you have found in the Law, but it should not be possible for the SKK and the colleagues who are part of the law to work.
Because you're not moving this condition, it can't be connected.
But when you have a aged registration, you may be retired.
- I have 3980 days, and I've been insurmounted for 16 years.
It's known by SGK that my money was defined before working.
They told me you can't be a businessman.
I'll do what to do in this case.
I can't work.
Can you guide it?
- Yeah, you heard the truth.
You can't work.
But in the SGK law, there's a registration register for you.
Well, there's two cases before October 2008 and later.
If you start working for the first time before this, SGK may at least take a short time of 15 years of insurance and the number of 3600 primarily days before you work.
So we're recommending you to go to the nearest SGK manager for a monthly binding.
But if you were to go to work after 2008, you could have been insignificant for at least 15 years, and you could have been predicted for at least 3960 days of poverty, old age, and death.
Is it necessary to leave the job when it's up?
I'm working as a driver in a business officer.
When I went to the hospital, I was appointed a cancer.
I want to be a businessman.
Should I leave the workplace in this case?
I'm not going to get to the destitute.
I don't want to stay without work until the month's tied.
- You heard the right thing.
You have to leave the job to give a monthly binding request.
But before a month intervention, you need to count an mall by the SGK law.
But if you are in debt, it will be a monthly consummate to you with other circumstances.
It doesn't mean to give a monthly binding, you have a risk to lose a job.
That's enough for 1800 days.
When you go to SGK and make a request to recognize my wealth, SGK will send you to one of the hospitals.
And when you go to SGK, you've got a health report from here, and you're going to get it to SGK, the SGK will check this report in his own health code, and if you decide that your cancer's power affects your infantty percent of 60 percent.
But if you have to fill up the ten years of insurance for your month, you may be able to be attached to you a month.
I mean, it's not unwise to say that the employees's SGK health Committee, "You're unnecessary" decision.
But if the insults are not working at any job, the SGK will ask for an experiment of the financial condition and a month's corresponding.
If this is a casual and other circumstances, it may be useful for him to start a few months earlier.
Will the Bind-Rack be a loan?
I'm an insurance.
I'm carrying all the conditions.
But they said, because I owe you a debt.
What should I do?
- I'm worth it.
Anybody told you the truth.
You didn't write what the other conditions are, but if you think you're carrying these conditions, it's the law to pay your debt.
But I can give you a special tie.
I'm recommending you to pay your debt by using banks or similar institutions.
The sooner the next month, you'll get so much months, and you'll pay your debt for a moment.
These institutions will be easy for you to pay back for what they have done in your month.
What strategy is it connected to the money month?
I've worked as a SSSK-Band-Rod and the capital.
When I deserve the month, where's she gonna join me for a month?
- My valuable reading, if you work for a lot of statistics, SSS, and officer, you'll be connected with more than one, the magnificent statues, the last time you've been insignificant, the last time you've been insignificant, you'll get out of the work and you'll take a month from SSS.
SGK reports of patients
How's the investigation?
What hospitals can I get a health report?
- You're dependent on social security managers or social security centers for health health reports.
SGK will send you to the hospitals, to the university, to the university, and to the hospitals, in addition to the college and the capital.
But if you've been in the country where these hospitals are not found, it is also possible to move to the full health caregiver to the hospital.
It can't be sent to a special hospital, right?
- It's possible, but it's possible.
In the old arrangement, it's also a special hospital report that you have been able to be healthy and risky patients to be able to be able to have a love for the patients that are in their sleeping hospitals and to be able to do with the new administration of SGK, which will now be accompanied with a serious health problem, and it will also be considered to be a special hospital that can be cured by the risk of life.
What are some conditions called for love processes?
The insurance in SEVK is enough to be an impriminal 1800 days in order to determine the financial condition.
It's going to be paid by the SGK.
And he's not looking for the ten years of insurance, SGK looks at this.
In the case of the magnificence month, if a person is in need of measure, he is able to find the ten years of insignificance between the insurance conditions, only enough for 1800 days.
So when a person first discovers his malignity, SGK comes to see the need for a measure of necessity in 1800.

When sound technologies or sound engineering, everybody's headed by sound systems of music.
And if you knew that the terrorism could be hindered by sound technology, that the sound frequency could be a perfect murder, you could love someone you want, you could confess a secret, or you could comply with the ritism of the world?

"A technology that can be used in many areas in the world.
Our brain recognizes everything with electricity.
Sound frequency is a type of electricity, energy.

One of the most important substances of sound technology is subliminal message.
The music or song is placed in a frequency of a frekans, which can't be identified by this upper memory, but it goes down to the underlying memory.
For example, when a terrorist attack is fetched, Pamir said that he could make a music literature in that area.
If the frequency has been changed, like "Don't hit this attack", the terrorist's altogether will notice the message.
He doesn't understand what he hears, but his submear memories see it, and a voice comes out to him as if he called him "appma".
He sees it as a message from God.
But in the world and in Turkey, these messages are absolutely banned and punishment.
And Pamir is a substituted message that has been prepared to tell the students about the subject at a constitution at the Stanbul Technical University.
"I heard a music at the conference.
I put a frequency called "Suu" in the music.
At the end of the presentation, I asked the students that they couldn't be silent.
They said they were so thirsty."
Pamir said that there are those who use subliminal messages, "and some radio channels are recognized, but the details are not yet known.
In Germany, there's a channel called "Kara Voine Radius, a radial festival for the radian Muslims.
The sublimeal method is spreading out messages that are rampant, a religious call for war, and ordered to use drugs.
The German cops know that, and the Turk cops know that, but they can't start because they've changed the frequency.
And in the music world, these dangerous messages are also used.
Especially in songs of some heavy metal groups...
According to these claims, there was even a terrorist in the towers, and the attack was performed by a subliminal commander who called the capital pilots to the substitute.
Cross Wall
Sound technologies can also be used in crime.
In the United States, it's especially used in the bank's license.
For example, when the police came to the phone with the telephone, the sound engineers can determine where the man is in the bank and where he is.
It's different when a statue, a statue, a plastica, a wall, or any other thing.
It is also possible to recognize the largeness of the room that is in line with the sound.
Thus, it is possible to determine what kinds of things are found in the voice of the criminal, which are large and in a room.
And there was a computer program that was used for that, and Pamir even made a opera building from Tataristan, and I calculated that there could be a perfect sound order.
It's not a decorated technology, but it's the value of $4-5,000."
Sound frequency is also used in the mimari and decoratation.
Pamir has a lot of work on this.
For example, in a restaurant in a ceremony ceremony, the restaurant of the businessmen, which wouldn't get out of the meeting room.
He can hear the talks in the table.
Two steps can't hear anything else at the table.
And the system of these types of planets is said: "If you want to destroy a sound, you will discard it with another frequency of molecular molecules, and you will destroy the current sound energy.
Nobody couldn't get on a plane without this system.
'Cause the sound of the plane engine is so higher to be able to endure.
These sounds on the plane are shooting each other and destroying themselves.
Even if your windows are open with this system, you can create a peaceful environment far away from silence in your home."
The Egyptian pyramids were made with sound?
There are other interesting things that Pamir did, the first sound engineers of Turkey.
For example, he made a open air disk of the Airport aircraft that couldn't hear the music voice outside.
The sound can't get out of the edge, and it's comparing with another sound frequency.
If the question is, it can be silent after a certain line in a room.
A pamir has made the sports hall for both the sports and the concert.
I mean, it's used.
Because when we play basketball, we need a side, but the concentrators should not have a side.
And in the openhava concerts, it's possible to make a sound quality of music that can only hear.
"We're using frequencys that can make man's mind clearer.
MTV's very advanced on this.
The openhava concerts are ordering and they hear the studio record of the sound.
That's what Tbitak has done.
Drop two album frequencys between the lyrics.
There were scientists who claimed that the Egyptian pyramids were made with sound.
They thought the stairs could be lifted up with a voice.
I'm asking, "Isn't it easy to use bad motives?"
"When I read the work of Zaten York University on the Internet, I was so afraid that others would read it.
'Cause it's said, "It's the result of the unbelievable results, even those who are good intentions of lab can be tried except the condition of lab."
"Extensive in the Dellyar Arabic."
Sudan Pamir says that the dishonest dishonesty would affect a person in a bad way, he says: “Because all the sounds that your ears hear are sent to the brain.
Of course, the human hears the voice that is the only concentration, but the other sounds send to the brain and actually leads to tiredness.
That's why you need to free your brain, so it's good to walk in the ground and make natural trips.
I think there's to set orders to smok the voice in school.
So the student will have a concentration in the voice of the teacher, and he can take a long time in concentration."
Pamir observes that the prayers have a lot of wealthy curious panpane of the Arabic language, and the quality of the sound frequency of the sounds of the sounds are being organized in a order that the words will be very positive when they come to the side of the voice.
He says, "I need to read your prayers loudly, but when I read your trust, I think I'm insulted."
Love description of frequency
"Is it possible to love a person with sound frequency?"
Don't be loved by Pamir, the frequency diagnosis of man's feelings are said, "You need to find the base frequency that you want to love first.
You can affect her by using a higher frequency than this frequency.
For example, consider that a man has 300 grass.
And you want to play a music that refreshes your feelings while he's with him.
If you lose the power of those who have only 300 frequency on your music, and make the two-frequents, it's the power of that person.
Maybe it's a love for the guy who's at that moment."
Pamir, who speaks of the special sound systems of the world to speak more effectively in the world, can also feel the politician as a powerful, a stadium artist.
And the answer of Pamir said: "It is near at the voice of man, because the voice of man is very close to his voice, which is the most impact of man.
For example, what a wonderful tool is the human being's being produced from his breath."
"The gold prices are going to be uprooted."
The Canadian Jennings Capital Inc. The Analist of the Canadian Jennings Mademtal Analist Dan Hrushewsky said that the government will grow up from the current level of gold, and he will continue to be a safe tool.
In the first half of the Worldwide investigation in the first half of the year, the investment of the global investigation in the first year of the investment of the Friday, the investment of the AA influentation in the Finnish, Hrushewsky, in China, and India, they appear to be supported by the golden purchase, as a coincidence of the Finnishment, and the infectulars of the India, and the infants of China is being involved in this greatly in this way.
Remembering that the Indian was the greatest gold receiver, I remembered, Hrushewsky, "I believe their attempts to manage car accounts now haven't been rare.
People will find a way in this frame."
Hrushewsky will continue to serve in the role of a safe and secure tool.
Many Western governments are forgotten by the curiosity of curiosity.
The governments are trying to reduce their debt by reducing the value of money units.
So the gold prices will come up from the current levels.
"The gold is written in the ability to reduce the risks of the piano."
And the World Punishment Council General Marcus Grub said that there is a physical person who offers a simple, volatile feature of being more complex and volatile philosophy in the finances of the fantastic pianogues, which offers a simple, cheffffaf and trustable features, “Not in the case of the gold, rather than the pianse risks and the risks of the pianse. ”
The golden portphrase of small numbers has proved that it's more stable and more difficult to meet the inconvenient and unfaithful."
Grub signing that the gold investigation was in the last 10 years, "Status, in less than 1 percent of the world’s resources.
This means the piano's still important opportunities to grow up in the gold collaboration.
In this gravity, it is evidence that the 78 percent of the 78 percent of gold and skeptics are protected by the investor's interest underwear.
"Hindistan has to increase national gold statues to support economic advancement."
The biggest gold physician of the Earth and China, Grub said that in the second frequency of the golden fragment year, the quantity of the gold and nugget of the second year, it has increased the traffic business in Asia.
Grub reminds us that the celebration in China was worth 54 percent, and in India is 51 percent.
Grub said that if there was a high treasuries, the Chinese cash was usually silent in the second half of the purchase.
Then, in April, when the gold prices fell unexpectedly, the quantity came up, and the sands of the sand are already lost.'
In India, Grub, in India, the government's restrictions of gold councils, and the Indian Merkez Bank has taken a multiplied prediction to support the rubies and to reduce the taxes, and this is why the rights can be met with the channels.
He believes that the World Council should be viewed as a strategic investment in the way of the Indian politics.
And they also found that the long-time political system should increase national gold statues to support financial advancement.
Global Golden Rules
According to the "General Golden Trends of Earth" Worldwide, the second week of the year, the global diplomacy of 856,3 tons, and 508 tons of gold.

During this period, in China, the extraordinary request in China continued to grow strongly, and the hope of the prices will grow in the future of the past year has increased 87 percent, and it has reached 276 to that year.
In India, the government raised up taxes in the first diamond in the gold coat, but in the past year, 71 percent became 310 ton of 310 tons.
