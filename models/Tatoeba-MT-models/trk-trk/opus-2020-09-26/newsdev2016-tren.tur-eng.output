Norveç's rakfesk: Is this the most lucky fish in the world?
Five million people of Norveç enjoy the highest standards of life, not only in Europe but in the world.
Can the secret of the country's success be linked to some of the local fishing fish?
Take a time for the past peer.
Put them in the middle of a warm futbol form.
Leave it a week.
Now you have a big Norveç tat, you have a rake coffee.
I'm in the little Fagernes town, about three hours away from Oslo.
There's a car, a great manzara, and this smell is always in the air.
Rakfisk is freed, and it's a huge fish that you love. It's a fermented fertilized until a year.
When the dark and the air smoking, Norwegians are gathered here for a festival of the most fascinating food.
He says, "You'll eat this temporarily, and then you'll eat a little cake aquait."
People around us eat small fish clusters and put a lot of drink.
Auard says, "Some people like aquavait more than rakit."
He can kill the drinking smell.
I'm calling a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting the bottom of your burst, it's not bad, it's unthinkable from a little bus trip after a long bus.
Before Rakfisk Norveç's buzdox, it's a very different product of the fish in the middle of the air, water and salt.
Then, when it's deeper in the winter, it's taken out, and, of course, it's certainly bleeding with alcohol.
Just one generation was forced to leave their country to search for thousands of Norways, mostly moved to the United States.
Now the people are fastening -- more than 13% of the people are moved by the ranks, high payings, and the widely care system.
It's the people from Sweden, who's more rich than Norwegian recently.
Rakfisk represents something important, even though Norveç's history is a part of life.
Among the most expensive foods you can buy.
But everything's worth -- you give a little little little $9 (14) to a sandviç.
Norwegian doesn't always come to the world's news, and many people like that.
The people here still don't want to talk about the name Anders Breivic, who killed 77 men and women and kids with weapons.
Instead, it's called "22 July".
Norwegians find it hard to believe that in the peaceable lands, one of them is able to do such violence and murder.
Since the 1970 ’ s, the world has grown up by one of the biggest petterols and minor sections of Norveç's modern wealth.
Our grippy Anna Nordie's imagination is a long-time white hair and awesome blue technical physician technical techniques, saying, "It's not the only reason we're doing so well."
How do you think we are a people modest?
English, as most people here are, perfect.
We're not a lot of showers, we don't like champagne.
Norwegian petrol is very careful to control his wealth, except a little percent of the currency that comes from the end, all of them have a special distribution for the future generation.
When all others were hungry with the money they had not, the years they went to the global malitic crisis, he closed the dungeons of Norveç cat.
Anna says, "We're happy as long as we are able to walk the mountain with the light."
He adds, "Ve rakfisk coffee."
I'm standing in the snow, and I'm waiting for something, I'm eating enough rakk.
Now there's a handmaster, of course, a different thing and a better taste.
But there's more than that huge fish tonight.
One of the numbered guests I was staying in the rakpassk evening, here are the best guests, and maybe they're going to play the most hardest fish.
There's a live television connection on a rakfisk pepional server.
It's like a Eurovidion's racing.
"How much do you have for the best fish in the mountains?"
"We're here, Andard."
They're laughing, there's some coffee.
A man falls from the chair, maybe it's in the power of aquavait.
Or maybe all these fish's smell.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces a severe start
As the new president of Mexican President President Enrique Pena Nieto's office, Will Grant looks at the challenges and the challenges of his people.
Mexican traffic is especially bad now.
While in the best time, the city was stubborn, since Monday, it became a creepy people who cut different traffic roofs in the capital roads.
But the purpose was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protestotors from reaching the Mexican.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto will take the president of the nation.
It's a hard task.
In the Mexican Calderon of Felipe, he had a financial success in Mexico, but he was controlled by a drug war that led to death in six years.
Mr. Pena Nieto said to the Oval Offiste of the United States, Barack Obama, to make a big word for the oppression.
I'm going to offer a new security strategy for us to reach this purpose.
Before the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto's previous political experience was in his state of Mexico.
The crowd around the capital is divided into the views of the new leader in this country, which grows up.
A man with the open dictionary
For example, in the Western Valle del Bravo, he remembers love.
Those living here are honored that he performed the cafeteria and created the golden captain.
You can go from the new cars of Mr. Pena Nieto to get to the town, and I'm going to make a big traffic path.
Also, the plakets who call the name are, except the climate of the modern spor center and impressive mobile museum.
"We're looking at him for a real and lasting change," says Mr. Pena Nieto's friend and a convention member of the state of the PRI party, Gabriel Olvera.
Especially we hope that our country's very interesting and real change of security and economy is needed.
After 81 years of unfailing power, PRI was ripped by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The convention member Olvera admits that 12 years after Los Pinos' President, the participation of the participation was a lot of expecting Enrique Pena Nieto.
And the opposition refuses to call the new president himself independent.
A man who is openly called himself by a great country vize.
It's a great governmentman and a man who knows more than any of them.
But that's not what many people have in the other side of the country have with the former rulers.
Ciudad, known as Nezahualcoyotl, couldn't have been more contradicted with Walle del Bravo's parked streets.
A bunch of Mexico City in many ways under the automobiles.
And the problems in the bed are too hard and City.
In this year, it was called to help me fight drugs in the army, and it is particularly rare against women.
The body of the woman's body was thrown into a blank area near the big-sming area, just two years of the last two years.
By the time Mr. Pena Nieto's authority, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexican, which is a lot more than the Ciudad Juarez, known as the murder of most famous women.
Those who criticize Mr. Pena Nieto said he couldn't get enough to get the woman's problem.
In the worst case, they are blamed for being ignored his rule.
She's trying to fight in her tears when she showed me her photos of Mariana Luna.
According to the picture verification of events, Mariana murdered herself in 2010.
But his family believes he was killed by his partner.
He remembers, "When I went home, the body was was was washed."
He had a watch to show him that he had been trapped, and he had a long time for death's violentness.
When she's recounting the story again, she looks down a picture of Mariana's wall, with a hair that has one word on it.
But he said that this family was completely rejected.
The governments treated me like old rumors, troubled, criticism.
What they want is that people accept what they say simplely and shut their throats.
She says, "It's not true when it's so much incorrect and lacking."
President Pena Nieto comes with weighty responsibilities.
The ten thousands of families have been affected by serious crimes in Mexico for six years, and he promised them to put first in their new president.
PRI's a member of the PRI convention, Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, says, "I think it's a president as a president."
But this is what the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Prosecutors say Bradley Manning didn't complain about being bad.
The prosecutors are trying to resist Bradley Manning's arguments to misuse.
Don't stop, Manning's Quantico focuses on the time when he's in a military prison in Virginia.
The court wants to end because Manning's imprisonment is hard.
Every thousand secret documents are blamed on the army
The Court tried to tell them that he lost more than a few of the opportunity to complain about the evil claims he had experienced during the army of Bradley Manning during the most hidden marital in the United States.
Ft. Meade Maryland, the prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein Manning, showed that it wasn't wrong with the officers of the weekly visits in Quantico, until nine months in Virginia.
A day after the Celsede was severely imprisoned, and he was imprisoned, and he had been punished enough, when he thought of Manning's suicide to end the case of Manning.
In June 2010, the army was accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in Iraq, in order to be arrested.
Later, Materyal was published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning was a source of information.
During the summer court, Fein studied with Manning for the forms of jails that were imprisoned from June 2010 to 2011, which were imprisoned in the Quantico military prison.
Officials have questioned Manning's answers.
When Fein Court asked about forms on the day, Manning's actions were "Greekest" and all the conduct of the diagnostic.
Forms don't seem to be wrong, and the officers ask Manning a direct question about his behavior.
Manning's linguistic concerns, and she said that the visitors talked about their concerns and that they would not record the subjects.
Manning said, "Don't have anything to say, and it doesn't mean anything to say."
The judge Yarbay Denise Lind asked why he was not complaining about the suicide that was mentioned in January 2011.
He answered that his motive in the meeting was the case of the "punishment".
The army said that one step of the suicide in order to protect him and others is independent of six boundaries.
Manning said, "I wanted to know I'm good, and I wanted to get out of the POI's condition... to enjoy the quality of a life more than my eyes."
Manning's being arrested in Irak on June 2010 and had been transferred to a military prison in Marine Base Quantico in Virginia.
He said he was thinking about suicide in Kuveyt and he was curious once there.
He said that he was not allowed to know what was happening and what was outside.
He said, "My world's cafe was kidded to Camp Arafjon." Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cafe.
Manning, when he went to Quantico, said most of his days, at least 21 hours and often, he spent more than 23 hours in a small cell.
Manning said only a bed, a bed, a blanket, the fingers, the clothes, and their eyes were given.
He said he's trying to move because he said that sleeping in the day, and even gravity is unrestrained.
Manning's always slept with the light that comes out of his cell.
When he came back tonight, the prisoners told him to wake him up and return him back.
Manning's lawyer found a picture of the actions to Manning in January 2011.
Manning moved to a military prison in Kansas on April 2011.
It also asked if the judge was forced to sleep in the cell in Quantico on the day of Saturday, he was forced to stay in front of the jail and the other cave in Quantico.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to cover him with the bathroom during my number.
She said she had to get out a banquet from Manning's command to jump him out of the jail.
Manning told the officer that he was forced to sleep for the last night because she showed him no danger.
He told the officer that the man's inner bottle can hurt himself by using the bel dumb dumb, or by the finger terms between it, but he didn't do that.
Manning pointed out that night, his inner throat was taken from the cells of the fingers and their eyes.
The judge's hope that the judge will take into account the experiences of the prison, and he will reduce the trial of the military court in the front of the year.
He said Manning's plans that Manning would admit his crime in smaller cases and will fight the crimes that are too much.
In the end of this week, it's planned to continue, and it's expected that the prosecutors have been arguing about the condition of the civilization.
He said that Pentagon Manning was complied according to the rules of all the magnificent administrations in Quantico.
Those who are in the constitution against Manning, who help the enemy, disposed on the Internet, dispensing national protection information, or thieves.
If he's putting judgment on all my capitals, he's going to face the possibility.
Mexican American ID criteria
Many people say they were forced to leave Mexico because they had no opportunity.
The Mexicans try to criticize those who are separated; they say to the Mexicans they remember hard times.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are striking between two worlds.
I went to Mexico in a nearby journey to the crowd, and I was surprised.
The marks showed two lines: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mcsicans"), the other for "Extranjeros" ("Jabbians").
I was there for a couple seconds, I wasn't sure where I was going.
Because I grew up in the center of California, I was called "Meksica" all my life.
In this ethnic stend, my friends in Boston say "Irlanda" or my friends in New York say "Italian" to them.
I decided in America later in Mexican.
But it was Mexico.
And my grandfather's country didn't need stenoya or statue.
I was just American.
I'm talking Spanish, I'm so good to control the two sides of a conversation in this language.
But I don't have your local words, and I can't escape my American disappearance.
That's why I took my America's passport, and I've walked for exnjeros.
This week I thought when the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto President Obama was visiting the White Saray.
In my day, when you meet two countries, you always have to move, drugs, and business.
Pena Nieto was eager to talk to Mexico about the graduation of the economy of the Mexican economics, as it was that the Mexicans were trying to get into the United States now.
He wants to share with the United States and Canada and make a commerce blog in North America.
Pena Nieto hasn't recommended anything clearly, but he swore that Mexico would continue fighting with drug cards.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is full of complicated and negative feelings.
Most Americans may have never thought that the United States worked Mexico in 1848 and tried to force their leaders to do the half of their lands.
But it's not mines, some Mexicans who think about in the centuries are everywhere.
So when an American leader said a little criticism about Mexico, you will start to complain about the colleague of Mexico, and between the hands of the neighborhood.
And Montezuma's kids are going to war.
And yet, the really hardness of the Mexican relationship is with over 35 million Americans who live in the United States.
Do you want to talk about negative feelings?
There's so much.
The winners and those who have lost in Mexican are people who have an opportunity for the country and those who have not created it.
Many Mexican people who live in towns like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, San Antonio, and so many of Mexican people have to live in towns, perhaps one of the populations, or antonio, in Mexico, and southern northward.
And mostly this person follows a profile -- little education, little education, poor village.
We are their offspring, and We have assigned them to them.
Not Mexico.
And we're not living now, but we can never forget the truth of the truth that we've gone to good schools and found good works, not Mexican American.
Sometimes our identity may not be known, but it's clear.
It's to the United States.
And we also realize that most of the Mexicans in the administrator's class don't like us.
It's a feeling.
They view us as a reminder of a degrading defeat, and they look at us from the upstairs as if we weren't enough of Mexicans.
The Spanish will never be better enough, and our relationships with Mexico never have enough.
Our place is in their eyes of complete failure.
If our families weren't in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't have found ourselves closed at the back of the ceiling cover, but they're still in the United States.
In Guadalajara, my wife came to the United States as a child, reminds me that the Mexicans are more inclined to be the people of Mexicans and the Americans.
Despite his U.S. citizenship, he thinks he is part of two countries.
At the same time, most of my meters don't feel like both Americans of Mexicans.
We like to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You're taking the best of the two worlds, but you're not rooted in any of them.
We look as American in Mexico.
In the United States, we are accepted as Mexican.
Just as I learned in my trip to mix the relationship, some Mexican leaders and lights want to be reunited with Diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as temporary Mexicans to show their interest in the United States.
To visit the Americans like us, we're trying to say that there's a good country, and the political leaders are forced to strengthen their bond with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't happen.
There's a lot of negative feelings.
And we're not sure that this is a wonderful country with the incomparableness of the coming, and the pollution and drug violence of most of us.
I'm afraid you're alone, friends.
That's right.
At least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive Mexico for their actions, at least half a century ago, and then some Mexicans have to admit that they are still being kissed for what they have done to their family.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more than I thought.
Old Wars, New Middle East
The fires between Israel and Hamas may be a way of peace.
Is there always peace between Arabs and Jews in Middle East?
Another blood sanctification shows that this hope is empty.
Among the unfailing controversys of who started, many buildings became encamped, more than 140, and more of the Philistines and six Israelite people were killed, and the first time, from Gazze, the big city of Israel and the holy city of the Court.
But even though the Israelites and the Philistines seem to be stubborn in their old conflicts, they change the Middle East around them.
The Arabian fragrances dropped up to the air, and the Philistines and Israel were caught in the region.
Maybe this makes their fight more bloody than before.
But there are reasons to think that this could break their killers.
What it won is a lost war
It looks hard to make the best career right now.
The fiery fires continued in November 21, but the battle of this week strengthened the juices both sides.
The Muslim Hamas, who ruled Gazze from 2007, will claim that Hamas were defeated, but the Israelites were forced to get back.
Although they killed some of their leaders, and 1.7 million people of Gazze were unable to destroy the Israel Hamas in one of the most terrible and multitudes of the world.
Of course, the other part of Hamas's physician's now ruled by the biggest rakes in Fatalian is winning the middle of Phylian war in West Sheria.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas can also make the sense that the time was with them.
As the Muslim in the Arab, Hamas became strong and rich friends.
The reinstated northern of Israel, the nearest Muslim muslim muslim in Israel, took the purpose of Turkey Hamas, and so was Katar, one of the most richest and dynamic regions of Körfes.
The joyous Hamas people say that my Muslim grandmother from Lübnan to the northern part of the Hizblocal military party of Israel, and Hamas, the king of Hamas, was hurled down to the Syria, and the king of Hamas threatened by the king of Hamas.
In addition, between the southern parts of Israel’s Arabian lands in the southern Canaan, he changed the balance of Muslim brothers in Egypt.
It was a little time for the Middle Hamas, who ruled Egypt for 30 years in 2011.
On the contrary, the brotherhood's brother Hamas's brother's cousin and leaders are more subjects.
In the next diplomas, Hamas can be an actor, even Israel and America.
At that time, the guards of Israel will bring the opposite results.
The soldier was back in Hamas box.
Demir Kubbe's anti-physical system, and many of Hamas's physicians were destroyed.
The Israelites will be more comfortable for a while.
According to Diplomatic, the American consistently, most European country accused Hamas about starting the last violence.
Besides all, Israel, especially in the government of the Manain Netanyahu, who ignored the peace process.
Even though the rokets from Gazze killed some 30 Israelite from 2004, Israel was far less free from the capital of the Western Sheria, the main part of the Philistine City, and the international law.
While the Likud party went to the choice at January 22 Ocak, Mr. Netanyahu's more compliant group of Avigordo Lieberman.
Why don't you be happy with these fake Philistines who gave their own government?
If they really manage West Sheria, wouldn't they shoot a roket like their foreigners in Gazze?
It is better for them to hold them behind the walls and to punish them when they lift their heads.
Maybe the guards win, but they can change the Arabian accounts.
The Muslims have gained power in Egypt, and the other places have little love for Israel, but the most important thing is to cope with problems in their home.
Israel's defense bridge is greater than the combination of Arabs.
Fighting with the local power will not help the new Arabic governments to correct their economy.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked along with Barack Obama, to make a look good, and maybe they can start something.
The Israelites have to look at a long time.
As the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, the Philistines are formed a bar fragrance in the Tel Aviv, like a bus that explodes in Israel’s work.
The pressure in the Jewish State has already blue the democracy, and the democracy of the Arab people grows.
In every few years, blood missions against Gazze will reach a diplomatic price to take Hamas off.
He needs encouragement on the two sides.
The answer is made known from both sides of the world and from this wise newspaper, which represents two governments that represent Israel’s safety.
It's a little hope in a short time, that's the purpose of it to force foreigners a little more pressure.
Now, it's better to stop Gazze, Turkey, and Katar with Hamas, who should be able to stop his weapons.
And foreign Arabs should force Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This is much more useful than the imagination of a Physician government in BM.
Mr. Obama plays a role in bringing Israel into a table.
In the first century, he neglected to offer his own peace plan.
It looks unwilling to be taken in white Saray.
It doesn't seem to be a painful one.
America's incredible in the Middle East.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Philistines.
Sigara's simple packets in Australia.
Smoking warnings and diseased organs are put in simple boxes for all ticking markets
In the world of Australia, the first laws on cigarettes and chickens, he leaves the marka logs and colors in the place of the globes, the smoking pictures of the diseased organs, and the baby pictures of their parents.
The only difference between the packets and images between different health warnings and images from the outside of the packets will be complicated with the same font of the same font.
I'm the worst register to pack the teeth in this world.
The Australian federal government says that the purpose of the plan is to stop the young people from smoking by renouncing their cigarettes.
It's based on research that if people do not start cigarette until 26 years of age, 99% shows that they will never start.
"You can see that the children are trying to sell the markets even when they were very young." For example, the Federia Plice shows that the children's psychology is linked to the idea of being a prestige of purchase.
One of the lowest smoking cigarettes of the world, and changes are very little to the blood of many nations, but the other countries also think of similar steps.
The cigarettes have made a hard lobby against law.
The pilots said that they would support their trade if she borrowed it, and they would make more money and more available cigarettes.
British American Tobacco from Australia, Scott McIntyre said, "It's going to be unprecedented results."
The Chinese and Indonesia will bring more of these products to sell them on the streets of Australia.
Others say that the laws have increased their work.
A little family company of Zico Importy Pty Ltd was a two months before the British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco in England, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco's high courts.
She's saying Zico was selling over 6,000 in the trade, and he's waiting for a new stack.
That's a good job for us.
Experts say that the potansial disappearance is a democracy in the democracy of social media.
A series of Australia law banned television and sports, and many sellers were asked to keep cigarettes from where they were seen.
Australia has banned the Internet companies and sites, but the sea isn't restricted.
Becky Freeman, an international researcher in Sydney University, said, "If you are in the principal physician and only this small window has been left to reveal your products, it's the place you need to be online."
Freeman's market has increased in social media studys, such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
We need to ask this Marlboro cigarette, is it really a civil citizen and a video shop, or is it in that?
British American Tobacco said that he was focusing on the new rules, far more than the currency of Australia.
Industried Ukraine, Honduras, and Dominik Republic, the country claims that nothing of the world’s World Tired Organization has been restricted unjustly.
A WTO's decision is in the middle of 2013.
He said that the government was making contact with other countries who thought of the same packets.
In 2001, the first country that forced the photos were in Canada.
These are now over 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
In England, New Zelanda, South Africa, and India, there are more serious laws.
Most people in Australia are arguing about cigarettes.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm not aware of them.
When he bought a piece of a piece of packet, he said, "Give a cigarette and put it over."
If it's true, there's only one reason to leave, and she's my little girl.
In the center of Sydney, James Yu, the King of the Phoenicians's center, said that the only packing of packets is hard to shoot the photos.
Yu said, "I'm not going to be freed by a prosecutor. Now he'll take four hours.
He said, "The charge was to be banned all, then, okay, we're done, we'll close the shop."
It's not bad for us to stay in a world that's always infected
I spent five hours in the air when we flyed at this feast of this Thanksgiving Day, and when we had to wait for another plane, I spent five hours in the airport.
So I had a lot of time to think about tiredness.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Even if the airplanes are so tough, such as books, magazines, and iPhones, I don't even tell you about trafficking.
But in some cases, some academis and experts, in some cases, get up.
They say it's normal for us and our kids.
He's trying to force his brain to go to interesting tangents and maybe it increases the creative.
And most of us have experience the benefits of getting tired because we're connected to the other screen.
So we should be hungry?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll be back to this.
First, I thought it's a new idea that it's going to be more busy than many people.
In Canada, Peter Toohey is not like a Greek and Roman history professor at the University of Calgary.
He said, "It's really a long time for you to be sick."
There's a Latin wall on the wall of Pompei's walls.
Then he's asking how he's getting tired.
It's the problem that this is defined in many ways, and he says, Ontario, the psychology at New York University in Canada, John D. Eastwood.
After looking at the research literalist, the idea was placed before a $100 person group of people, and the Professor Eastwood and the colleagues said that it's a "masting, but not to be satisfied."
He said that something separated from the cash, but he wanted to be.
He said he has nothing to do in guests.
He said, "It's a desperate motivation and time's slowness of time."
Depression can be a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood, it may be, but the people who are struggling are in a environment or world, but the depressed people view the problem as themselves.
Sometimes we think we're tough when we're trying to be a concentrationist.
Professor Eastwood and historians, published in September of September, a journal of Psychological Sciences of Science.
Some groups heard a high voice and no interesting television program in the room, others heard that it is very few, but the third group has never heard.
Those who heard the television are reported more frequently than the two groups, they were harder to get concentration, but they were not sure why they were.
One of the writers of the worker and Mark J. Fenske, who at the Guelph University of the University of the University of Ontario, said that the interest would be disturbed when you tried to focus on a hard or busy task.
On the other hand, when you read a bit of trouble, "It can help you to keep watching the bad tools in a museum."
Actually, the scorn and desperateness that often appears to be a sign of suffering can make people more vulnerable in physically compromising.
Professor Fenske said, "The children who have been allowed to move to move, they have learned more than the kids who are forced to move."
We're all experiencing trouble in some points, the flight's late, a monoton talker.
But some people tend to be more tighter than others.
In the 1980s, researchers have developed a "Accelerative Education" to help me measure this.
There are questions like "I have many things I'm supposed to have to do, and I have a lot of interesting areas, and I don't have time to do anything."
Scientist Stephen Vodanovich, a psychologist at West Florida University, said that researchers have found that more often than the girls, more and more in need of different customs.
But most of the teens are a peculiar group.
In 1991, Illinois made a diagnostic experiment at the University of the University of the University of the University of Reed Larson, nearly 400 genders and parents, a call device, seven times a day.
He found that 32 percent of the Ergens were stumbling at school and paying, but when they weren't 23 percent of school.
On the other side, they said the parents were stabbed three percent.
Professor Larson said that 21 years later, they don't know if their stupid percent will be higher or lower.
But he said that it wasn't checked on the things he wanted to do, so he knew that it's the time of grieving.
That's why I'm back to my first question: Is it better for the man to be exhausted?
Sometimes no, because research shows that people can get into physical dangers, journal games, or the use of material.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who has been working over two more than two, said, many philosopher and writers are disputing the connection between the creative and creative.
Gary Marcus, a psychology professor in N.U., said, "The way your brain says you should do something else."
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you're swiming and using this energy to play the guitar and to eat, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it'll make you happy at a short time, but it won't be long.
So if you give him a iPad, he can't be tired, but he doesn't learn to be fun or to organize himself.
And he said, "It's a way of order to transfer himself to the other condition."
Your child doesn't just learn to make himself fun, and he's more self - control in other areas.
I don't think we'd really want to be tired.
We should not be so criticized.
Instead, our goal should be to be calm away from the interference and technology.
Professor has joined Eastwood.
He said, "We need to be more tired, but it's the desire to be incompatible with something unfortunate."
He said that what people really were looking for is a way to get out of the frog and enjoy the pleasure of the time.
He said, "It's hard to find the way for us to be busy in a neighborhood that we are being warned very much."
No Senaryo for New Marihuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a district university student in 19 east of Colorado, and the football player, has to be accused of something that will be legal in the country.
One day in September, Mr. Orosco and his friends were stopped at Lamar, while they were running the car in the nearest part of the Kansas border.
When the police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco everybody was called for $100 $100 dollars, movement and drugs, and the court case was given.
He said, "We were treated like a criminal."
But is he like that?
The answer of Colorado's insignificance of marijuana in a small number of weeks of unfamiliar drug cases is more dependent than the law.
Hundreds of hundreds of subtle criminal marijuana has already been shutdown in Washington, which confirms a similar caution.
When the police were 21-year-old and adults in the next weeks, they stopped registering the case of the law, which will be legally approved.
But in Colorado, more civil warriors have vowed to keep marijuana's case firm, and they're still calling people to the court for moving.
Also, a few towns from Denver to West Mountains are used to prevent marijuana's tickets from the new country.
Aurora's police officer in the east of Denver, Daniel J. Oates said, "This is so fast, and I don't know what will happen next."
And the editors in Washington Eyalet are in their heads.
And the last history, on December 1, 2013, they are looking for direction to build a license system, distributed, and selling.
Colorado's first use of medical medicine, and now they say it's in front of the country for a purpose in recreation.
The Washington Obalege, professor Brian E. Smith said, "Courado has more regular piano, so they will be a good guide."
But Mr. Smith went on to say that no place or system can do more than predict what's going to be done.
He said, "There's no real example for us to hear."
The law of Washington's I-502 will be applied on December 6, and the country will leave an uncertain year that will not exist but will be a legal movement.
In this period, there are a hard mechanical questions to solve, like the limits of the schools, parks, children, or child care center of the curiosity center of the capital marijuana in 10,000 feet [1,000 feet].
The newly established research group is Ben Livingston, a Russian Center of Livingston said, “It doesn't seem to be more difficult to find a license in any place, especially the city of Seattle is a big city. ”
In Aurora, 21 November, he sent a e-mail to the office officers in Aurora, who said that the city lawyer will not intervene for 21 years of age, and that the police would leave people to be accused of these crimes.
The Chief Oates said that the city law was going to be reared by the medicine marijuana, and they're going to follow their drugs and sellers again.
In the northern Colorado's Wedland, Ken Buck represents a more serious view.
The office said that it would continue to keep on watching marijuana's cases to force the users to heal mostly.
There are many other accusations that many of the 119 people are charged to carry twos or less or less marijuana.
Mr. Buck said, "We have the force to interrogate criminals when our office occurs."
The answer was even in some areas, such as Marihuana, refusing to the marijuana.
The cops at Grand Junction in the largest city of the country are no longer in case of adults.
The district administrator of the region, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but he decided not to shut down the ship cases.
He said, "I don't think I'm spending my time with the law until I continue to apply it."
If the voyages at Colorado were supporting 55 percent of the voyages, but it would never be easy to put the leisure marijuana into the government and legal system.
And the racial reactions in the country reveal a deep hybrid between the local authorities.
The local speaker Sean McAllister says that this is “a minor bari. ”
He said, "They have spent most of their lives in judging, so they still don't admit that it is legal."
For the first parts of the marijuana, the first parts of the rihuana are ready for the national tests of the Colorado and Washington in order to disturb drugs.
The lawyer and government are also waiting for the direction of the federal government, who plans to sell the marijuana and to get to the federal crime.
The lawyers of the legal marihuana hope to be restored to the Righteous Court of Justice.
Despite medicine marijuana, the Federal government has allowed them to work in the Colorado, Washington, and the next 16 countries.
In Obama's government, an old drug politician Kevin A. Sabet said that they will not be able to drown the doors to catch a little drug trainer, but it is possible to prevent them from allowing the funeral markets for a new law.
Some cities in Colorado don't expect the federal authorities to move.
Even before the choice day, some local governments agreed to postpone their new marijuana stores.
The last week, Montrose was banned for six months in West, and it is possible to be accepted next week.
Bob Nicholson, a member of the city, said, "We don't want this to be a big federal problem."
Our region used a vote against change.
We're looking at the area playing against the state's playing.
There's a lot of questions.

I was just judged for one reason, and this was a shift and bar: my dad, Woodrow Wyatt, Margaret Bucher's high profile, and I supported the Muhafazakars.
You can ask why I opened this.

Could I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Should I have to meet those who have the same ideas just when they're dark?
Would I go back to a business party and stop my natural tendencies?
For three years before me, it was like a prisoner and loneliness.
The only open recorder in my university was Norman Stone, the Modern History Professor of the University.

I'm tired of my emotional strength when I'm often visiting London.

We'll discuss these books that will continue in the letter sections.
In our letters, you can find answers to all the questions about the mammaling.
You can send your questions that you don't find the answer and specificly care about you.com.tr.
I'm gonna be very busy to answer you at a short time.
What's the business?
MALULEN is an extraordinary workman who is at least 60 percent lost and cannot be able to kill the SSK and the Councils of the SGK in order to kill their lives.
And when they have lost the strength to get their jobs from the highest positions, they are still able to do so.
Who's counting?
I'm writing from Diyarbakir, my name is Mehmet Gultenn, I have 920 days and I've got a 920 days and I've got 1460 days with my military debt.
Besides, I'm a bribe disease.
I'm connecting to the diyalis machine.
I'm working at a job.
Can I get a fortune?
- Mehmet Bey's first.
You didn't tell me the first time you've been in your business.
But let's tell you a short time about how the wealthy month will be tied up.
First of all, the most important conditions given by the law has to be insignificated for ten years and 1800 days of your prime day.
Also, when SGK's health is established, you are counted as well as when you have lost at least 60 percent of the power to get a business accident or the result of a business accident.
But you've got 60 percent of your diagnosies here because you're a diagnosed disease, so you can't have a monthly supplied because you haven't filled the count of 1800 primarily.
Of course we don't know how many years you've been working.
On the day you finish the 10 years and 1800 days together, SGK will be a monthly linked to you as you go out of your work.
It's possible to pay for money.
Cann't there be a ten years of complication, who's not 1800 days?
- 1800 days, the principal line must be complete.
But there is only one strategy, and for those who decide to be independent of someone’s need of material possessions, it's compensated with the fact that the other conditions are insignificant, without searching for ten years.
What diseases or diseases will be discussed in the advanced sections of our writings about the need for regular care.
The condition of the victims before they start working
I'm Ahmet Guler.
While I've been carrying all the conditions in the SGK law, they said to me, you can't get a casual month before I first got a job.
I'm very innocent.
Isn't it wrong?
How would I work?
- Ahmet Bey, you wrote all the conditions that you made in the Law, but it doesn't have to be available before the conditions of the capital of SSSK and Committee of the law.
Because you're not moving this condition, it can't be connected with the magnificent month.
But when you have an age insignificant injury, you may be retired.
- I have 3980 days, and I've been insignificant for 16 years.
It was identified by SGK before my money went.
They said, "You can't be a merchant.
I'll do what to do in this case.
I'm not gonna work.
Can you show me the way?
- Yeah, you heard the truth.
You can't work out.
But in the SGK law, there's a register for you.
Well, there's two things before October 2008 and later.
If you first started working before this, SGK can take a few months of age and the number of 3600 primarily insignificant years before you work.
That's why we recommend you to be on the mount of a monthly intervention by consulting the nearest SGK manager.
And if you went to work after 2008, you might have been able to get a month of age for the at least 15 years, and the at least 3960 days of magnificence, old age, and death.
Is it necessary to leave the job when it's up?
I'm working as a driver at a job job.
When I went to the hospital, she's got me a cancer known.
I want to be a lab.
Should I leave the job in this case?
Can't I get to the accommodations?
I don't want to be without work until the month's tiny.
- You heard the right thing.
You have to leave the job to give a monthly constitution.
But before the month intervention, you need to be counted by the SGK law.
But if you are in need of wealth, it will be a monthly convenient for you.
It doesn't mean to give a monthly binding, you have the risk of losing a job.
That's enough for you to have 1800 days.
When you go to SGK and make a request to identify my possessions, SGK will send you to one of the hospitals.
And when you bring the SGK report you're taking from here, you will find it in SGK in his own health code, and if you decide that your cancer's power is over 60 percent of your work.
But if you have to fill the ten years of the insurance of the month, you may be able to have a monthly breaking.
I mean, it's not unreasonable to make the SGK health Committee's decision.
But if the insistent influentials are not working at all conditions, the SGK asks for the defense of the financial condition and the monthly connection.
If this happens and other conditions are influential, it may be useful for him to start a few months later.
Is the link payment payable?
I'm an insurance.
I'm carrying all the conditions.
But they said, "You will not be a contract for the man who has a debt.
What should I do?
- I'm worth it.
Anyone who told you was right.
You didn't write what other conditions are, but if you think you're carrying these conditions, it's the law to pay your debt.
But I can give you a special tiyo.
I advise you to pay your debts by using banks or similar institutions.
How early it takes so many months, and you'll pay your debt at first.
These organs will be easy for you to pay for what they have done in your month.
What strategy's the magnificent month?
And I worked as a SSSK and the Common Sand.
How's it gonna be a month to me when I deserve the month?
And if you work for more than one statutes, more than a few statutes, you've been working in a statue, you're at the end of the magnificence. So if you're the last of the SSS, you'll get out of the work, and you'll take a month from SSS.
SGK reports of the patient
How's it done for a wealthy investigation?
Which hospitals can I get a health report?
It's enough for you to contact social security managers or social security centers for health reports.
SGK will send you to the military hospitals, except the university and the University hospitals (now university and vacational), who are inclined to Turkish capitals.
But if you're not available in your country, the health care can also be sent to the full-prepared hospitals.
It's not possible to move to a special hospital, right?
- It's only possible.
In the past arrangements, you've got a health report that you've been able to be a specially cared and risked in life to be able to have a love for the health career, the new director to the SGK, which will be in effect with the new administration that will be taken to the SGK, and it will also be considered to be made to a special hospital that can be cured by the risk of life to the risk of life.
What conditions are called for love processes?
The SEVK procedure is enough to be a primin 1800 days in order to determine the condition of the financial condition.
The curiosity expenses to the patient will be paid by SGK.
And it will not be searched for ten years of insurance, SGK looks at this.
If the mall is connected with the summer's summer's suitcase, a monthly summer is connected by a depositing ten years of incidents between the insurance conditions, only 1800 days.
So when a person first arrives to recognize his malignity, SGK comes to see the need for the need to be able to provide, only 1800 days.

Building sound frequency
I was surprised to tell the first sound engineers of Turkey about what they could do with the Swedish Pir frequency.
When sound technology or sound engineering, everybody's thinking about music.
And if you knew that the terrorism can be hindered with sound technology, could be perfect murdered by the frequency, you could put anyone in love, you could confess a secret to yourself, or you could comply with the world ritm?
When Pamir finished his inner Mimari University, Bilkent University, he took a audio engineer at SAE in England, and he took over the sound technology in Middlesex University.
The Communication of the boy's child's Galatasaray is developing a sound engineer in the Technological Academy ITM, and he is teaching the music technology, a project technology, electronic music, and previous recording.
Translate Subpriseal Message
"What's the sound technology full?" I'm the first question.
"A technology that can be used in many areas in the world.
Our brain recognizes everything with electricity.
The sound frequency is a type of electricity, energy.
By using this energy, you can change people's algs, and you can move on with the command you want."
One of the most important substances of sound technology.
The music or song is placed in a frequency of a frekans, which is not identified by the high memory, but it goes to the underlying memory.
For example, Pamir said that when a terrorist attacked attacks, he could make a music book in that area.
If the frequency of the printed song has been changed, a message like "Don't hit this attack" will be noticed by terrorist altogether.
He doesn't understand what he's hearing, but the submemoration knows it, and a voice comes out to him as if he called him "appma".
He sees it as a message from God.
But in the world and in Turkey, these messages are definitely banned and punishment.
And the summer is a substitute message that has been prepared to tell the students about the subject at the Stanbul Technical university.
"I listened to the students during the conference.
I put a frequency called "Suuu" in the music.
At the end of the presentation, I asked the students that they couldn't be silent.
They said they were so thirsty."
Pamir said that there are those who run as the submiliminal message, and "The radio channels are recognized that they have done this on our north, but the details are not yet known.
In Germany, there is a channel called "Kara Sesin Radyosu", a radian professor.
In sublimeal methods, religious contracts, war calls, biding drugs.
The German cops know that, and the Turk cops know it, but they can't be able to do that.
Also, these dangerous messages were used in the music world.
Especially in the songs of some heavy metal groups...
According to these claims, there was even a terrorist in the cycles, and the attack was performed by the subliminal commands that call the capital pilots to the substantine.
A Serious Water
Sound technology can also be used in crime.
In the United States, it's especially used in the banks.
For example, when the police came to the phone call, the sound engineers can determine where the man is in the phone, where he is in the bank.
It's different when a sound is hit, a statue, a plastica, a wall, or any other thing.
It is possible to recognize the largeness of the room, which it is in an inflame form of the room, and to describe how many points the room is.
Hence, it is possible to determine what kind of things the criminal has in the voice of the criminal is in a room.
And there was a computer program that was used for that, and I even made a opera building from Tataristan, and I calculated where the 175 hoparller could be placed in the building.
It's not a purchased technology, it's the value of 4-5,000 dollars."
The sound frequency is also used in the mimetric and decoratation.
Pamir has a lot of work to do with this.
For example, a restaurant in the ranks of the employees, where the highest ranks were held, he made a plan that could not go out of the meeting table.
He can only hear the talk in the table.
Two steps can't hear anything else at the table.
And the global model system of these planets says: “If you want to destroy a sound, you can mix it with another frequency of your molecular molecule structure, and you're going to turn it into a minimum and destroy the current sound energy.
Nobody would have been on the plane if this system wasn't already.
Because the sound of the plane engine is so higher than it can't endure.
These sounds in the plane are shooting each other and destroying themselves.
Even if your windows are open with this system, you can create a peaceful environment far away from your home."
Did Egypt pramits sound?
There are other interesting things he did, the first sound engineers of Turkey.
For example, he made a open air disk that couldn't hear the music voice from outside.
The sound can't go beyond the display border, comparing with another sound frequency.
If you want, it can be silent after a certain line in a room.
He also made the sporting room for a colleague and a concert.
I mean, it's used.
Because when you play basketball, you need a side, but the concert doesn't need to be a side.
And in the openhava concerts, it's possible to make a sound quality of music only listenable.
"We use frequencys to destroy the voices that have been recognitioned by a voice, correcting the man's lips, and to make music more clear.
MTV's too far on this.
The openhava consoles, and they hear the studio record of the sound.
That's the tbitaker's experiment.
Drop the two albums between the sound frequency.
There were scientists who claimed that the Egyptian pratrices were done with sound.
They thought the thrones could be removed with sound.
I'm asking, "Aren't it easy to use bad motives?"
"When I read the University of Zaten New York, I was very scared to read it from the Internet, or others would read it.
'Cause it's said, even those who are good intentionally tried to be tried except the laborator conditions.'
"Extensive in the Arabic."
Sudan Pamir says that the dishonest dishonesty would affect the humanity of the world, and he explains why he says: “Because all the sounds that your ears hear are sent to the brain.
Of course, the human hears the voice that is the only concentration, but the other sounds send to the brain, actually, and it leads to tiredness.
That's why you need to free your brain, so it's good to walk in the dust and make natural walks.
I think there should be orders for the sound in school.
That's why the student's only in the voice of the teacher, and he can take a long time in consistence."
Pamir notes that the prayers have a lot of wealthy frequency in Arabic because of the characteristics of the sound frequency of the sound frequency.
He says, "I need to read your prayers loudly, but when I read the truth, I think I'm insulted."
Love sequence of frequences
"Is it possible to love a person with sound frequency?"
And the frequency description of Pamir that he gave is that you need to find the pressures that you want to love first.
You can affect him by using a higher frequency than this frequency.
For example, think of a man who has 300 scores.
And you want to play a music that comforts her while she is with her.
If you sing about 300 frequencys on your music, the power of those who have the power of the frequency and make the two-numbered ones, it's the power of the person.
Maybe it might be a love for someone who is at that moment."
Pamir, who speaks of a special sound system that is more effective in the world, can also feel the politician as a very powerful, stadium artist.
And the answer of Pamir said: "The sound is near the voice of man because the most touching voice is near at his voice.
For example, what is a beautiful tool, like a human being's breathed."
"The gold prices will be upper."
Canada Jennings Capital Inc. The Analist Dan Hrushewsky said that the government’s expensive efforts to reduce the value of the money, so he said, "The gold will continue to be a safe tool."

Remembering that India was the biggest gold peers, Hrushewsky, "I believe they're trying to manage car accounts now not.
People will find a way in this frame."
Hrushewsky suggests that they should make a long vacations under the purchase, and he continues to serve as a safe tool.
Many Western governments are forgotten by the influential influential levels of payment.
The governments are trying to reduce their debt by reducing the value of money units.
That's why the gold prices will come up from the current level.
"In the end, the gold, the piano's ability to heal their risks."
And the World Council of the World Council, Marcus Grub, says a physical person who offers a simple, volatile piano, cheffaf, and reliable features of physician physician piano.
The golden portphs of small numbers have proved that it's more stable and more stable that it's better to cope with the unforeseen occurrence."
Grub points out that the gold graduation of the order in the last 10 years, "Stay, in less than 1 percent of the world’s financial resources.
This means that piano's yet important opportunities to grow up in the gold collaboration.
In this sperm, it's an estimated evidence that the 78 percent of 78 percent of fluids of gold and skekeptics are protected by the investor's interest under the electricity.
"Hindistan must increase national gold statues to support the financial advancement."
The biggest gold physician of the world also answers to India and China, Grub said that the second figs of gold in the year were encouraged by the tale of gold and gold and skekeptics, and that it increased the harvest work in Asia.
Grub reminds me that in the period, there's 54 percent of the celebration in China, and in India, 51 percent.
Grub said that if there was a high trend, the Chinese purchases would usually be silent in the second half of the way.
Then, on April, the gold prices of gold falled unexpectedly, and the dumps of the sands were ran out quickly."
In Grub, in India, the government has taken a lot of preparation in order to support the corresponding rubies and to reduce the taxes, and this is why the government can meet the channels.
The World Council believes that the India should view the politics as a strategy.
And they also found that the long-time politician has to add up national gold statues to support financial advancement.

The records of students read in normal average, and they were new as a college student
MEB, after 4+4+4, all the first schools in Turkey were formed as a medicine, medium, and colleague.
After the 1-year-year-old training, it became evident that a multitude of school collapsed with a new skanda signed by a new scan.
In Turkey this year, all schools that were transmitted to the center of all the schools in Turkey, the Skanner Center of the Memory, and the transfiguration in the Meramoou.
A year's normal center.
In the past year after 4+4+4, the graduate school was transmitted to the center of the school.
In school, the first school was graduated with three and 4, class 6, 7, and 8.
For one year, the school served as a normal center, with the end of 2012-2013 training year of training.
The graduated school accepted five classes for the first time in this year as a "friend" in school.

"In another school that you don't want."
The captains who learned the situation, came to school, complained about the situation.
But the school government said to the colleagues: "The colleagues who don't want their kids to continue in the colleague."
In the Council of the Il National Education, the concept of the Common Education has a interesting expression.
In the description, we were able to translate some schools by paying attention to students and school numbers of schools, and in this colleague, 15-20 schools were transmitted.
The schools enter the e-read system with school codes.
But when the school is transmitted, the old school code is removed from the system.
The new school code has to be performed by the system of disciples.
These schools were transmitted by the New Organization Code to college, in order that the students may not be dishonored by the types of schools and teachers.
It was said, "The requesters will take their children's queens from these schools and give them to other schools."
