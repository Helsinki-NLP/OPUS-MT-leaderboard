He's not a good dinner.
Tom said he wasn't in any emergency.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you weren't Candy.
Come to watch us music for some time.
Tom said he understands why Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said she was very busy to help you do this today.
Tom told me he'd be complaining about it.
Tom's a member of my housing co-op.
Tom went down the street where Mary lives and hoped to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know, and I don't have any chance to Tom will do that.
Tom wasn't sure he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know Tom's supposed to do this by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to do.
It would have been tired to do that.
Tom had to tell us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should do that.
We have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said she didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.
Tom knew he would be punished.
I don't think I never saw anyone doing that before.
That's not hard.
I'm afraid we haven't left.
Tom told me how to play the drums.
We haven't succeeded yet.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he didn't eat anything, but it wasn't true.
I'm a atheist.
Tom said Mary was at home with a cold.
I wonder if Tom really thought it was a good idea to do it.
Tom said she knew she had to do this on her own.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was puzzled.
Tom said he'd be glad to do that for you.
Tom said I looked at a little pale.
Tom told Mary that she should quit being confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom is hiding something from me.
Did you know Tom didn't play the guitar until he was 30 years old?
I wonder if Tom knows if Mary wants to do that.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.
I know Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why are everybody looking at us?
I know Tom didn't know who did that to Mary.
I thought Tom did that because everyone in his family did it.
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe.
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you would like to do that.
Tom didn't talk to Mary yet.
I don't think Tom's beautiful.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
I should never let you go home alone last night.
I think I'll have a chance to do that tomorrow.
Tom said you were really good in tennis.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was an autist.
Tom would have wanted to go to Boston with you.
I know Tom is more creative than Mary.
I know Tom is more creative than I am.
Tom said he doesn't want to know why we did that.
I think you'd all agree that Tom is one of our best magnificents.
Tom said he was depressed.
Tom said I don't have to do this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom shouldn't have left early.
She's already married.
That's a blasphemy!
Tom said she thought she wasn't awake.
Tom said he was happy to do that.
You can't buy one of those who's less than sixty dollars.
Do you think Tom would like to go to Australia with us?
Tom said he likes dance with Mary.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that.
Tom must have seen us doing that.
I'm sure Tom will run for the president.
Tom had to do this yesterday.
Tom may be angry.
Tom said Mary won't be mad.
I knew Tom wanted us to do that for him.
Tom said he didn't live in Australia anymore.
I know Tom knew he didn't need to do that.
I hope I didn't forget anyone.
Tom said she knew she shouldn't do that.
I didn't think Tom would be so angry.
I thought you liked romance novels.
I'm not sure Tom and Mary are stubborn.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anybody who hates Tom.
Tom said he thought I could win.
Three years ago, I was in Boston.
I don't think I can do what Tom is doing.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
Riches don't interest me.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
Tom said he had no idea to leave early.
It's not for the starters.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were depressed.
I think Tom doesn't know how to move.
Tom has a lot of friends here.
Tom knows he's cheated.
I think Tom was a member of our club.
Where's your notebook?
I don't think I'd be early tomorrow as I'm today.
It doesn't seem to be that Tom will always admit that she's wrong.
How many kilometers are from here to the trilroad station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopts the behavior and speech patterns that are useful.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking about having dinner in six.
Tom told Mary that she would do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's over.
Tom said Mary's dog was biting him.
Tom said he was doing that.
Tom said he's intriguing his suspicion.
He's very close to her.
I thought you would show me how to do that.
I'm telling you I have to think Tom is dead.
Mary has a hairdresser's appointment.
Tom told Mary that she might be allowed to do this today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone's smelling a smell in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that question is not appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a child?
I don't think nobody noticed what we're doing.
What are we gonna do?
I could cry.
There's no free dinner.
I thought you said we're not going to go with Boston Tom.
Tom's stopping smoking.
I think I know what Tom's doing here.
Tom and Mary said they'd be glad to help.
I'm sure that's not going to happen now.
They're not as fussy as they were.
We're going to school every day except Sundays.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't hungry.
Tom thought she wouldn't survive.

Tom thinks I need to go.
Tom told everyone he didn't understand French.

I turned the lights away.
He's a shopping addict.
Tom said Mary was going home to Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't sleeping.
Tom thought Mary was listening, but she wasn't.
I thought you said Tom was a barber.
I wonder if this really works.
Let's go to the point.
Did you give Tom the key?
Tom wasn't surprised when Mary told him to do that.
My father is a doctor.
I don't think I'd like to marry Tom.
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Tom often do this by himself.
I learned a lot from this conversation.
I thought Tom would buy that car.

I know Tom doesn't know Mary needs to do that.
Everybody's here except Tom and Mary did it.
Tom told me she thought she was satisfied.
Tom said he's gonna help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut the captain for the guests.
I know Tom doesn't know he doesn't really have to do that.
I think Tom's gonna understand that.
I didn't decide yet.
I know that isn't worth it.
Tom told me he thought Mary was insulted.
It's not wrong.
Tom and Mary told me that they were offended.

Nobody laughed at Tom's joke.

We're planning to go tomorrow.
Well, I think Tom's snorcher than Mary.
What are you trying to do?
We didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
You'd better take your shoes off.
I didn't think we did anything wrong.
Everybody knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom's already decided he's going to sign the agreement.
Is it true that you were there?
What do you think Tom would have done?
They say they're not coming.

I'm hoping Tom's crying right now.
You're really an angel!

It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that by himself.
I was so excited!
Tom is a party animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom's gonna have to do that today.
I hope I don't need to do that.
Tom must have changed a lot.
Nobody's better than me.
Before I saw Tom, I could tell him he was angry.
I know Tom knows he shouldn't do that here.
He's here.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is now.

I didn't know you were doing that by 2:30.
Tom said he'd be in the next month.
I wish I was on your side!
Get your paws out of me.
I'm afraid I have to refuse.
I know you're just retired.
I knew Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder if we'll really do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should've just walked down.
I don't think you're listening to me.
We're brothers and sisters.
I don't think Tom's finished.
I don't think we've done anything wrong.
I don't think I never saw anyone trying to try it before.
Didn't you have any television?
Don't give up!
I'm not playing the mandolin as well as you.

I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
It's the feeling.

I should have written it down.
I'm not hungry anymore.
You can do it.
Tom likes to keep things up to himself.
I don't think everyone's left.
I thought you believed Tom to help us.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to Tom's funeral.
I'm so happy.
I know Tom's gonna do that today.
I know some of your students don't like you.
Kyoko had a kindness to carry my baggage for me.
Tom told me she thought Mary was hurt.
Tom said she knew that she shouldn't have to do that.
It doesn't seem to be rain tomorrow.
I didn't know you were planning to do that next winter.
I don't know what that means.
I think it's more important to discuss possible solutions.
I didn't realize both Tom and Mary should do that.
Tom and Mary's both stuck?
It's the time Tom promised him to be here.

Tom won't admit she was wrong.
Sorry, but I can't do that.

Tom told me she was psychized.
We should have brought lunch.
In most lands, the heading brand of pop drink is Coca-Cola.

They thought they could do that.
I wonder if I can do that again.
I feel depressed often.

Tom said he thought he had to do that.
I wonder if Tom already did that.
You should have eaten some cake.
Tom said he doesn't think you need to do that.
Tom and Mary think they have a flu.
Who told you that we should do that?
Tom said she just did that once.
I knew Tom wasn't a very nice guy.

What's cooking in the mutchen?
I'm grateful for your help.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interested in doing that.

They're hiding.

I'm tired of homework.
I don't think I'll dance with Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I didn't start studying French until I was 30 years old.

It should have been easy to accomplish.

You don't need to be here any longer.

Whatever Tom says, I'm planning to do it.
I'm proud of you.
It was clear that Tom wanted to do that last day.

Now we know that's not true.

Unfortunately, Apple doesn't give me a warrant for the predicamental damage.

Don't talk to nonsense!
Tom said Mary wasn't scared.
I should have helped you to do that.
Tom said she would give Mary a book.
I think Tom could be better singing the country music than anyone else I know.
Both Tom and Mary saw you.
Tom thinks Mary will be able to convince John to do that.
I don't know if Tom works or not.
There's no question about it.
Nobody can handle the problem.
I'm not gonna talk to him anymore.
I think Tom's gonna do that too.
I shouldn't have allowed you to do that.
I've already met everyone.
Tom said Mary would do that too.
Tom said he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they wouldn't wait.
I don't believe I should do that.

I didn't know you're gonna let Tom do that by himself.
I know Tom might want to do that.
Tom said she didn't look like Mary was enjoying herself.

It's a dead poison!
They know they're watching.
Tom told me that she thought Mary could speak French.
Tom might be sleeping.
I know Tom's not a very good manager.
I don't care if you do it.
It's not rocket science.
Tom said he wanted to help us.
There's someone waiting for you.
They said they were ready.
Tom and Mary said they felt light.
You know you shouldn't do that, don't you?
Nothing's done.
Let's make sure that's not happening.
I know why Tom can't do that for him.
Tom said he thought it could be in Boston, too.
I didn't know Tom was an acom.
I think Tom would like to be the next one to do that.
Tom said I was the one with the problem.
You don't expect to do that, are you?
If it's good tomorrow, we'll break the mountain.
Nobody told Tom what to do.
Have you ever hit someone?
I don't think Tom was mad.
I knew Tom knew how to do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were healthy.
I think that's wrong.
There's a place for everything.
Tom said he wouldn't be allowed to do that anymore.
I told Tom you were hungry.
Tom's very sure he saw a wolf.
I don't think it's your decision.
I thought you were retired.

I didn't think you would do it by yourself.
I don't think we have enough food to feed everyone.
I know Tom's not a bad person.
It's said he knows the secret.
I think Tom would be a good room friend.
Tom said she thought she was supposed to do that.
I know Tom didn't know who did that for him.
Tom said he was good.
Why didn't you tell me you didn't want my help?
Tom said he didn't think he could do this today.
I just want you to consider the possibility you're wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said she was supposed to do it next time.
I'm happy as possible.
If they knew what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans.
I know Tom didn't know he didn't want to do that.
Tom is rich, but he's not as much as Mary.
Go wake up and tell him that the breakfast is ready.
Tom was surprised that Mary was still up.
I should have left early.
Tom said she knew that she shouldn't have to do that by herself.
Tom said his failure was due to bad luck.
I didn't think Tom would be alone.
Tom said he's not trying to buy anything.
She has to be taken to hospital.
Things didn't go on the way I hoped.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't get there until dark.
Tom said she knew she wanted to do that again.
I know Tom's careless.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to go with him to Australia.
The bus arrived ten minutes later.
Tom isn't home right now.
Tom said he likes shit, too.
I don't think there's no point to discussing this matter with you.
I think you shouldn't do that by yourself.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't want to do that until it gets cooler.
I didn't think Tom was curious.
Tom said he didn't know Mary did that.
Tom said he's faster than Mary.
Tom and Mary told me that they were hot.
I didn't know Tom had to do that by himself.
We're divided by three of the loots.
I don't think Tom could do it by himself.
Tom told me I was good.
What time is the display starting?
Tom knows she needs to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom's probably not going to joke with Mary.
I don't think Tom knows who's doing this to Mary.
Three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said he didn't know if he could do that.
I know Tom wasn't able to do that.
Keep on the next tracks.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're alone.
Did you fear the first time you were in airplane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs apologize.
I'm disappointed with my son.
I don't think I did so well.
Do you think you have a chance to do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There's a big supermartic.
I was suspicious, Tom.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said he knew that Mary would not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure nobody can see us?
There's no solutions for this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I was suspicious, Tom couldn't have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Did he touch you?
Tom and Mary said they'd do that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today is the twenty of October.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary isn't Canadian.
Africa isn't a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me that he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have children.
I know Tom forgot that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book isn't so interesting.
I was told that it's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team will continue to improve.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom, of course, knows he shouldn't do that.
Tom don't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn yourself into it.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
Nobody knows I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said she was supposed to do it next time.
I knew Tom was the one to tell Mary that she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I should do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they didn't come back.
Tom doesn't know Mary's love for someone else.
I don't think Tom's worrying.
I wish I had the opportunity to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom was going to be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in prison.
Tom said she thought she couldn't do that by herself.
Tom said he wouldn't win.
It may be Tom may not know I'm here.
Do you think I'm strange?
Tom thinks he knows it all.
Tom said it wouldn't be fine.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do this today.
I thought we had something to give Tom.
The puppies did the work.
Tom and Mary said they didn't think of it.
You'll stay here until you are invited.
My daughter is trained toilet.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could do that.
Tom and Mary told me that they were good.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
Nobody suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said he shouldn't say what he shouldn't say.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they never met you.
I think Tom is a very good painter.
I know Tom's a cheap and a little new thing.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
I'm sure Tom knows Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know Tom knows how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still getting away.
You're a nervous.
Everybody was late except me.
He couldn't resist temptation.
Tom may be angry if you do that.
I thought Tom would agree.
I'm a Libertarian.
Can I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I never met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do this today.
I don't think Tom would have to do that alone.
She wants to know who the flowers sent.
My hearing isn't as good as it was.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admits that he was insulted.
You'll have a hard time.
I should let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know Tom is a little older than Mary.
Tom didn't know someone had been sold to kill him.
Tom told me he couldn't eat the peanuts.
I don't think Tom would like to do that.
Tom said he thought I wouldn't have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me that he thought he could do that.
Tom said Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who was confused?
I know Tom's a horrible.
He's the most crazy boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me she thought she was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm sure it wasn't Tom.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary wasn't tired to her.
I'm sure Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning to go anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he never planned to live in Australia so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot of books than you do.
I know Tom is about the same height as you are.
There's no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put drugs in my bag.
Tom said she's glad she wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she could read the book that she'd lend him.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could have done it, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't yet told anyone they'd get married.
They said they planned to go Monday.
It's not easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me that they had bacon and eggs for dinner.
Tom didn't tell anyone that they should do that.
I think Tom's so much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worried.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose the weight.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was a copident.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do it without our help.
Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Did anybody have a hug Tom?
Tom told me she liked my idea.
I know you're just doing this to me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anybody afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything in his mind.
We married seven years ago.
I could do that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could do that better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
He's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary's better in French than her.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think Tom would do that?
That's his house.
I'm home.
You don't need to pay for your dinner.
Maybe I should try harder.
I thought Tom would do that today.
They promised they'd check it.
I'm sure Tom would agree.
Tom and Mary said they don't like that.
Tom said he knew he had to do this by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of taking it there.
Tom had to get a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think Tom has a chance to hurt.
Tom said he was glad you did that.
I always knew Tom was a troubler.
Well, I never!
Tom thinks Mary can't win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he thought she knew Mary knew what she was planning to do.
I wonder if Tom's really home.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well.
Tom said he thought Mary was good in French.
Tom says he'll always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as much as you do.
I wish I had someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know that I supported you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in serious danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom think?
I just had a bottle for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next journal.
Tom and Mary probably won't buy everything they need for 300 dollars.
They said they like this year.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
They say they did not agree with that deal.
I know Tom didn't know you can't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was kidnapped.
I know Tom is a really close friend of Mary.
I know Tom didn't know who to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom wouldn't do that?
I know Tom's going to agree with that.
Tom shut his computer off.
I don't think Tom knows how time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without help.
Tom and Mary say they don't really believe John's plans to do that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You don't really suggest that I go with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that soon as I needed it.
I don't think Tom is boss.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why he didn't do that.
I would have done it by myself if Tom didn't help me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that she didn't think John was hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me she thought she had done that.
Tom and Mary vowed that they would never hit me again.
Tom said he had to stay in Australia longer.
Tom told him that they couldn't allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do that.
I don't think I had to leave before Tom.
Tom said she wouldn't help her anymore.
That guy reminds me of someone I knew.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I already told Tom that I should do that.
I'm planning to stay home all day Monday.
I would like to do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could steal Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
Nobody's a controversy Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom's really amused by what's going on?
We haven't yet been fighting.
Who's shooting on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they were supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said is shocked to everybody.
Tom and Mary told me that they were ambitious.
Tom said he thought Mary was a mistake.
I hope nobody comes.
I thought everybody could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said he thought Mary was in his bedroom study.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me that it didn't matter.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I'd forget about it.
Tom told everyone he was doing that.
They thought there was no hope.
Tom said she didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were pleased.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little.
I know Tom's a lot more than me.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that happens.
I knew Tom wasn't busy.
I don't think I never saw Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is quicker than Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't supposed to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everybody has a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone's toothbrush.
Tom thinks she loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom can do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We've walked around the shadow.
I don't think it'll be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Sundays.
I don't think Tom's as rich as many people think he is.
You won't do anything like that.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been 30 years old today if he hadn't died last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom is safe.
I know Tom didn't know he shouldn't do that here.
Do Tom know you want a new computer?
I didn't do that yet.
Tom said he feels like that.
I don't understand how that could happen.
You're like my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom has already done enough.
Do you know anybody in Boston?
Tom said he was the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you would be happy to see me.
Tom admits that she was the one who thieved Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told to do that.
We're better telling others.
Why is everyone talking about Tom?
Federer held in love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them.
I know Tom could save a lot of time by doing it.
Tom said he was hoping that she and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that didn't make him angry.
When will he be finished?
You're a very fucking boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
There's a piece of plance with some pebbles in heaven.
Tom and Mary said they're planning to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that.
Who sends letters by mail?
If something sounds so good to be true, then it's probably probably.
Tom said you wouldn't want to do that.
Tom said he wasn't there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in a hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for a couple of weeks.
I hadn't planned to do that, but if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said she was expecting Mary to participate.
I'm swiming every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They said they didn't know me.
I know Tom's a little shorter than Mary.
Tom will do that if nobody stops him.
I'm sure Tom will not do that.
I'm sure you'll be successful.
You know, Tom and I'm not going to do that, don't you?
Tom and Mary told me that they finished it by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have left there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought you couldn't do that.
Tom said he had forgotten something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew who Tom needed to do this.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
This isn't a problem with the current technology.
They said they're trying to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office is French.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom should do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that.
I think you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was hot.
You have a sense of humour, I like that.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to talk.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you eat a omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
Nobody asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in the next spring of Boston.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk any more.
I wonder if we can do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom can do that.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Tom's got a girl who's three years older than he's.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't want to do that.
I know Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom will like this wine.
I believe we're talking about the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a lot of truth he says.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom's a slob.
He's not a viroto.
I doubt Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually do that.
Tom told me she'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't yet told Mary what to do.
I know Tom is a good diamond.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should stay home.
I don't think it's enough to feed us all.
He's not the sharp knife in the drawer.
Tom said he's planning to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends are not here.
A wolf can't be filled.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what to do.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I don't know I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't pay.
Are you worried about that?
I know Tom doesn't know Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll see it's done.
I'm wearing a suit, but I don't wear a tie.
I'm tired as you do.
Tom thought she could come down with a cold.
I think Tom hates me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're a lucky you didn't hurt.
Where are Tom and Mary planning to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to be mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
You sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary's always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't do.
Tom said she was worried about Mary.
We all got in the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do it or not.
I've been drowning last night.
Tom isn't so good at the bowling.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
Tom told me she thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you're paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You're both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom's actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he had a lot of food.
We're all waiting for your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that soon.
Have I ever told you about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was 30 years old.
Tom said he didn't want him to play with Mary.
I know Tom's gonna let you do that.
If I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew that she should not do this by himself.
I wonder if Tom's moved.
Tom said he would do that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you had to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like if Mary did that.
I still wish you would do that.
Let me tell me he's not planning to stay so long.
I didn't know you would be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait for that long.
I'm surprised you don't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom might be lonely.
Tom said she thought she wasn't busy.
I'm sure that's not going to happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary plans to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them.
You're so uncle.
I have already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You finished your homework, didn't you?
What could it have happened?
I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes him.
I lost in the forest.
I know Tom's a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'll be in Boston next Sunday.
Keep your mouth shut up!
Tom said he knew he had to do this on Monday.
Tom said he regretted what happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary that she had to do that.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
You got a pen on you?
Tom let Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents don't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time to do this for him.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn't you eat the food I had eaten?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried his father's clothes.
I'm sure Tom won't tell Mary why she did that.
Tom said he was trying to do that all weeks.
You have a really beautiful teeth!
Nobody knew that Tom was the man who gave most of the money.
Everybody knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was disappointed.
Tom and I were both confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that it was going to happen.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I agreed to do what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Did you know that Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a little problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's already done that.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should do that.
There must be a reason for Tom's not here.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me that she thought Mary could run more faster than she could.
Tom said Mary was scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know Tom is a farm, but I don't know where her farm is.
Tom says that the matter is getting tired.
Tom said Mary doesn't like that.
What's wrong?
No one could stop that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I'd do that, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom's overmost.
I'm in a littlepox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my coffee.
My class was canceled.
Tom and Mary told me that they were going to leave.
Tom promised me he would be here by 2:30.
Tom said she thought Mary could take care of herself.
It's not as cold as I expected it to be here.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'm alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to start.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I think Tom won't be surprised.
I know Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me that she thought she was jealous.
Anyone else knows you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I know Tom knew who to do this for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do it without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was troubled.
No one's back.
Tom said Mary would do that.
I met someone who knows we are.
Tom said he thought those shoes were so expensive.
Tom said he knew he shouldn't do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried about Tom's going to lose.
They told me they were next.
I'm sure Tom and Mary aren't eager to do that now as they're the day.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to say to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't tickling.
I know Tom did that to make Mary jealous.
I know you're more smart than that.
We're sorry for being unwilling.
That's not the main reason I want to do it.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm awful.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't do that.
Tom and Mary told me that they had a lot of food.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he had forgotten the door.
I know Tom's afraid people might laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was still mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.
Tom said she couldn't be sure Mary can't fly.
I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom is the only one to do that.
I didn't think you would win.
I don't think Tom will have time to do this with us today.
I know Tom's very thought.
We can't let these stars move us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew who Tom could do this and who couldn't do it.
Don't think they've ever met Tom and Mary.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everybody knows we're not eating pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't do that.
I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.
I already told Tom that I don't plan to do that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not good to eat food.
I'm glad to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I'm sure Tom and Mary are those who did that.
I'm sure I can sit here more than you can say.
It's not done yet.
I know Tom isn't on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
Tom just turned the radio.
Tom's already decided he's not going to say yes.
I know Tom is a bit smoking.
What's in the box?
Tom said she knew she wouldn't want to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would do it by himself if he could.
Prompting that there is a problem is the first step to handle the problem.
Mary said she was planning to go.
Tom told me she thought she would be away.
Tom said Mary was lying.
I don't think Tom would be disappointed if I did that.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't be there.
They said they thought I could win.
Tom means to everyone, isn't he?
Tom isn't really in Boston now.
I was hoping to get an e-mail from you today.
I thought Tom was suspended.
Tom isn't a suspect anymore.
There's nothing here.
I thought Tom didn't do that well.
I knew Tom would do that right now.
Why didn't you go to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to do that again.
Tom said that she was very happy.
I know Tom could get Mary to show us how to do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's gonna say yes.
I was afraid I might be late for the bus.
You're not allowed to bring dogs into this building.
Tom and Mary vowed that they wouldn't do that.
I know I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
You're welcome.
I couldn't believe it was too fast.
Do you think the good was right?
Do you think Tom will keep his promise?
I don't think there's no chance I can do that.
I know Tom is a rude.

I want to go and change that bought last night.

You're tired, aren't you?
Did Tom do that by himself?
Tom and Mary said they used to study French.

We are brothers.

It'll be difficult to find someone to replace Tom.

It's not easy to understand.

I thought you might want something cold to drink.
Tom told me he wouldn't go to Boston, unless I went with him.
Nobody saw them.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was sleeping.

I didn't know I was doing that wrong way.
That's the best thing anyone ever did for me.
Tom told Mary that she didn't think she was happy that John was going to happen.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would have come soon.

Tom said he thought he was so high on that store.
Tom said he didn't feel like eating.

I thought you said I could trust you.

I know I'm gonna regret that.
Tom thought Mary was stricken.
Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that.
Do you have any idea when Tom plans to get here?
I know you're not planning to stay in Boston.
I wonder if that could happen again.
I doubt Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't keep looking at it.
I think Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
The evidence now doesn't allow me to make such a claim.
Tom said he's very sure Mary had to do that.
Tom would have been happy if you did that.
Tom said he wanted to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom said he needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.
I could have stopped it.
It's not good to eat and run.
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven.
Tom said she was asked not to do that.
We're invited to dinner.

Tom thinks I miss a great opportunity.
I know Tom's not a very good guitar player.
Tom and I were both impressed.
Everybody knows Tom is lying.
They're not young as they say they are.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Did you know Tom wasn't trying to do that?
I never thought I would go there.
You know that's not true.
I know Tom and Mary have already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same.
Tom's probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom decided he's not going to work today.
Tom denied that she was the one who asked Mary to do that.
I wish I could speak French and Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It won't work.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said that Mary thought she wouldn't be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom and I told Mary that we should try to do this by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I couldn't do that without your help.
I knew Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.
Tom said he's waiting for his rent.
Whether we do this now or later, it doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should have imagined Tom wouldn't be with Mary.
I think it's very unlikely that Tom didn't know that she wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without her parents.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination for this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary doesn't plan to do that until I tell her.
I didn't know you had to do this morning.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
I didn't understand Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that can be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know Mary was living in Boston.
I didn't know you needed to do this today.
You should have sent your children a month ago.
I think that's not mine.
I believe Tom's 30 years old.
Think about it.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
I didn't think anyone would like Tom.
I thought Tom could be the only one who knew Mary was living.
I didn't think nobody ever did something like this before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to stay.
This isn't something I know how to do.
I think I can fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.
Tom said we'd lose.
Tom said he should do that.
You're sure Mary said she's planning to do that tomorrow?
There were times when I was lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was crazy.
Tom already knows Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I'm not going to tell anyone where you are.
It won't end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all the caves.
Tom's gonna be so happy he didn't do that.
I don't think Tom should do that alone.
If I were you, I would go home at once.
It's not like you know what they're gonna do.
Tom and I are planning to stay together.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
So what are you suggesting?
Tom said he learned a new thing.
I know Tom's married.
Tom said he thought the economy was in a bad shape.
I thought you were jury-in-lawed something.
I have been studying English for three years.
Tom's the only man I ever thought to marry.
I didn't think Tom would be awake when I got home.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was blazed.

It's not as difficult as sounds.

Tom said Mary was still lonely.
I didn't think Tom would be arrested.
Tom told Mary that she wasn't planning to join the team.
You promised not to be unkind to me anymore.
Tom thought it would take longer.
I wonder if Tom knew he needed to do that.
I think Tom's like that.
Tom had all kinds of problems.
I knew Tom would want you to do that for him.
I thought Tom would want to see this movie.
I think Tom is still inconvenient.
I'm Tom's dad.
I just want to tell you that you are the most beautiful woman I ever saw.
Tom said he would do his homework before dinner.
Tom looked at Mary and said nothing.
I wonder if Tom's really sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they want to die.
Tom said he had enough of that.
I'm sure Tom's on vacation.
Tom told me he was so tired to study tonight, so he just wanted to watch TV.
I don't think Tom is so bright.
Tom said he thought Mary had to do that before John came here.
It would have been easy to do that.
Tom said he thought he was supposed to do it by himself.
That's so good.
Tom says he wasn't the one who broke the window.
It was clear that Tom was going to do that.
They don't know they should do that.
The type we need is not always available.
I wouldn't like to talk about it.
I didn't think anyone saw us.
We can't turn back.
I know Tom knows we shouldn't do that.
You didn't know I had to do that, did you?
Tom wondered that it was too late to help Mary.
Tom and I both sit back.
Tom was wearing the tie that Mary gave him.
Tom and Mary said they were not alone.
The question is not so much as it looks like it looks like.
I know Tom's always right, but it's not this time.
Tom said that it wouldn't be dangerous.
You're my coro, Sami.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom said he felt insulted.
Tom knew Mary was going to win.
Tom and Mary said they don't want this.
It's not about them.
I thought you said you wanted to do it by yourself.
Tom had a key.
Tom knew there was a possibility that Mary would do that.
You're so nervous.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Canada.
Tom and Mary told me they were hungry.
It's not socially acceptable to people.
Tom would have let Mary do that.
I wish we stayed in Australia for another week.
Here's the map you were looking for.
I thought you would never do that again.
Tom knows why Mary's planning to go to Australia.
I wonder if we have to do that.
I know Tom will never forgive Mary for doing that.
This is the third time Tom did it this week.
I wonder if Tom and Mary will say something about what happened.
I know Tom doesn't know he's supposed to do this today.
Tom says everyone she knows can swim.
Tom said he had a shock on his truck.
It was clear that Tom liked to do it.
I don't think what I did was wrong.
I knew Tom was scared.
Tom said she wasn't planning to stay in Australia so long.
I thought I would find you here.
It's not clear who wrote this letter.
They must have been tired.
Tom's doing all right.
Tom said he didn't have to do that.
Tom said that Mary knew she would not want to do that until John had time to help him.
I didn't think Tom would like that.
I shouldn't have made you into this.
I think everyone trusts me.
I was surprised when Tom told me he wanted to do that.
I hope I'll see Tom tomorrow.
How much water does it fill your swimming pool?
Tom said Mary is still crazy.
Tom said he thought Mary would like to do that.
Tom said he would come, but he never came up.
I'm sure Tom has the courage to do what is really needed.
Tom says she doesn't believe Mary's really plans to do that this week.
Tom will be able to do that later.
The doctor advised me to leave jacking because it was too extra.
Tom said he wasn't ready, but Mary said she was.
I don't think Tom will be back.
Nobody was on the bus.
Tom said she'd hoped Mary could win.
Tom thought he was missing his wallet, but finally found it for a hour or so.
Tom told me she wasn't impressed.
I didn't think anyone really expected you to be here.
It was clear that Tom hadn't done that yet.
Tom and Mary are planning to go every bar on this street.
Tom said he thought I should do that soon.
You know your socks don't match?
You know this should be done today, don't you?
I think Tom is about to start crying.
She took him by the arm.
Tom said he felt scared.
It doesn't deserve the effort.
Somebody's waiting in your office.
I'm sorry we put you into this.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
Tom told me Mary did that.
I knew Tom could hurt if he tried to do that.
Isn't that what you would do?
Tom told me he thought Mary would be nice.
I guess it's not really important.
Why is Tom wearing a cave?
Tom said Mary was able to do that too.
That's a lot of people's making a mistake.
I don't think I'll be in Australia next week.
I know Tom didn't know I couldn't do that.
I know Tom is more young than Mary.
It's not an easy solutation.
Tom said his mother never loved him.
Tom should have stayed longer.
Tom knows he's in real trouble now.
No doubt Tom will do this for us.
I don't have anything to say to Tom.
I don't think Tom knows what I'm trying to do.
The men are wearing short wools.
Tom said she'd take care of Mary.
I knew that it would eventually happen.
It's not hard to imagine what will happen.
Tom will never hurt anyone.

I'm afraid I don't know.
Beauty lies in the sight of the seer.

I can't stand this voice.
I know Tom is much better than Mary.
The police believe Tom and Mary were killed.
I'm sure that's not going to happen.
Tom claimed he was born in 2013.
I don't think Tom's hard.
Tom decided to say yes.
I hope Tom isn't dead.
They said they don't do that.
Tom knows that's a hard situation.
Tom knew what he was going to do was going to make Mary angry.
Tom could have done that without Mary's help.
Tom thought she wouldn't have to do that.
Tom asked Mary if John was planning to stay.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be crazy.
Tom said Mary was willing to eat.
I hope I don't start crying.
You should have done that with us.
I don't think it's impossible.
I know Tom is a good swimmer.
Tom hasn't been appointed chair yet.
I wonder if there's any cheese left in the rerigerator.
What are you doing well?

We're not planning to do that together.
Let's check why your answers are different from me.

Tom said he wasn't fun.
I think Tom was in love with Mary.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
They say they like marigolts.
"Are everyone talking about me?" "No, Tom, you're not that important."
I don't think it'd be hard to do that.
It's not something I'm proud of.
Both Tom and Mary are still sick?
I can't believe you did that.
I knew Tom hadn't finished it yet.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom should go home.

I swear I'll tell you everything one day.
Forty-our four Americans have now taken a president vow, which is said in the ranks of prosperity and peace, but every time they are spoken, they are celebrating clouds and winds. In these times, the Americans have been carried only because of the talents or visions of those in high positions, but we were faithful to the ideas of our forebearers and our documents.

It's rapidly spread.
There's no way you get out like that.
If we don't take the threat of meteor, we'll all die.
You're ashamed.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary should do that tomorrow.
It's not strange, isn't it?
I didn't know I was violating any law.
You promise me that you'll do it?

Both Tom and Mary can do that.
I thought you could know.
Tom's fuck.
It's not always easy to face the truth.

Tom knew they were following him.
What was that supposed to mean?
I know I'm in great trouble now.
Why don't you ever do what I tell you to do?
Tom decided to let Mary go to Australia.
Tom would never have done that if Mary asked him not.
I thought you said you weren't interested.
It was harder than Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom will go to Australia with Mary.
I'm so tired.
I'm 18 years old.
They're not coming.
Tom doesn't know the rules yet.
Let's hope you're healed.
I know someone should do that.
I can't speak French either of you.
You should have listened to Tom more carefully.
Tom said I should let you drive.
What's your favorite fast-food restaurant?
Why is Tom wearing that hat?
Tom said he didn't want to wear John's old clothes.
I don't think we can do that.

The clock has stopped.

You should have heard me.
I'm giving you what you want.

They said they never wanted to do that.
They said they were eating fruit.

I think there's a good chance tonight.
I love you and I'll always do it.
No, no.
I know Tom's not a very good hitter.
I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they'll be willing to help us.
It's not open for the dispute.
Tom told everyone he wasn't working.
I know that would be hard to do.
How are you planning to do that?
It's out of me.
I'm a little out of shape!
Didn't you know Tom was seeing someone else?
It'll be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were so sweet.
I thought you knew that now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom is just as smart as Mary.
They wanted that they didn't say that.
I wonder if Tom's planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that she hoped Mary would be forced to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I'll get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad nobody around.
Tom said she'd hoped Mary would like the gift she had planned to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Wednesday is the last day of the week.
I know Tom's gonna know how to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary would be grumpy.
I know Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who's your favorite singer?
I promise you I'll help you.
Tom said she knew she wouldn't want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his chebella on the train.
I'm a lot more than Tom.
I know Tom can speak French, I wonder if Mary too can.
I know Tom would be quicker than Mary.
My handwritten is better than Tom.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they're not here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I think that's because Tom is a little bit.
I always wondered Tom was a little paranoid.
I know Tom knew I was planning to do that.
You should have done that better.
We're working every day, but we're on Monday.
I know you're not the guys who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
I know Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not hard.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited because I got married.
Tom told me she would cry.
I thought they would find someone else.
I was the only one who knew Tom didn't want to do that.
I'm very sure Tom did it for his purpose.
I thought you could be busy now.
Tom thought we should do this by ourselves.
I don't think that's an exception.
I know you don't like me so much.
I thought it was indescribable for us to do anything about this today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants today.
Tom said something about that last night.
Tom admitd he wasn't brave.
I know I had to do that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I'm sure Tom's waiting for us.
Who's dead can't break up.
I don't think Tom's as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I can do it by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She kept her eyes away.
Tom's not as tear as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do it by ourselves.
Tom says she's still planning to do that.
I thought Tom should be wrong.
Tom said Mary didn't care what she did.
They said they didn't like it.
Tom was the reason for Mary moved to Boston.
I should have met myself.
Tom says Mary's going to be tired.
I can't remember when she moved to Boston.
I never fall in love with anyone.
That's the first time Tom complained about it.
Tom likes everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He doesn't have a mobile.
I think Tom's gonna ask you to marry him.
Tom said that John might not be allowed to do this by himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I'm suspicious Tom is involved.
How many kiloss have you lost?
Tom and Mary are all right.
I'm a detestable human being.
I will never forget the time you and I went together to Australia.
Tom's not the only one who plans to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary both decided not to leave.
Tom told me she's sleeping.
Mary tried his mother's clothes.
Tom admits that she wore Mary's bicycle.
I ran out of the lid.
Tom said she was supposed to be in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you.
When is your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would help you.
I didn't know Tom and Mary were married already.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't think.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you were fun.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been in a dinner for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary had a driver's license already.
I know Tom is a very good drummer.
Tom realized he couldn't change anything.
Tom said she had to do that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy air.
Didn't you know Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I'm not sure Tom is at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me that they would do it again.
Tom's thrown down.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom had to leave the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to marry Tom.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they don't care.
Tom didn't stay in Boston as long as he wanted.
Tom said he was a Canadian.
I'd like to have another coffee coffee.
I pretend Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone knows that he enjoys doing it.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know Tom could do that for some time today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the skeptic.
I think Tom's insurance.
I don't think Tom knows when it's happening.
Is that true Tom moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked long.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess today.
I don't think I would like to live in Australia.
Tom said she had to do it by himself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was misled.
What you say is really wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary's cold.
They said they didn't enjoy it.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they never studied French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he wasn't supposed to do what he should do.
Tom told me I should say yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the fridge.
Tom said she knew she shouldn't do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak very well in French.
I don't think there's any chance I'll get there at the time.
I think both Tom and Mary will be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I should do that.
Tom said she didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he wasn't planning to go with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom is sure Mary wants to do that.
Tom told me that he couldn't buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everybody loves free stuff.
I don't think that's funny.
If Tom does that, I'll do it.
I know Tom's still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they were ready to help me.
Tom isn't the one who told me Mary should do that.
I thought you said you'd still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do that.
They say they're not planning.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom told him that she should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's offended.
I don't think I can't hold it a long time.
Tom isn't like Mary.
Tom said he didn't think Mary's cold.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom that I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I promised Tom I would help him.
I believe everybody deserves a chance.
Tom told me that he wouldn't be present at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to call it.
Tom said he knew Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights down, please.
Tom said it's a nice place to visit Australia.
I thought Tom was in great trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech's last for three hours.
I wonder if Tom is alive.
I can try to borrow a hatcher from Tom.
Tom might be surprised.
I don't think anybody wants to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom will not be in Australia a long time.
Tom told Mary she'd never come back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that by yourself.
I'm sure Tom will never agree.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wanted to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is incorrect.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know Tom's more likely to do this today than he's yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something wrong.
Our streets are drowned when we get rain.
I'll probably be busy afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choices.
Tom said he thought he could do it on October 20.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was going to do this.
I knew Tom could be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of the cake.
I know Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everybody's here except Tom did it.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has an idea of what Tom can do.
Tom knew he could do that better.
Tom said she wouldn't do that anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was disappointed.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've done enough for everyone.
I know Tom is the one to tell Mary that she should do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do it by ourselves.
You say you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that this will not happen.
Tom plans to sit back.
Tom said she was given a book to Mary.
It would have been impossible.
I know Tom's gonna know how to do that.
I know Tom was a kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're guilty.
I'm not surprised that Tom plans to do that.
Well, nobody expected Tom to win.
Don't hurt my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job would be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put your jacket down if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom said she wasn't planning to stay in Australia so long.
I hear you quit smoking.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing that.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me she thought she was divorced.
Tom told me she was next.
Tom said that Mary knew that she had to do this by himself.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
That's not salt.
Anybody here, Tom?
Tom told me she thought she was wrong.
My dogs sleep in the same room I do.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he's planning to do that.
I doubt Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I'm sure Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they were self-conceiving themselves.
Tom told me she thought Mary was careful.
Tom was sleeping in the living room.
I found both Tom and Mary like romance romants.
Tom knows I didn't do that last day.
I doubt Tom and Mary were busy all day long.
Tom told everyone he was ready to do that.
We'll go on a picnic tomorrow if it's good.
Promise me you won't tell anyone.
It's not Tom who needs protection.
They said they're mad.
I think Tom will be able to do that.
Tom did it every time he could.
They said their house wasn't for sale.
I'm not crying.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I think we have something more important to do now.
I think Tom and Mary were going to Boston at least one time.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should stop sleeping.
Can someone help me?
I know Tom's the same age as your daughter.
I know Tom is a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I wouldn't be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is easy.
I think Tom will be lonely.
It looks like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary's got to get into her new floor.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom to do that.
They swore that they would never do that.
Everybody stood there, shocked.
I look forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I'm sorry I didn't be careful as I should.
Tom doesn't look so good.
Tom said he thought I should do it by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard sounds in the mutchen.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary is sleeping or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, didn't you?
They wanted that they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I saw Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like it.
I thought Tom would have found Mary right now.
Tom said she wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't think Tom is guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning to do that.
Somebody has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know that Tom did that when he was hot.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
It's enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know Tom did that?
I guess it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It's not until you lose your health until you recognize it.
That could have shot me.
They told me they're losing the weight.
My house isn't big.
I'm sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I'm still planning to join the team, did you?
The bathroom wasn't so clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he never thought she could ever be able to convince Mary to go with him.
Tom thought Mary was the first one to do that.
Tom told me she thought she was an ambitious Mary.
That's what I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wanted to speak better French.
I can't dance.
Tom doesn't have a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know Tom knew I was the one to do that.
Tom doesn't miss, is he?
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did something bad.
I'm sure Tom would be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom to do that.
I thought Tom would never come up.
That's so good to be true.
Tom said that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I shouldn't have broken with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom had some bread on his dog.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know I had to do that.
It's not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm sure I can do that.
Tom says she and Mary will spend Christmas together.
Why did you fail in the entry examining?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me she had to leave.
Tom says she couldn't prove Mary.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were curious.
Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought she was really Mary.
I know there's a lot of good food on the picnic.
Is there any questions so far?
I'm sure Tom is not reliable to do that.
Tom never feared anyone.
They said they'd like to come next week.
What are you talking about?
Tom said he thought Mary was beaten by what happened.
Everybody in the room did the same thing.
They're independent.
Tom didn't know you were the one you wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You should have done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that to happen.
It would be wise to do that.
Tom told me she didn't have a problem with that.
Tom said she shouldn't go home by himself.
Tom has to be angry.
How long has your head been hurt?
Thank you, bud!
Tom said nobody was fired.
You think we should go to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He's got a cake.
I don't think Tom wants to do it by himself.
I don't know I can trust Tom.
Tom said she had told him that she needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life without parole.
I think that the weapon I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know Tom is a millionire.
Tom said he thought this would be safe.
I don't think I'm gonna let Tom do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I did it.
I think Tom doesn't eat meat.
I hope we have no problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
That's the first time Tom complained about the voice.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unreasonable for you to do it.
Tom said he could be the only one who knew Mary was living.
I know we can't trust Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom left Mary a month ago.
I think Tom will not be the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom is downstairs.
I need to know we can depend on Tom.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't be allowed to do that.
I realize that it's probably not happening.
They say the drug isn't safe.
I know that it's very unlike anybody can help me.
I think Tom's going to call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said he thought it would be a serious mistake to tell Mary what happened.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't cry.
It's enough to break me back.
That would never have happened if you did what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heat.
Anybody has a clenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could be a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a patophiliac.
I wouldn't say anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I'm both wrong.
I think you're still enjoying drinking.
I wonder if Tom and Mary could do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should talk to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You're not obligated to do that, are you?
You have a big head.
He's very shrewd.
I wouldn't have hired Tom.
Do Tom know you've already done that?
Tom's eating more than I'm eating.
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last Sunday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom says Mary is still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I would do that.
Tom told me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave now.
I know Tom will never do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to hurt if they are not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know Tom told Mary that she wouldn't do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
My time is taken by teaching and study.
I think Tom's been concentrated.
I don't think Tom would like that if we did it.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary can't do that.
They say they'll stop doing it.
Tom is incompatible.
Tom thinks Mary's drinking like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary told you.
Tom said she thought Mary couldn't do that.
I know Tom is a golf, maybe he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew Tom could do that without help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in winter.
What else do you plan to do?
I think Tom understands everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom is talking.
It's not my job.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I think you'd like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary came back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary last night.
I don't think anybody saw us.
I knew Tom wasn't a bad student.
Unlikely, Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll find our way back to camps?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit when I was in the future.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door close.
My grandmother text is faster than you.
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you would do this for Tom.
I didn't think nobody noticed what you did.
I wonder if I can help Tom.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know it's not hard.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary are not ready to do that.
I thought you might be hungry.
I thought Tom told you I'd be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia every week?
Tom said he didn't know Mary's going to leave him later.
You're still not afraid, are you?
I thought you would cry.
The value of health can't be decreased.
You're going to suffer because of this.
I don't think Tom knows how much she's gonna cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know Tom's nice.
Tom already knows Mary's planning to do that.
Don't take your gloves off.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wouldn't do that again.
Tom had to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a friendly friend.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know Tom isn't the one who has to do that.
I admit I've been resented Tom since I first met him.
Is there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the TV guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't good.
It's true that the earth is grass.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
Tom doesn't like people to know he can't speak well in French.
Check that girl.
Tom told Mary that she should be freed from being bossed.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
Tom thinks it's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a smart man.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I didn't want to admit that I couldn't do that.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever he needed.
Tom said she owes Mary a lot of money.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat with you.
It's not safe to go out after you're dark.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Tom knows Mary likes Boston.
Tom and Mary said they're not going to win.
Tom told me she was forgiven.
Tom said she thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one way of action.
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I never decided to do that again.
I didn't know you were Tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they don't need to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to do this today.
Tom and Mary say they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know everyone's talking about us?
Tom said she knew she didn't want to do that until next Sunday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom is sad.
I don't think Tom's going to win.
I would have wanted to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was striking.
Tom said she thought she had to do this by herself.
We wish we could do more to help.
Tom said he thought it would be snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be early home.
Tom said he would look at it.
Tom said that it was harder than he thought it would be.
You'd like the movie.
They told me they don't really care about what happens.
Tom's speech wasn't long before Mary was.
I didn't know Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I worried you.
Everybody seems scared, but you are.
Tom feared that his parents would start asking him questions and end up telling them everything.
Was the book you read in French yesterday?
I'm a damn doer.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was smelling.
He thinks I love him.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see Tom's happy again.
I thought Tom had already left.
I knew Tom couldn't keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have a lot of time.
Tom said she's trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would do that for me.
Tom is the most funny person I ever met.
I'm sure Tom really plans to do that.
Tom said she thought she shouldn't do that this week.
I know Tom wasn't supposed to do that.
To tell the truth, I'm not your father.
I don't think Tom will do that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom runs away from home, isn't it?
I thought you could go home.
Tom said she'd hope Mary's trying to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom had to do that this morning.
Tom says she knows Mary can't speak very well of French.
Tom didn't tell me where she was going to stay in Boston.
Tom didn't have to come here.
They said they enjoyed the challenge.
I know Tom was late.
Tom told me she was going home.
Tom told me that he lost his textbook.
Nobody knew Tom's going to do that.
That's right!
I thought I should do that.
I'm sure Tom doesn't have any brothers.
I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that.
I'm sure that's not going to happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary really tell the truth.
Do you all think this is a good idea?
It must have been broken during shipping.
They said they would not win.
Tom said he thought Mary was a good meal.
They didn't admit that they had done it yet.
Unless Tom knew he did not have to go to Boston.
I knew Tom knew why Mary should do that yesterday.
I know Tom is someone we can trust.
If I could speak French better, I could have got that job.
Do you feel OK today?
Tom and Mary said they could do that.
These turtles aren't in the California.
Tom told me that Mary didn't want to go to Boston.
They said they were Canadian.
I know you feel grateful.
I know Tom is a prison guard.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do anything John asks him to do.
Tom said he'd hoped he could buy what he needed for 300 dollars.
Tom said she was the only one who had to do that.
Both Tom and Mary joined the army when they were eight.
I knew who Tom did that for Mary.
Or a week's smelling the roofs.
Tom said he didn't like dogs.
Tom told me he thinks he'll win tomorrow.
I'm really tired of living.
Tom thought Mary's dress wasn't appropriate for this occasion.
You have kids?
Tom said he's glad he didn't do that.
I wonder if Tom's really finished.
I don't think nobody can do that.
Do you know Tom and Mary were still planning to do that?
Tom told me she thought she was too young to drive.
I'll be back.
I don't think Tom's nosy.
I wouldn't have done that.
I believe we don't really need to do that.
Tom could have been doing that quicker than Mary if she tried harder.
I knew Tom told Mary that she wouldn't do that.
I think you're wrong.
Tom told me he thought Mary was deaf.
I don't think I'm going out today because it's so cold.
Tom certainly made it clear that Mary didn't want to participate.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to do that.
Tom said he didn't forget to buy Mary's birthday present.
I wonder if Tom wants to play poker with us.
I don't think nobody can do that.
I thought we were already over all this.
I know Tom's a lot of smoking than I am.
Tom said she's not sure Mary shouldn't do that.
I don't think Tom is interested in going to Boston with us.
Tom said he thought Mary was a good meal.
Tom felt someone touching his hair.
I know Tom's not a history teacher, and I think he's a science teacher.
Who planned to stay with Tom?
Tom thought everyone knew what to do.
Someone stole my dinner.
I know Tom won't tell Mary why she's gonna do that.
Tom wasn't the one who told me Mary to do that.
Tom doesn't know anything about the plan.
Tom told me he had some things to take care of.
I didn't know I had enough time to do what to do.
Tom said she knew Mary wanted to do that.
Tom told me he was busy on Monday.
I didn't want to wake the kids up.
I know I'll be arrested.
That's more like that!
I think you could do it by yourself.
Did you know Tom wouldn't win?
Tom said he thought Mary was in danger.
I didn't think nobody could do that.
How do we know you're not lying to us?
I think you'd all agree with Tom is one of our best magnificents.
Tom didn't know Mary was in pain.
If I could, I would have gone to Boston.
You were planning to take pictures, didn't you?
I don't think Tom knows what to buy.
He's happy.
Tom said she knew she had a good time in Boston.
Gods are pleased with your actions.
I don't feel so good.
I thought it would be hard to do that.
I'm sure Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm sure Tom did nothing wrong.
I know Tom wouldn't have to do that anymore.
Tom said she was happy that she didn't do that.
You're not a city girl, are you?
They said they'll be there.
He knows we've done everything we can.
I think Tom's gonna want to see it.
Why do all think Tom and I are stupid?
Life isn't fair.

The same thing must have happened to Tom.
I know Tom's almost like I'm.
Tom didn't read everything carefully as he should.
We know Tom is unlikely to do that.
I knew Tom went to this school.
I'm afraid we'll have to start again.
I'm so sorry that happened.
That's an interesting prosecution.

Tom will be surprised if you don't do that.
Tom knew Mary was with John.
I promise I'll be back soon.
Tom said she shouldn't have stayed in the party so long.

I thought you would like to do it yourself.
Tom said she thought Mary would be scared.
Tom doesn't want Mary to know how to do that.
Tom refused to do that.

Call me!
You should have told Tom how you felt.
We'll consider your suggestion.
It's so bad for the health.
The paint is drying.
Tom might be lost.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is.
Hi, my name is Tom!

Is Tom really trying to shoot himself?
Who are you calling a stupid?
I call my brother.
There's a good chance Tom will do this for us.
I knew Tom wouldn't hurt me.

The way is long.

I would have done it at that time.
Tom and I are a little busy.

Why is Tom crazy at Mary?
They say they want something to eat.

They said they felt that they were manipulated.

That's the most smart movie I've ever seen.

How did you know Tom couldn't do that?
Tom doesn't have good terms with his family.
Tom can see things Mary can't do.
Tom said he was hoping to see how to do that.

Tom's planning to do that.
Who's the photographer?

I didn't understand.

Tom said she thought she would not be allowed to do that by herself.
I'm praying.
Tom told me she thought Mary was satisfied.
I don't think Tom knows the whole story.
I don't even think Tom saw me.
Put it on your chest.
That's the same for me.
I'm the first musician in my family.
Some people say there's no real love.
I'm not too good to get people up quickly.

The first person I met in Australia was Tom.
Everybody, but Tom knew he didn't need to stay in Boston.

Tom told me that she thought Mary was fired.
It's not a bad plan.
Did Tom know you're planning to do that?
Tom convinced me that you were the best person for the job.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't do that for her.
That water isn't cold.
I think Tom stayed in the last journal of Boston.
How could anyone vote to someone like me?
They said they were busy.
I know Tom is in his room to collect his suitcase.
Do you really believe Tom to buy you that?
I don't think nobody saw us doing that.
Tom told you to speak French.
I should have gone to the Dentist last week.
They told me they're shy.
I don't think Tom was adopted.
I swear I'm not high.
Tom and Mary gave me their old car.
Tom said she hadn't seen Mary for a long time.
Both Tom and I know you did that.
Tom told me I was broken.
I know both Tom and Mary are both sick.
I can't understand why anyone wants to do that.
Tom said he was interested in learning how to do that.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary what to do.
They still hope they can do that.
Tom said he'd get out of the way.
"Are anyone with you?" "No, I was alone."
I know you're not.
Tom told everyone that he was not reluctant to do that.
This box is so heavy!
I thought you said you wanted to go to Boston.
I met someone who knows Tom last day.
I know you can't get away from this.
Every time someone knocks at the door, my dog starts smelling.
Both Tom and Mary have the same problem.
There's no way you can do that by yourself.
I'm afraid there's something wrong with Tom.
The bill was hard to calculate.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I never met anyone like you before.
It would have been hard to do that.
Tom may be ready to do that.
Tom will try to help Mary do that.
It could have been worse.
Tom thinks that wouldn't be a good idea.
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Tom and I didn't go to the meeting yesterday.
How did you come to the party?
Do you think Tom's already rent?
I wonder if Tom still remembers how to do that.
Didn't you know Tom was used to live Boston?
I don't think it's gonna be rain, but I'll take an umbrella in case.
Tom promised him to tell us.
Tom said he didn't need to be hurry.
Both Tom and I are still high school students.
You're making a big mistake.
Tom says he saw a ghost.
Tom thinks Mary won't be lonely.
Tom and Mary said they would help.
Did the umbrella belong to Tom?
Tom had to do much better.
I know Tom's almost home on Monday.
I think Tom really hates you.
I know Tom would like to do that by himself.
Tom said he'd be retiring next October.
I didn't know Tom was playing the trumpet.
You think it'll rain this weekend?
I know Tom probably didn't do what he was supposed to do.
I don't remember asking you to do that.
There's no way I'm gonna let you do that.
Tom told everyone he was lonely.
I wonder if Tom is still busy.
What's the name of our CEO?
I know you're worried about Tom.
I thought I was very good.
Tom admits he was troubled.
Nobody could hear what Tom said.
Tom said she was going to visit Mary in Australia next journal.
They're queens.
Not everyone's ready.
There's going to be a storm.
Tom must have been skeptical.
Where's the meeting going to be held?
I think Tom is wrong.
Tom said Mary thought she wouldn't want to do that.
I thought it would be easy to do it.
Tom says she hopes Mary knows she has to do that.
It's not cold today as it was yesterday.
That's not a game for kids.
I hope you'll wait for us.
Tom said she was hoping Mary's here today.
Tom said Mary's worried.
Tom and Mary said they enjoy teaching French.
Tom said he's really glad Mary did that.
I wonder if Tom found anything.
I'm from South America.
I'd do that in another way.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary's coming or not.
I'm sure Tom had the courage to do that.
Tom doesn't want to go to his company for Christmas this year.
You're just a student.
Tom said she would never let Mary do that.
Why do you think Tom likes baseball so much?
I'll telephone you later.
Many people believe that this will not happen.
Tom knows he shouldn't have to eat the peanuts.
Tom told me he was going to try again.
I wish you had told me before.
Tom said she had confidence in Mary.
Tom thought she wouldn't have to do that anymore.
Tom told me she thought Mary was going through the time we got there.
I don't think Tom would let Mary do this on her own.
Don't study.
I thought you were still in Australia.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was disappointed.
I don't know that both Tom and Mary want to go there.
I don't think it's too long for you to do that.
I think Tom wants me to go with Mary.
I know you want to help.
Tom and I stood up at the same time.
They said they didn't have to be hurry.
I know you have something more important to think about.
I'm not deaf.
I didn't read all the books.
Tom should never have been out.
Did you know Tom wasn't planning to attend the meeting today?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she got him.
Tom said Mary's supposed to do that.
This is the kind of music I like to listen.
She choked herself a jumper.
I know Tom used to be good at that.
Tom wasn't the one who told Mary that she didn't need it.
I knew Tom was afraid that the police might arrest him.
I'm suspicious Tom didn't visit Australia.
I thought it would take a month.

It's a pain we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me that you were with him yesterday afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know we were the people we had to do that.
I'm so tired that I can walk hard.
They felt that they had to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but nobody speaks.
You set a trap.
I should have added more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary were married.
I think Tom's smelled.
Tom and Mary say they will never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have come home by himself.
Both Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she didn't plan this by himself.
It shouldn't be fun.
They said they were under pressure.
Tom didn't tell us what to do yet.
I know you don't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
If only you helped me last day, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said she was expecting Mary to go back to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said he thought he was supposed to do that again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew Tom told Mary that she couldn't do that.
Tom said she had to leave early.
They realize they're ignored.
If Tom left at 2:30, he would have been here now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom decided to stay in Australia for three days.
Tom said he thought I wasn't inconvenient.
I should stay and help Tom.
Tom said he thought I could do that.
I thought Tom would have paniced.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it's gonna be snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom approves.
I'm flying fish.
The wind was calmed at night.
Tom said that it might be dangerous.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that right now if he really wanted to do it.
I know Tom could do that if he really needed it.
We'll never know.
Tom admits that she killed Mary.
Didn't you know your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom will never hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very quickly.
You're not going to be troubled for helping me, are you?
I've heard the women's spending more shoes than men.
I think Tom's gonna be excited.
We'll be moving in 15 minutes.
Tom said she would take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do whatever he wants.
I thought you were going to fix it.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told that he wouldn't be allowed to do that.
They say they're in doubt.
I know Tom didn't know he couldn't do that.
Tom had to tell me before.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John would do that.
They say they also need to do that.
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they would help me.
I don't think I'd ever be able to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they're snatching.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everybody knew Tom could speak well of French.
Tom said he'd find something.
It's not a contribution.
Tom said he never thought Mary was in Australia.
I don't think Tom's looking like John.
Tom said he thought the prices in that store were too high.
I don't think anyone's arguing about that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he'd hoped he could do this today.
You knew everyone in the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unconscious.
I'm sorry it's like that.
I know Tom isn't afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will do that without help.
It's hot.
Tom told me she didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me whether I like it or not.
Many old people today can't be able to stay with the time.
Tom hope he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he was going to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom probably thought Mary wouldn't do that.
I'm sure you'll be successful.
Tom denied that she accepted the bribe.
Tom said he thought that this wouldn't be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom told me to do.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me that she thought she was disappointed.
Can't that wait until morning?
We'll be moving in 15 minutes.
We know that will not happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom isn't incorrect.
I'm afraid I lost it.
Tom said she'd probably be grumpy.
We're both adults.
They are not as weak as they were.
I know Tom had to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do this today.
Don't talk about business when we eat.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard.
I hope Tom's adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She has to be taken to hospital.
I would help you if you asked him.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
That's not a drill.
Tom had to do that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept all morning.
I wonder if Tom's upset.
Tom said that they couldn't let him go at school.
Tom said she wants Mary to do that.
Tom would have done this for Mary if she had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something is still not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked rituals.
I know Tom's not planning to go to Boston with you.
Tom said she's not sure Mary had to do that.
I didn't think Tom could talk to Mary to do that.
Are Tom and Mary planning to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought it would be fun.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
I thought it was a genius.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are gonna do that?
What do you think Tom and Mary were those who did that?
Are you still planning to do this with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
Her young sister is a famous TV star.
I know when you said you were there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're murmuring.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's think that's gonna happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone who could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that she thought she was truthful.
It's probably likely Tom's coming.
I'm sure Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think nobody had tried this before.
You should have used your time better.
They say they're not planning.
Tom said it was like Mary's very hard time to do it.
I'm learning old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could do that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was hard to get together.
They said they were very drunk.
You could have told me before.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was locked.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know Tom never does that anymore.
Tom says only when it is necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said he shouldn't say what he shouldn't say.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me that this book was interesting.
Tom thought everybody knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he was planning to go on October 20th.

Tom thought everybody at school knew he was arrested.

Tom was just quoting the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he could do that in a few hours.
No one doubts you can pass through the examination.
Where is everyone?
How do you feel?
Fortune favors the brave.
They don't know they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still looking at me.
I thought Tom heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope nobody comes.
What color was Tom dressing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do this if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said she'd go home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should have purchased someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was under pressure.
I'm wondering if Tom knows he's over.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me that he was too tired to study.
Where's your gangge?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that is not true?

That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said she thought she could help her to do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is Cubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I don't know, Tom will be willing to talk to me.

I didn't think you could get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, little German.
Tom thought a bad thing would happen.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I know that it's so unlike anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorceyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I'm sure Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I enjoy playing volleyball.
It probably doesn't mean Tom will admit that he's wrong.
Tom said he couldn't win.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that soon.
There's a possibility Tom don't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
He's a bloom girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.

I would have let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was harder than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.

They swear that they wouldn't do that again.

Don't cheap the little things.
I don't think nobody can help me now.
Tom said it's a very common problem.
Are you sure that's gonna work?
I'm afraid I'm gonna be tied in the afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed unwilling to do that.

I was surprised that Tom didn't want anyone else to do what he wanted.
Tom said she knew she'd be allowed to do this tonight.

I don't think you'll have much fun to do that.
I'm sure Tom doesn't do that as often as he does.

I'm planning to smell lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do if you asked him.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was scared.

You shouldn't have refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't like Tom to meet Mary.

Tom doesn't have a car, nor Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he wasn't different.

Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I'm sure Tom is still in love with his old-wife.
I know Tom knew that Mary was the one to do that.
Tom's too easy to wait for anyone.
I just thought everybody would do that.
I don't think you understand what that means.
It's not possible.
I don't think you've got the guts.
I've been busy yesterday.
Tom said I shouldn't try it by myself.
Tom said he didn't want to do that.
Tom was the one who told me that I needed to do that.
I didn't think we could get home by 2:30.
Tom said he couldn't sleep last night.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was creative.
Tom could have come tonight, but he didn't.
I didn't know Tom didn't want to do that alone.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
I wonder if Tom was able to do this by himself.
Maybe it would be better if I hadn't done it.
I'm sure Tom's gonna have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not busy now as I was last year.
I would have talked to Tom rather than to ignore him.
I thought you would meet my family.
I don't think Tom will be disobedient.
Tom said he was going to do this every day after he was retired.
I don't have much to help, I'm afraid.
Both Tom and Mary are not yet married.
I know Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that.
We're in school together.
I want you to look at these documents.
Tom's tired.
Tom said he didn't need a lawyer.
Tom and Mary said they were going through the train.
I didn't know Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.
Tom said he was going to ask Mary to leave.
Tom and Mary are going out to walk after dinner.
I know Tom's grouchy.
Tom's gone.
It would be hard to do that.
Tom said he didn't know anything about Mary.
I thought Tom lived in Australia.
I'm so surprised that Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom doesn't think you can do that.
Tom said he thought he was arrested.
I don't think Tom is available.
I don't think Tom's doing that.
I wonder if Tom's interesting.
I don't think Tom like the song you wrote about him.
I think I'll take this tie.
Tom thought she wouldn't have to do that by himself.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary never did that before.
Tom gave me all the money I asked for.
Tom said Mary knew that John would want to do this by himself.
The wood was broken with water.
I don't think Tom understand.
They said they'd be handed up.
Tom can do that, but Mary can't.
I don't think it's a problem anymore.
Tom told me that he thinks he'll do that tomorrow.
I thought it would be clear in the afternoon.
Tom told me that she hoped Mary would be done by 2:30.
I'm a insomniac.
Tom said she'd ask Mary if she wanted to do that.
I know that doesn't matter.
Tom says Mary is trustworthy.
Tom and Mary told me they enjoyed the picnic.
I know I shouldn't do that, but I did it.
I think Tom is the one who painted this fence.
Tom must have thought Mary could speak French.
He's a very beloved father.
How would Tom know Mary would do that?
Tom told me she was in a lot of trouble.
Tom thinks that will rain tomorrow.
I didn't know Tom had a weapon.
I thought Tom had a good chance to do that.
I didn't think Tom would want your old bicycle.
I wonder if Tom knows who left this package on my skeptic.
Tom had to be found guilty.
It's not working yet.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be angry.
You're not really planning to help Tom, are you?
Tom, it doesn't need to apologize.
I'm late.
Tom knows he has a problem.
I became a doctor so I could help people.
You can't buy happiness.
You promised you would do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be away.
It won't be as hard as you think it'll be.
Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't like her.
You over 18?
Tom won't leave his children here with us.
Tom didn't know we wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought you were going to do that.
Tom said that Mary was supposed to do that next time.
Tom said he did it for Mary.
Tom said he doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
Tom said Mary isn't sure if John wants to do that.
I thought things would be better.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't quick to do that.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't doing that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was locked.
The way you plan to do this is dangerous.
You should have come soon.
I think Tom is strong.
Tom and Mary didn't know they were supposed to be here yesterday.
I'm sure Tom will be there.
Tom said she's really glad she moved to Australia.
I know Tom is a forest range.
It'll be hard for Tom to do that.
They said they were just talking to you.
French is his mother's language.
I don't think Tom should do that alone.
Tom took his bag and left.
I'm not the only one who is not married here.
Tom said he knew he couldn't do that again.
They know they should do this today.
You should have been a lawyer.
I'm sure Tom doesn't know I'm here.
I don't think I need to wear a tie to the party.
I don't think there's no reason for Tom to do that.
Tom said she'd be still depressed.
I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
I know Tom hadn't even asked Mary to do that.
Tom told me that she thought she was a talented.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I'm afraid Tom couldn't do what he's supposed to do.
Tom said she didn't want to go to the concert.
Tom told me she was going to drive Mary to the airport.
Tom said he's driveing to Boston on Monday.
They told me they were sleeping.
I know you and Tom will do this together.
I think that's the first time Tom did this.
Tom hoped he would not be punished.
I know Tom is a very rich man.
Tom must have been home at that time.
I don't think I'd like to be here.
There's no hope.
Tom could have left with you if you let him know you're going.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary did that even though she asked him to do it.
Tom told me he thought Mary was still interested in doing that.
Are you good at reading the maps?
Tom says Mary is a lot.
I'm sure Tom will never do that.
I think Tom's probably a good lawyer.
I thought I could do that without any help.
You're getting my leg.
I thought you would never try to do that by yourself.
I don't think we'll do it by ourselves.
I know Tom's the last one to do that.
Tom said he would give Mary a book.
I know Tom didn't know why I was planning to do that.
Tom didn't know I was Mary's cousin.
They said they didn't know any French.
I thought you could quit.
I didn't know how Tom was trying to tell Mary not to do that.
I thought you wanted to be a dancer.
I don't think I'd be very good company.
Tom says the party's over.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom said I wouldn't want to do that by myself.
The security is not guaranteed.
Tom didn't offer to help.
I think Tom's gonna be true.
I thought Tom told you I'd be here.
Did you know I was going to be arrested?
He's a detestable human being.
Tom's already wanting to do that.
Take off your school uniform.
I'm sure Tom's gonna help Mary do that.
I'm afraid I can't.
I know Tom's almost cool as you do.
When I first met Tom, he was only six years old.
Tom says he's his favorite country in Australia.
I'm sure Tom never did that.
I thought we could help.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a child?
I'd like to stay longer.
Tom plans to do that today.
You're the same age as I am.
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try to do it.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Tom said she wanted Mary to give her flowers.
They said they had alibis.
Tom was able to do what he needed.
I knew you wouldn't like Australia.
I couldn't think of anything.
I wish you never told me.
Tom won't know I'm here.
I don't think you're a good driver as you say.
Tom said she didn't think she had to do that.
They told me they were lonely.
What's the time now?
Tom said things were good.
Tom told everyone he didn't know how to speak French.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary learned how to do that.
I'm sure we can prove that.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
Tom was surprised that no one was there.
I'm not surprised that Tom doesn't have to do that.
He's not very good at politics.
Tom thought it was funny to put a egg on Mary's chair.
They said they didn't feel hot.
That's the first time I was eating in Italian pizzeria.
Tom said he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow morning.
Tom says he doesn't want to do that.
I thought you said nobody's going to be here.
Tom thinks Mary's shy.
I'm skind.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Tom's drinking less than Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that.
One can't do a lot of things at the same time.
I can't remember her name.
Daddy works.
Tom and Mary say they're not afraid.
I'll save you a piece of a piece.
I thought I was going to be asked to give a talk.
It's a privilege to meet you.
Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him that she had to do that.
Tom said he thought you could help us today.
I was used to stay late.
I thought Tom looked happy.
Tom told Mary to do somewhere else.
Nobody seems to want to do that.
Tom said that he knew that he would not be supposed to do that.
Nobody told you about the meeting, did they?
I know this is Monday.
Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for him.
I think Tom was supposed to be here now.
I know Tom and Mary are divorced.
Tom must have seen us.
I know Tom doesn't know he's supposed to do this here.
I know Tom's going to do this in Australia last month.
Tom has no reason to do that.
Mary told me that she thought Tom was beautiful.
I didn't know you would be jealous.
I think both Tom and Mary want something to eat.
They said they didn't think of it.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Tom said I was the one to tell Mary not to do this here.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I knew Tom should do that outside.
I wonder if I should do that.
I'm sure Tom and Mary know something happens.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was retired.
What's your last name?
Tom told me she thought she had left.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should do that.
I know Tom's going to know that Mary's going to do that anymore.
You're cool than me.
Tom said he was drowsy.
They said they tried to do that once.
Tom said he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks.
I should have told Tom not to believe what Mary said.
It would have been interesting to do that.
If you had told me before, I would have dressed.
I think Tom's scared.
Tom said she's sure Mary can swim.
What's his problem?
I think Tom's focusing.
I'm not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
Why are everybody looking at me?
Tom has everything he needs.
They view foreigners with suspicion; I see everyone with suspicion.
I don't think I can do that better than you.
You could have let me know you'll be late.
Tom's crazy.
A willingness to correct matters is a sign of wisdom.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think nobody wants to do that today.
It's not as humiliation today as it was yesterday.
If I knew how to do it, I would do it myself.
Tom restored his bicycle.
You're not really planning to get pictures, are you?
He's two years older than me.
Tom and Mary told me that they were disappointed.
I didn't know Tom had to do that anymore.
I thought you said you saw people doing that.
It's obvious Tom's waiting for someone.
He doesn't watch TV.
Tom said he wasn't reluctant to do that for us.
Give it back!
Tom said she thought Mary could help us today.
I thought the concert went well.
I can't eat at all.
I thought Tom knew what we should do.
I'm afraid your plan will not work.
I don't think nobody saw us doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary could win.
I wonder if Tom had another one.
Nobody seems to have fun except Tom.
Tom said he needed money so he could buy something to eat.
Tom wasn't surprised Mary did that.
I knew Tom was finished.
I don't know that's possible.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me.
I thought Tom was still at school.
I knew Tom would be the next one to do that.
They'll be glad they didn't do that.
They say they'll buy it for you.
They say they don't need money.
Tom doesn't want to go by himself.
I know Tom didn't have to do that with us.
Everybody agrees that it was the right decision.
Tom got out of the bathroom and put his clothes on it.
I don't think Tom's planning to help us.
They say they feel better now.
I think you're going to dance with Tom.
Tom thought I would have to do it by myself.
I don't think that's anyone I know.
I don't think Tom did what you said.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
I don't think Tom will be hard to do that.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary wanted to go.
Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children.
Tom really thought we shouldn't do that.
It's not good for anyone.
Tom said he's often thinking about leaving.
Do Tom and Mary know you don't like them?
I know I'm so stupid.
Tom and Mary are both full-time students.
I know that Tom and only Tom need to do that.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary should do that today.
I doubt Tom and Mary don't like me so much.
I wonder if I can do that.
Tom thought we really wanted to do that.
I wish I could visit Australia.
She's eating.
He's my love for my life.
I think Tom is a good painter.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing for dinner.
It wasn't hard to find a pair of shoes like that.
I wouldn't have allowed Tom to do that.
I promised Tom to go to Australia with him.
Tom sings better than me.
Tom said he had a hard day.
Do you feel like swimming?
Tom and Mary still hope they can win.
Tom knows we can't win.
I don't think I can do that.
You're gonna be blamed.
I thought you said your car was thieved.
I didn't know Tom would be faster than Mary.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children.
If Tom doesn't do that, I won't.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was funny.
I know Tom didn't know Mary should do that.
I wonder if Tom really stayed in the Boston last journal.
Tom knew he would never return in his heart.
We're not ready to go home yet.
Tom should have eaten more.
I thought Tom was going to give Mary flowers.
Tom said that Mary was supposed to do this in the near future.
I didn't think we had enough food to feed everyone.
I should have listened to what my mother said.
Tom's breaking time.
I think Tom was exaggerating.
I was convinced I shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary is still sad.
If this is crazy, there's a method in it.
Tom told me everything I needed to know.
They told everyone that they were disappointed.
Tom said he wouldn't do that unless I help him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sincere.
She knows about things like that.
I don't think I never heard about Mary's dinner.
I'm sure Tom and Mary are ready to do that.
What's your pharmacy name?
I don't think anyone else wants to come.
I knew Tom was very busy.
Tom said he thought I shouldn't do that until October.
What's worried about you, Tom?
Tom is a traveling salesman.
I'm sure Tom isn't in Boston anymore.
Tom is sure he needs to do that.
That's the first time I visited Australia.
I knew Tom didn't know he didn't really have to do that.
Everybody knows we killed Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't go to Australia with us.
No dinner's not ready yet.
I hope I can help you tomorrow.
Of course we could do it, but it would be really hard to do it.
I could have saved Tom's life.
There's a good chance Tom will ask Mary to dance.
Tom told me he found an interesting book about Australia in the local library.
I don't think we can take care of ourselves.
Do you need a lift?
I thought I made my reasons clear.
Tom is someone I'm looking at.
Tom says he's sorry he broke his promise.
I think I just have enough money to buy the computer I want.
I know Tom's gonna try to do that.
I'm so glad to see you.
They said they were cold.
I know Tom knows I don't have to do that.
Tom just did what he had to do in the last week.
Tom says he doesn't usually wear it down.
I know Tom is a better musician than Mary.
Tom said he thought she knew Mary knew what she was planning to do.
Tom and Mary said they would win and they did.
Nobody knew that, but Tom.
Tom thought Mary wasn't cold.

I thought Tom would be happy about that.
I know Tom would allow you to do that.
Tom told Mary that she didn't think John was sleeping.
Tom's going to Boston every chance he gets.
I know Tom never thought to do that.
Didn't you know I was hoping Tom would do that?
They said they'd call you later.
I promise we'll listen to everything you say.
I think you'll enjoy it there.
It's not all that crazy.
I wonder if we have to do that.
Tom told me that he couldn't do that today.
The fuse has been ripped.
Tom and Mary weren't able to help me do that.
Tom should have been interested.
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do that today.
It's not good to scoff people in public.
We should have planned for this.
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you didn't do that.
They say they never did that.
Tom and Mary said they're not going to do that.
I know Tom's connected.
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's get married.
Get the fuck out!
I think Tom was at least to Boston at least one time.
He leaves to Tokyo tomorrow.
I wasn't as helpful as I should.
Tom said she was living in Australia.
They told me that they don't like to study in the morning.
You tricked me!
We're too busy for that, Tom.
Is this a seat empty?
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
You're free to go.
I know Tom's sure.
Tom thinks it's good.
Tom said he and Mary had a fight this morning.
Tom may be lying.
I heard Tom lives in Australia.
Nobody told me that I shouldn't have parked there.
Tom could have taken the money.
Tom doubted Mary would keep her promise.
Make sure nobody gets in.
I'm sure that's gonna change.
Tom told everybody that she was stuck.
It was clear that Tom would do that with Mary.
I doubt Tom is drunk.
I met someone who knows us yesterday.
Tom told me she didn't have a suicide.
I hope I can live here with you.
Those aged elements were taken to the most bloc for the discussion.
Tom said he felt good about it.
I'm sure Tom and Mary know something interesting is about to happen.
You know I need to do that, don't you?
They must have found out who I was.
I don't think I passed the test.
I knew Tom was a bad loss.
I don't think Tom's dead.
They said they didn't feel anything.
I knew Tom would like Mary.
I don't think Tom would be afraid if you did it with him.
Tom said he thought he couldn't win.
My America's impression is very good.
I don't like anybody's worried when I work.
They stayed friends.
Tom told me that she hoped Mary would be back soon.
Tom said she didn't let Mary do that.
Tom said she thought Mary was fun.
Tom said he thought Mary didn't like John so much.
I don't think Tom can do it without help.
It's not hard to do that.
I'm so sorry I'm kissing Tom.
I'm scared.
Tom told me he was very hungry when he came home.
Tom said she wouldn't know how to do that.
I don't think Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning to do that.
Tom said he heard three shoes.
I think you're shit-up.
Didn't you know Tom had a dog?
I knew Tom wouldn't stop doing that.
Tom and Mary told me that they were lying.
Tom's a horrible, just like John.
I'm sure Tom's going to happen.
I'm a friend of Tom.
I thought Tom would forget me now.
They say they're hard work.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes him or not.
I don't think I can move to Boston the next year.
The only person who could do this is Tom.
They told me they were good.
I thought if I broke you, I would never have to see you again.
I'm damning the classroom.
I know Tom knew Mary wanted to do that.
Tom and Mary said they were depressed.
Tom knows I don't like him.
I know Tom doesn't know I have to do that.
Tom said I had to leave before.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could do that by himself.
Tom said he had forgotten the door.
It's hard to do that, right?
The present from Tom was the best.
I don't think I have enough money.
Tom wasn't given the opportunity to give you and me.
How did you know Tom was planning to do that?
Will you give me a pen?
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
I feel I've been here before.
Tom was crazy to everyone.
Tom said Mary is still alive.
What's the most stupid thing you ever did?
Tom and Mary didn't tell anyone that they would win the catery.
Is there any possibility Tom want to do this with us?
Tom and Mary are like old movies.
Tom and Mary said they could do that today.
Tom woke up the kids and told them to prepare for school.
I don't like you.
Tom said he thought Mary would be hungry.
Tom said Mary thought she wouldn't want John to do that by himself.
I didn't know you were planning to do that while you were in Australia.
I don't think Tom rides his motorcycle anymore.
Tom said he doesn't feel like that.
I know Tom doesn't know why I did that on Monday.
Tom must have done that.
I don't think Tom knows he's never able to do that.
I can't stand with the voice anymore.
I know Tom didn't know we can't do that.
I hope you already know what to do.
Didn't I tell you I wouldn't go to Australia?
Tom said he thought it would be better if we didn't do that here.
Tom said he didn't want to leave.
Tom told me that she thought Mary would be home.
You're a better chess player than me.
Tom said he liked the idea.
I'll watch TV tonight.
I think Tom is a few months older than Mary.
I think you know Tom already.
I should have kissed Tom.
I know Tom knows why I should do that.
I'm sorry I opened your mail by mistake.
Tom thought Mary wasn't done that yet.
I wonder if Tom could do that.
If I'd take that plane, I wouldn't be alive now.
I don't think Tom would enjoy this movie.
I'm sure your motives are honorable.
I know Tom is the same weight I am.
Tom said he didn't know why the meeting was postponed.
You should have taken his advice.
They say they like that.
I know someone needs to do that.
Tom told me she wasn't afraid to do that.
I hope Tom isn't tired.
They said they were conservative.
I don't think I'll be scared.
I know Tom can't really do that even if he says he can.
We could do it by ourselves.
I thought you had a idea.
Tom and Mary said they were disheartened.
I wonder if Tom really is home.
I know Tom knows I'm not supposed to do that.
Both Tom and I haven't done that yet.
Don't pick your neck.
I have to do something with these radius.
Tom was thrown into criminals and was driven.
I didn't know you needed to do that.
Tom says he's planning to stay in Australia as long as he can.
I don't think there's any way I can help you.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't forgive him.
I don't think I can help you.
I know Tom's a kind of man who would do that.
I'm sure Tom will help Mary do this.
Tom said he didn't know how Mary would do that.
I'm not going to tell anyone you're in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to do that alone.
Tom said Mary didn't look too worried.
Tom can move more faster than Mary.
Tom would have done that first time if you helped him.
I'm in a cold weather.
I think that Tom hurt his leg.
I know Tom didn't know that she should do that.
The current political situation isn't very tough.
Tom said his son was a good athlete.
Tom and Mary said they weren't jealous.
Tom's contract expirs on October 20th.
I don't think Tom would be nervous.
I know Tom is a Red Cross volunteer.
I knew Tom wouldn't do what we asked him to do.
They told me they were ready to do that.
I don't think Tom did it.
How did you know Tom would be in Australia every week?
I thought Tom wasn't surprised.
I thought you said we're not going to sing.
They said they'd do that soon.
I know the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
I can't believe you wanted to do that.
I have the impression that Tom's doing good.
Tom didn't know Mary was John's girlfriend.
They said they were very sick.
I know Tom did that once.
Tom's waiting.
I think both Tom and Mary never did that.
I knew I should have studied French.
Tom said you're stubborn.
Maybe next time!
I think Tom is lying.
I know Tom knows I shouldn't do that.
I thought you could be in Australia this week.
I'm sorry I waited so long for you today.
Tom thinks Mary's glad that's going to happen.
It's not until you get sick until you recognize the value of good health.
I thought I'd broke my leg, but a X-ray showed that I didn't.
Tom said he didn't know Mary did that.
We don't have much to help.
I don't think Tom understand what we want to do.
I don't know what it is.
I wonder if Tom knew I had to do that.
I'm sure the police are going to arrest Tom.
I've lived here forty years.
Tom told me that he hated it.
Tom said he thought I was dead.
Tom said I don't need to do that.
They told me that they would do this for us.
Tom told me that Mary knew that John was allowed to do that.
I'm not proud of my behavior.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to talk.
I don't think Tom likes your song.
I would do that if I could.
They said they wouldn't try to do that.
I don't think Tom and Mary have a lot of common.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to do that.
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom told me that she hoped Mary would cooperate.
Something's wrong here.
I didn't know Tom lived in the Dormith.
I thought you would like to see this.
Tom told me she wasn't planning to join the team.
I hope Tom's glad that's going to happen.
They told me that they would probably do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were free.
Tom said Mary would go to Australia with her.
Tom wouldn't have done that even if he wanted to.
Oh, Boston isn't all like Chicago.
I should really tell Tom not to go to Boston.
I think my neighbor may have died.
I don't think Tom has done that yet.
I don't think Tom would be late if she had a good reason.
Tom's eating.
Tom said she thought Mary would be cold.
Tom said he thought we could win.
I don't trust governments.
I didn't think there was anyone I knew in Australia.
Do you think I should go to Australia with Tom?
I think Tom should stay here with us.
