Parliament does not support the amendment allowing freedom of Timoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in its amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected the attempt to repeal an article condemning the opposition leader, Julia Timoshenko.
An amendment that would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister's prison was rejected during the second reading of the bill on mitigating sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider Timoshenko's appeal in December.
Timoshenko argues that the sentence is a political measure of the regime; in the West the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes in favour.
Libya's Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert.
It's time to identify the winners.
Islamists are usually defeated in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the ordinary Shariah law, of which we have already heard.
Libya will become a crime-free country because the penalty for theft is hand cutting.
Women may forget emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be a order in Libya that we cannot imagine, and it is unlikely that we would wish for it.
In any case, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind nor the best and most likely would not have come, for example, to the people of Libya.
It is surprising, in fact, that Islamic fighters received help from unbelievers.
Their only justification is that, in their opinion, NATO attacked, not the U.S. general, but Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each strike.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies have been rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of any benefit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to renounce the Libyan military occupation.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the expulsion of the Crusaders.
Although without occupation, would black Libya’s gold companies receive virtually no price?
They're probably not getting it, and then the West will finally be able to snoop in the useless protection of civil rights.
Unless Shariah's followers put an end to this.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are currently the focus of investor attention.
A statistical storm swept over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have released GDP data in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnating, Germany and France were showing growth.
Still, the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are not only looking towards Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries announced their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP rose by the expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany had a better case than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the initial information was stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was stagnating, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it remained stagnant compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
Between July and September, both the Eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with analysts' projections.
Greece's economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2 per cent.
The profitability of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
Both Italian and Spanish bond yields are approaching the critical note.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the yield of Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Congregation passed a team at EURO.
In Montenegro, they won a 1-0 bill and celebrated an unexpected 200 million cash prize.
The National Team successfully managed the most challenging task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Bohemian and beautiful goal of Peter Jirach, they won with a score of 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team was fortunate to retain a significant advantage after the home retreat, and it will once again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the course of the match and prepared a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first time and great luck in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, in part due to the defeat of the team at the end; the Grand Bohemia; and the heroic Yiraček; won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrated the European Championship.
The Czech team's excellent defense allowed Montenegro's team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damijanović and Vukinić became the most failed match after two great opportunities had been missed.
The great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute, the game was very intense.
Both teams had difficulty in making combinations; the game was at the centre of the field for most of the time.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the team of masters in the first time, and the further attacks on the defence line were intercepted by Czech defence attorneys.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a live shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
Thus, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, the students prayed at the entrance to the building for death in both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a live shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the expense of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Agency for Nuclear Energy (IAEA) indicated that everything showed that Iran had not attempted to obtain nuclear weapons.
Possible attacks on nuclear facilities in Iran were discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, the students prayed in front of the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysation of the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives will be, according to the Israeli press, to install both in Isfahan and in Nathanza, where uranium is enriched.
Nutrition of children who suffer from obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to the latest study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families who lead an unhealthy lifestyle.
We see once again the importance of the environment and behavioural patterns associated with the person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausages appear on tables of children with obesity almost twice as much as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of obese children ate fries on the eve of an educational survey called Obesity is no accident.
Moreover, the families of children who suffer from obesity do not engage in sports, but most of the families of modern schoolchildren, only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents find time for sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year, with nearly 900 primary - class students participating throughout Bohemia.
Obesity was not an accident for the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient sports load are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer either from excessive weight or from obesity.
“For example, only half of those interviewed said that they were eating five times a day, according to the breakfast lunch-rehearsing-dinner scheme, and that was one of the absolute conditions of proper nutrition”, says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch and no sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details such as the permanent time of a family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren's families have breakfast together.
In most families, all breakfast is done separately.
The worst discovery was that in every tenth family, people don't eat at all.
Still, breakfast is the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study found that roasted food is used more frequently in families with children who suffer from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweets every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure decreases more than twice, to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In another part of the study on selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), it was suggested that they draw up their own menu on the basis of the proposed products and on the basis of their tastes and preferences.
“Food preferences for Czech children 12-15 years of age are far from ideal for healthy diet.”
Their favorite food includes a large quantity of floury, meaty, and sweet dishes.
“Special concern is the high popularity of sweet cool drinks”, says the final part of the study.
As the main dish, the pasta beat the bird with a small overhang.
However, children had little interest in beans, fish and vegetables.
Desiring a Healthy Life - Style
The study also showed that children were willing to change their eating habits, provided that information was provided.
“Many participants in the monitoring group of the study demonstrated a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they filled out the questionnaire after the Obesity lecture was not an accident”, the project concluded.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet cool drinks -- more children prefer just water.
In addition, as a basic dish, children were more likely to observe birds and fish, limiting the amount of sweet meal and baking.
Stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article on stylists ’ training, I visited introductory information.
I had no idea what would go on.
Lessons from three experts in this area; advice on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all these work in real life.
Next, more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alanka, director, (there are no men in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetrical.
Most women are not exactly symmetric.
In one short neck, in another male figure, without proper shape, another weighs more.
Steelist should know how to visually reduce broad shoulders, extend necks or add missing volumes.
We were advised to emphasize the figure of women such as Jennifer López, who had a bigger breast and thigh and narrow waist, and not to wear them too eloquently.
For example, if the difference in waist and thighs is so large that you cannot pick up a pair of skirts or pants, you should have at least one item sewn to order.
You're obviously not going to regret the money you've invested because perfectly sitting clothes are priceless.
In a skirt sewn on an order, you'll feel much better than the one who keeps coming, hangs around, sets his waist, etc.
On the other hand, they may wear clothing with towels, application, embroidery, or folding.
Given the abundance of such information and the type of figures, I am glad that I have a week to understand all of this.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much given the homework we've got.
Each participant in the course had to come up with two outfits for any celebrity, day and night.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style of clothing and the type of figure.
I have to dress for Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy for myself because it's much easier to wear than let's say Britney Spears, Kristina Aguiler, who's just gotten a ton recently (if you think I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out of magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them using graphic programs.
Mudboard -- so called the result of the work -- then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep the graphic composition of the style in mind.
Steelist not only wears real people, but creates food pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it was only Sunday.
Stylist Needs Common Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on the types of figures, revived three guests, specialists in this area.
Stylist, Honza Pokorny; fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, coats can be worn normally, on top of jeans and T-shirts, like a coat; but they can also be worn on a bare body, with no prints like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he emphasized.
In any case, I appreciated the following advice most: "For your work you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them," Jakoub told us.
Here I finally figured out why we're screwing up all the definitions and rules that we're combining with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines we're often seeing a whole different thing.
Not to mention the fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist must have more outfit options than the number of photographs he needs to take.
For example, for a fashion review on 10 pages (equivalent to 10 items), I must be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that the subject of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with others quite differently than in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often imagery and style are half successful.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a striking round, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards stylist services in the Czech Republic is still quite cold.
Even well-known people often think it's too much (and believe that it's enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we have to expect them to call us another size (less) than they really are.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids have ever written anything about something that's famous for getting fatter/bader, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that the stylist’s lack of fashion skills and ability to pick up a suit.
Our work consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress; therefore it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to distort them or to hold on to their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw out her entire wardrobe, telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can praise, and advise what you can wear with them," said Mario.
He also showed us that he had to place his work bag specifically.
It's the bag you tie around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky rollers or English pins, there must be a nylon thread (the stylists use it when taking pictures of certain items, such as a bag or hat), special clips to attach the cloth on the back if the clothes are too large (shells and similar items are prohibited because they are wearing clothes) or a sewing kit.
To distract ourselves from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned the right way to put on the shoes.
Even in a studio where the floor is smooth, the postpartums can get damaged - let alone the pictures on the street.
And here's a sticker.
You don't have to touch the shoes with scissors so you don't mess them up.
This requires true skill.
I was glad that Mario commended me for my work.
Those skills didn't come to mind.
It's only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend.
I'm beginning to realize that being a professional stylist isn't as easy as talking.
V Need for Speed: An escape takes place in America.
Overview
What should have been a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and reckless mistakes.
The ambitions were met to a certain extent, but that was not important, since no one clearly wanted to do any extra work.
There was great hope until the release of the new version with the title "Friend" subtitle.
It was expected that it would move the previous series of the Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions indicated that playing would take a decent place in the racing genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, it is very different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is that there are a few unnecessary mistakes that have been in this series for several years.
So it's not really a mistake, it's an unexplained statement from the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You're a part of a story whose main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You're sitting in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The march consists of 10 stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes its course, separate stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there's no feeling that the same thing happens all the time.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, it is a pleasure to see some of the routes.
Still, the game does not give rise to strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or in the snowy mountains, it is pleasant.
In addition, the races are sometimes rekindled by unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you are caught in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under an avalanche.
Some races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you are trying to outrun several rivals (usually a regular race); then you are trying to improve time (a standard race with a second meter); or you are competing with one opponent.
Among other things, from time to time, you encounter a police force that makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation, where most of the time Jack's running away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's no big deal.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you could expect (just three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game because it's not boring; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The racing model follows previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but that is not an inadequacy.
If you're looking for real life imitation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although there are better options in the market.
So far, so good.
However, after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model isn't that good.
You don't expect such a game to change and clash, but if you don't have any idea of a collision with an object, how your car behaves, something's wrong.
Usually, by bending or passing by cars in a dense stream, you sometimes have a slight touch on another car, but sometimes in a relatively similar situation, your car starts to derail.
Or it's broken.
It's not really important because of the remission system, but that's enough to spoil the fun.
The restarts are so arranged that if you break or leave the route far away, the game will bring you back to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't rely on it completely.
There are times when restarts are not enough, and you have to learn to know a certain section of the race.
An important lack of play is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to go in a certain way, otherwise you just won't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you come first, fifth, five seconds sooner or later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent passing easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you are in the opposite direction, the cars are already in a position that you either need to move around or drop the speed.
It doesn't matter when you're next to them; everything's so arranged that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of time, the same rival chases you in the same place.
It's particularly obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you in spite of anything.
The thing is, when he's coming in front of you, he's making your review worse, which leads to one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand an attempt to make the game more interesting and nutritious, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get annoyed quickly.
It's a pity that despite the simple driving pattern, the game is busy and sometimes so saturated with events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
No matter what you don't miss, the concept of 50 unique routes, the sequence of races or anything else.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to track the fuel along the way, because it's the ones your car can change, even though in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for straight sections of the road; and exotic super-sporters for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain routes.
The main mode of the story mode is closely linked to the challenge mode mode; it is a race on the individual plots that you will recognize on the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and points common to the challenges and story regimes.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving levels, starting with cars and ending with profiles.
In addition, the profile is related to Autolog online, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players and provides communication with the public.
Here's another flaw that's difficult to understand; this is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into a tunnel subway (let's take it this way) where you run down the tracks in the dark (let's say so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's take it this way) when suddenly a subway train strikes you to turn your car into a chest of scrap metal.
For a few days, our editorial discussed whether, at the time of the creation of the game, no one thought for a second, or its creators really thought of us as such.
The technical composition of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although it is regrettable that, at some critical points, the quality of the writing is sometimes quite severe, the quality of the writing is declining.
This is particularly true of accidents involving a large number of participants, where a good record would not be particularly helpful to you either.
Sound's fine; sound's a lover's sound.
In order to please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack 'composed compositions from different styles'; but hardly many people buy the game because of its music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: Running pretty messy.
If the game were to avoid manifestly unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Run is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves the feeling of inadequacy.
Of course, it's a good pleasure, but be prepared to see the flaws blind you like a searchlight at the airport.

Ambassador to the EU Vicinova:
Czechs have a reputation for not being friendly and skeptic with regard to the euro.
“The Treaty of Lisbon has caused considerable disagreement between individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect there to be such a violent war."
“It will take five or six years before the situation is stabilized, calmed down, and all the players will get used to their new roles”, Ambassador Milena Vicenova of the EU strongly began his lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She proved how she adhered to her motto “A Clear and Open About Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and their relations so simple and understandable that many lecturers from the KU Faculty of Law would be envious.
Moreover, Vicinova commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
“At first the critics said that he was an ordinary gray office mouse, which could not play any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role.”
"He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven participating countries at the same time, who is very good at communicating with them, and who has a clear idea of which side the EU needs to develop."
She explained her new position as international relations and security representative as the answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?"; that is, how important is the step towards unification and transparency of the Union's policies with regard to countries such as China or India.
No one's gonna ban our cheeses.
The evaluation continued to focus on a key programme for the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success in the past year.
The Czechs were dealing with the impending financial crisis; they overcame the crisis and organized the East Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at the time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Currently, Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing resignation.
In addition, a new seven-year budget for the EU needs to be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and cost-effective, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and which ones would be smaller; all of these issues would be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: Europe, Understanding Language.
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How citizens can understand that in Brussels people do not try to sell curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties.'
It is also going to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
A Multispeed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs consider Euro skeptics; as well as people who are more negative than the positive sides of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that this is the fault of several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful presidency of the Czech Republic, it noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Trust that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we join a Slovak, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what about the assembly, again the Visegrad Group?" and he's not happy about it.
In the future, the Vícenova Union looks forward mainly to new strict rules for the budgetary policies of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speeder, if not a more realistic Europe.
"We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it has been said that the countries that want to unite, while those who do not want to, may stay away.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; this will be a truly two-speed Europe”, Vicinov expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in promoting the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all the participating countries and not only Eurozone members.
Brand history:
IBM's founder comes into existence in the second century.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest is likely to be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was founded by its first boss, the dreamer, Thomas J. Watson, the oldest.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could easily be solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a stamp around which the life of a future giant (also called his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her original values, although she was not afraid to change everything around her.
Over the first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," said the current manager of Samuel J. Palmizano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care, just as Batja in the Czech Republic, IMB staff were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniform and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship between IBM and consumers is equally advanced.
From the very beginning, the company has been using brilliantly talented people, one of the world's first companies to eliminate all discrimination, which has given it a great choice.
It is consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan that will replace Palmisano, a woman in Virginia, Rometti, next year.
She worked for IBM for thirty years; she is currently a Sales, Marketing and Development Director.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, which have generated many future innovations.
It is not surprising that many ideas work around half a million people in the company.
Organization with a good reputation
The firm's strong position in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
“From the outset, IBM was rather an organization than a technology company,” said Professor Harvard Business School economist and author of the IBM book Rosebeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds George Colony from Forrester Research consulting company.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between going out and creating a market.
In a hundred years, IBM, or Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of his logo, became one of the world's largest companies.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnologies.
It holds the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, five of which received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, ATMs, bank cards, financial swaps, barcodes and diskettes.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (first-largest from Apple) and ransacked Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all of her products came from buyers' taste and entered the era. For example, IBM failed its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by moving forward, you cannot be emotionally tied to the past," said Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM's easy to lay the groundwork on several platforms -- if they don't work, she refuses them.
This differs, for example, from its rival Microsoft, who is based and experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM's main income is derived from services, and about one fifth in each case comes from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, with less than twice as much capital, she was the strongest supplier of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, while it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued its investment even after 2008, when the current economic crisis was first struck by the world for the first time.
IBM followed the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have caused no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM's stock price has risen by a record 120 per cent; the net earnings of the company have steadily increased.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM history: from cheese knife to space flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name was "Corporation of Calculation, Tabulation, Recording" quite difficult.
She took the name IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The basis for the future IBM was based on a merger of four companies, whose history begins in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies such as legendary "table hours", i.e. clocks that set the time for staff to come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who was also the head of the Board of Trustees of the company prior to 1930.
Flint hired Competitor Director Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The manager then placed IBM's founder in the shadow of Watson's ideas as a foundation for corporate culture and individuality.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as clear as it is from the name, beginning with the production and sale of various equipment for the business, from raw knives and meat cuts to cashews.
In the first four years, Watson’s leadership doubled to nine million dollars, and a massive expansion of the company across continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his seat in the director's chair was occupied by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and established the first language of programming.
In the 1960s, both IBM personnel and computers helped NASA to control space flights to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 to fly a man to the Moon.
In the meantime, in 1964 IBM developed its first computer family, IBM Line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, known as IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, while buying a PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high-valued services.
In the last three years, IBM has made great progress with its concept of Smarter Planet.
Its objective is to use technology wisely in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently presented a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at the same time, IBM founded its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ also manages the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of central and eastern Europe is located in Prague, where there is also a research group at the world level dealing with speech recognition.
Rihtarzhova for his faithless man:
Yvette, leave the fool alone, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzov (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtarge, 53, became the bodyguard and lover of Yves Bartoshova, 45, Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has defined clear rules for her future life.
"Peppa can come home, but not as my partner," Rihtarzov explained.
When Darina Richtarzov provided blood in her home during the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Yvette to leave Rjican 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
Some time later, Darina gave up, pretending to be at peace with her husband's novel; and now she finally apologized to him.
I don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Richtarge and Bartoshova ever break up, his wife won't take him with her arms open.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will expel him."
"Unless he finishes his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a man with whom I am bound," Rihtarzov said, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists only on mutual similarities.
As long as Joseph doesn't mind his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yves, I'm not going to change that."
"My wife decided to leave her marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our alliance is still in operation; I am in charge of repairs, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly well, but we don't share the bed anymore," said the Richterge of the Blesk Journal.
He claims that if Richtarzov finds new love, he won't interfere with it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has, or who she has.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yves and I have full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Bad Women's Habits: Are they affecting you?
When you ask men to call some typical bad women's habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines that describe a few female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains that you go shopping all the time?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping in big sales?
If so, your shopping may be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping somehow.
And yet, who of you will refuse to take walks in the clothing stores in search of the ideally seated clothes and to do them in the fads?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it could be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Eternal discontent
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to drop at least five kilograms--maybe I'm starting to do gymnastics?"
"Is she still drawing you to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you're part of a group of women mixed up in your appearance.
Not that you have to stop following yourself, but in a literal way, many men have an allergy to constant complaints by a partner in his appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more complaints occur, the more women annoy them.
What matters most is order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Moose glass, vacuum cleaners, sex Myka, dust-preservation, bath cleaners, at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for coming to a clean cafe in dirty boots; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on the window panes in a living room that was so difficult to clean?
If you suffer from this “deviation, ” try to realize that it is not right to fall into extremes; and that order and cleanliness should not be in your family’s place.
A harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as your family.
Desiring to Command
"Bloody underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"The wet plates for the dishes shall not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them that often...
Pantographs
Some women like to gossip, insult, and prey on others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, who, how, and why.
From time to time, I'm sure we're all spoiled.
Let's be honest, it's the very nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossipists, women who often gossip and despise others, and they, especially in the female working group, pose a great danger to their environment.
Jagra and Vorachek's successful transmissions helped Philly win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transmissions of Hockey Attacking Jaromir Jagra helped Philly beat 5:3 on the Queen's ice. He again became the most effective Czech player.
In both cases, Claude Jiro used the experience of a thirty - nine - year - old star; he added another gear and was declared the best gamer.
The two successful tournaments also belonged to a team player with Yakubu Voracek Jagr.
After the match, Jag told foreign journalists that he had foretold a wonderful evening for George.
"I told him before the game that he'd kill a het-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," Jag explained, after what he did to George, he scored a goal at the first opportunity that Flayers gave him.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a Czech trail.
The closing Harrikins Vorachek took over the Shiba and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who killed between the circles.
One second before the first interruption of the home game, Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with numerous advantages, but at the beginning of the second time, Flayers was again led.
Especially Jiro.
After Jagra’s successful delivery, he scored a third goal; then his impact was turned into Wayne Simmonds’ fourth goal.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best league player, but he's definitely getting into three of the best," said Jagr, commending his center man.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years at the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," Jag added.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruut and the Dwyer Penalti, narrowing the gap to one goal.
Further complications prevented Matt Reed from widening the gap to two points.
"Pronger acted well in our area."
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reed moved to the far end."
"I was aiming for him and glad it worked," Voracek described his impression of the last goal match.
The victory led Philadelphia first in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the Montreal Czech team Jaroslav Spaček did not complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to the trauma of the upper body.
Together with an experienced defender, the Canadians lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalts.
Thomas Plecanic couldn't kill during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was grieved by a large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defense attorneys.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"Whatever it is, we can't do anything about it, we just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"A substitute for a replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck from our zone."
"What was our weak side," added P.K. Subban
After the Thirty Attacks of the Onjay Pavletz Czech Golicker helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The naked Jets, who interrupted a five - point series of defeats, were killed by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five public tourist agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čekok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies at that time mostly sold tours to the socialist bloc countries.
Czech tourists were thus on their way to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Soci, Crime on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav regime then returned to the West, resulting in significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual visits to socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel by himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was needed; otherwise, individual travel was not possible.
At the time, travel agencies offered to travel west, but they had to stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
The currency permit was necessary for travel to the West, not given to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for travel to the West without a currency permit.
Most frequent vacations were held at home, resulting in a large number of cottages and summer homes, and this habit continues today.
Since 1989, Czech tourism has thus survived the present revolution.
While prior to 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that, until 1989, we were unable to attend Croatia ' s most popular present because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to the neighbouring countries of Western Europe was lifted, which marked the beginning of a huge wave of short journeys mainly in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't afford to travel to the West, and everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in tent parks because their income at the time was not enough for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring their own food (conservations, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, and after decades our tourists can finally freely buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income grew, leading to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines.
By the end of the 1990s, it was not necessary to have a visa to visit virtually all developed world countries, except the United States, which made our travels even easier.
The next major event in the history of the journeys since the revolution occurred in 2000 and the great demand led to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have transported Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, which will take twelve exotic routes from the Czech Republic in winter.
At present, some 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another important development of this period, which symbolizes our development since the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the need for a visa for Czech tourists, and our country has therefore joined the world's most developed countries forever.
For the first time in the history of 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person on vacation abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
The common assembly must elect a president, the threat of a Pat is returned.
There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Gashek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, to be held in Nimburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on which election rules to follow.
Without that, one of the three candidates will not start.
Jindřih Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Paclik are eager to head Czech football.
Gashek left his post in June, leaving, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong person to lead the football in the future.
However, Gashek's era has re-discharged football between the two chambers of association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite evident on 16 September when it was necessary to elect a new president.
Members of the general assembly arrived at the National House in Prague, Smykhov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There has been no agreement on who has the right to vote in the general assembly, only the legal representatives or officials who have been given the authority.
Since then, this has been partially settled thanks to the recommendation of the State and Law Institute that representation based on credentials is not possible.
Disputes concerning electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board has also not been very helpful, although at its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary, it is primarily concerned with this issue.
Presentations on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we get to round three and avoid the duck?
“The dispute is whether to follow established standards or to find another model”, said one of the vice-presidents of FAČR Dushanbe Liberty, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for by the constitution, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who received the support of the House from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree on a compromise to consider the winner of the election of the candidate with the highest number of votes cast in both chambers.
The Czech side insists that, in the overall percentage ratio, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the vote.
“The two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; that would completely reject the concept of the two chambers”, he said, “The freedom agrees with the arguments of Moravia; it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
A few surprises were the opinion of Tomash Paclik, although the Chartered Electoral Rules estimated that Pelt was more suitable than other candidates.
"I would like the election to be held as far as possible by the constitution."
“I want to avoid all possible representative nonsense, like at the previous general assembly,” said the owner of Victoria Plzeň, who was the first candidate; and in his remarks he was mostly contradicted by Pelte.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believed that the new President would be known in Nimburk; he also hoped that candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
“All emotional restraints will be calmed after today’s expected national assembly in the European Championship.”
"Futball will be back on the happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Jablonec, of the three candidates with the most experience in football management at both the professional and the regional levels.
Rachel's holding up more.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could lead to another breakdown of the general assembly."
"I hope the common sense wins," said Reich.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some, separate negotiations were held directly in Montenegro; but who knows if there will be a football unity before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be carried by Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucheru and Reich to Podgorica, was not taken out of Prague in the morning due to technical failure, but sought an alternative to bring part of the executive committee to the place of the re-game.
After all, the ministerial meeting expected on Wednesday could be decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sports, Joseph Dobesh, would like the opponents of the most powerful sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
There are many points on the map: government grants; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with a new Czech sport following the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik takes up the presidential struggle because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general assembly, the head of footballers Plzen Tomas Paclik saw a strong candidate who would meet all his demands for the President of the Czech Republic Football Association (FAČR), he would not even claim to be high.
"If I were a decent candidate, I'd fight for him and not participate in the fight myself."
"But they have not yet found such a man," said Patzlik ČTK.
Paclik's motive for fighting Miroslav Pelto and Jindrich Reich - to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged election favourite, from entering FACHR.
Moreover, Patzlik stresses that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be held by an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football life.
"I've spoken to a few people I might have thought of."
"For me it was awful to hear some of them say that at the moment they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football."
"I should like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, Paclik’s main disagreement with Pelt is related to the latter’s relationship with Roman Berbro, President of the Plsen Regional Football Association. Berbr is a controversial reputation known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist who can influence the voices of delegates to the general assembly.
Patzlik therefore considers it unacceptable that Pelta become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful for football," said Paclik.
He suggested that the name of Pelta had been written down several years ago during telephone hearings in the investigation of the corruption case; Pelt had managed to escape the sentence.
"I don't know what the prestige of Pelta's victory would bring football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, and now he does not mention his previous statement that he will "sold the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president".
If Patzlik wins Thursday, he could offer cooperation with Pelt in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Reichl, who was supported by Paclik before the general assembly in September, completed the fiasco.
"He would be the first to whom I would turn."
'He's very capable.'
"I can imagine him in the head of the assembly."
"But he can't rule the association."
"I don't mind what I don't understand either," said Paclik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judiciary brigade led by Ludek Macolo, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Paclik claims he'll risk running the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer, he has been managing the Plzeň team, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its changes for the better."
“Restrict the influence of some groups of persons who are willing to influence the disciplinary and appeals council, which leads to abhorrent situations”, said Paclik. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krzetinsky.
One of its priorities would be to strengthen the relationship between the FACHR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it would lobby the highest political allocation of more money for sports from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should be addressing."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go," he said.
Paclik does not consider his relationship with the Plzeň club to be a burden, although he argues that President FACHR must be independent.
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, and Reichl is connected to Prague Dukla.
"It's not a perfect option."
"However, I don't see the point in the hypocritical handover of my Plzeň Club shares to anyone else, because I'm going back in six months," said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new FACR rules to avoid the Chosen Path
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, he would fight for the new FACR rules to avoid disputes over election rules in the future.
Prior to the Thursday talks in Nimburk, the official of Jablonec remains optimistic and believes that the focus on the election will be a clear distraction from today's anticipated success of our soccer team.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to participate in the elections at the last moment before the last general assembly, and a two-month delay could thus be useful for him to support his ideas on football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that now is the time to lead an association”, claims a man, mainly associated with the Jablonets Club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during Ivan Gashek’s reign.
"Unfortunately, the rules that were not so perfect as we all thought were adopted at the joint assembly in June."
"If there were no different ways of representation, we would have had a president since September," Pelt said.
It refers to the copying of a key civil society document as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider this my personal task, and I intend to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails."
"This is a fundamental issue without which we cannot exist," says Pelt.
Besides, he says he's not trying to stand up to his rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Jindrich Reich, whom he appreciated for legal education; he was fully aware that his rival candidate should become his first vice president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paclik, who constantly criticized Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year and he's made some progress."
“In any case, his attacks were indecisive, and many were astounded at the methods of his election campaign.”
“And so some of them are now questioning his true identity”, Pelt said of his rival, and Pelt himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon of knowledge football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national assembly must represent the entire football.
"I would also try to end all incidents, starting with the blasphemies or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
“After that, I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football”, a 40-year-old candidate told CTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the football head would not entail staff dismissal.
“I will need to know the official instructions of the individual officers.” This was his message to Strahov, where the prolonged period of intergovernmental power caused a clear nervous state.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned common meeting, he believes that on Thursday, delegates will arrive in Nimburgh for nothing.
"If the only question is how to hold the third round elections, we can deal with it."
"Futbol needs the confidence he can gain, only by finally electing his leader," said Pelt, who, two days before the key day of his career as an official, remained optimistic.
Reichl promises that FACHR will start working actively in his leadership
If the meeting on Thursday, Yindrich Reich, acting Vice President, becomes the president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association will, I hear, be dissatisfied.
Rachel promises that if he is chosen, there will be a time of hard work.
He wanted to establish changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to address the problem of the Bogemites; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money to football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gashek.
"As President, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national soccer, professional football and youth football activities”.
"That's what I don't want to say I'll do it myself," said Rachel in my interview with the CTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to allocate authority to the executive committee so that each member focuses on a particular area."
"I will carefully assign tasks so that, in each of these segments, football will take a major step forward."
“It probably will not appeal to many people because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others”, he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement had allegedly led him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there's any sense in it; and that I'm not surrounded by people who stick me in a wheel and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"At least, many people told me I shouldn't give up, otherwise others would come."
"That's a trust I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he began with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in the last two years, and I don't want to cancel this."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years' time, and I do not want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, which is hardly the competence of Mirek Pelta."
"He's surrounded by people who would play football so that he's only available to the elected."
"I can be accused of a lot, but it's certainly not subjective."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the selected minority," Rachel said.
Moreover, he refutes the charges that he will be only the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people try to say otherwise, I plan to make the most of it for Moravia."
“For example, the time has come to reflect on the division of the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue to fight in the first league.”
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three moral teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
While the President's Club of Plzen Tomas Paclik joined the presidential struggle, Reich did not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Reich. He has been successful in saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, negotiating contracts with television and negotiating the lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that there is no unity in association.
While claiming that Pelta had been “exclusioned from the process of creditworthiness of Czech football”, he considered another rival, Patzlik, a strong candidate who had something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he worked well in Plzen this year."
“If he is chosen, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Gashek began without significant staffing changes in the committees.”
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his benefit," Rachel said of his rival.
The Most Beautiful Basins of Europe
Jump in the Water
Julia Stanek
Children's basins with universal fibre optics and status basins in Budapest, and travelers can test the incredible water of Europe and relax the body in the Jacuzzi after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder could not have missed her research tours for the past year and a half: without her bathing suit.
She was lying on her back in the water, looking up with a taste of shaped dome, sailing toward the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the basin, and loving carefully restored ar-nuvo swimming pools.
She has hurried to add each basin to its own notebook with important details about the construction and history of the building.
The architecture historian Meder examined more than 200 swimming pools - and now gathered impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden, where everything went, from public basins in Munich to historic palaces in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the swimming pools in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true swim culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in water everything else.
The only flaw is that swimmers have to live with blue brown tiles and chlorine scents, while runners can breathe the scent of pine forests or listen to the happy chilly birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible," said the Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Sanding in the pool and the oil found in the sauna is a healing factor in the bathhouses so significant because, according to Meder, all emotions are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure to your eyes if the builders take on this kind of work.
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All are reflected in the high ceilings, the color plate and the trampoline.
The illustrated edition of “The Joy of Bathing” on 190 pages contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of the oasis of health - and it gives you a desire to jump in water.
The Meder Water Collector found several outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
It found rich nitrates of water in a karst cave (Miscultz Tapolce Cave) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water, in a building built in the form of a bottle (Városi Termalfürdö in Yasbren), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths, such as 100-year-old Szechne Baths in Budapest.
Many of the heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, have a stunning view. You can see the whole Zurich in the bathroom on the roof or you can see the snowy Arlberg from the open basin in St. Anton and there's a steam screen that allows you to see what's happening on the ski floor.
Maybe the most unusual design is waiting for swimmers in Langenfeld.
In winter, a pair of three open shells rise from it, which seem very small in the background of the Etztal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
The Meder pool gatherer did not meet the smell of chlorine in each basin.
A lot of thermal baths smell like grey, and Arpad's name pools in Bekeschab smell so much oil that you might find it hard to believe you're in a healing source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbonates in the alkaline water, and the water is almost black from the salt that clings to your skin as soon as you sink into the pool, which is a healing experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was at some point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit the open Czech swimming pool in Lugačovica, she found that the territory was sealed.
Shops designed by architect Dushan Jurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked into the prominent views of the red-and-white yellow building in the style of the ar-new, she saw the weeds growing between the brown tiles.
One of the sites where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Palais Termal Waters in Bad Wilbad.
Basses have already been through three stages of construction, and you will discover not only the Neo-Roma elements of the period since the construction in 1844, but also the Mauritian Hall in the style of Alhambra, added about 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace, the favorite swimming pool of the Iris Meder basin, and not just because it's from Schwarzwald.
“It’s a real achievement to combine these different architectural styles so skillfully,” says Meder.
Diving into a thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a secondary exercise.
Speculation of agricultural products
Deutsche Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Would Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann gave the working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of respondents demanded that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbated the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were drawn in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author, Garald Shuman, demonstrates that the World Trade Exchange betting is raising prices - and banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The consumer defence campaign is directed directly against the head of Deutsche Bank Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sacks and Morgan Stanley are trading in the same way.
Initially, commodity rates were thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that the players have abandoned supply and demand rules and are being profited from by the poorest.
Unlike rivals in the United States, Akkermann responded to criticism and promised to investigate the charges and said that no trade “does it not cost to put Deutsche Bank’s good reputation at risk”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the charges contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes followed by the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods can decline or stop at all.
Akkermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news by stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. “Food prices are a striking example of the way banks currently act against common interests.”
As Chief Lobby Bank, Akkermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bod.
"The Bank must remove all investments that make monetary rates at food prices from the portfolio," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if it's about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Akkermann's quick reaction was surprising at first, but the director wanted to have an impeccable image just a few months before he was in his office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President would not turn to the observatory as planned.
The abolition of the controversial speculation on the food market could improve its image.
He doesn't have to worry about the cost either, and he's going to have to deal with the consequences of his successor.
Each second would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch's trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization ' s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday, a study was conducted for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
At least 11 per cent believe that the investments that make the price of food are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such trade, according to the study, each of the latter would withdraw contributions that eventually result in speculation on goods.
43 per cent recommended leaving the bank, 49 per cent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st century house in Vienna
Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Winsovski
Architectural history with take-offs, falls and a happy ending. The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, deserted and abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
Pavilion Austria, designed by Carl Schwartzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a famous example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, boldly expressing faith in technological progress.
Pavilion Schwantzera won the Grand Prix by architecture in 1958 for his light steaming structure from steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built a pavilion in Austria at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, he celebrated the world in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and her sister, a glass - shaped building.
Pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss Garden around the Southern railway station Vienna, converted and opened as the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 and is often referred to as the House of the 20th Century for that reason.
However, the building did not fit the museum for technical and spatial reasons - there were no walls on which the works of art could be hung and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna had received a new home.
The house has been deserted since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far restored the pavilion, which was called the House of the 21st Century and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is the department of the Belvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday night, in all sense a joyous event.
Agnes Hussain-Arko, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Hussain-Arko, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career of young figures who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and custodians to continue their reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to host a permanent exhibition of the Frika Votruba Foundation, a café and a bookstore along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict control of & limited budget
Krishanitz was then an ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession Joseph Olbrich and won the competition, but he also studied at Schwantzer at the University of Technology, and the pavilion was “an extremely important place” where he attended exhibitions “almost every week”.
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that lay ahead of the building, a building that had already lost part of its greatness and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problems encountered during the last restructuring were much more serious, and the building was “the energy sink”, said Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, a reinforced safety glass was inserted and the glass roof was replaced with a high-strength safety glass.
The permanent translations of the thermal bridge have been strengthened or replaced and asbestos has been removed from the ceilings.
Two lower floors have created space for new use of the building, a light-blower between the building and the street provides lighting, a practically new building, but still an exquisite Schwantzera pavilion.
The original outer doors were preserved and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The hall of cinema is the same as it used to be.
All of this is under strict control of the museum and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and that would be approved by museum management," said Krishanitz, pointing to an uneven floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite restrictions, problems and transformations.
Krishanitz recently noticed that Brucessel's pavilion was a rough, typical plot in town.
Such architecture is “not always in place” and nevertheless wants to “stimulate real awareness”.
The 21st-century house is in a very proper place because the city's planning has had an unexpected success, and the fully restructured “quarter of the main station” with offices and residential real estate is growing around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may take place, the 21st century house may be supplemented by the second building of Krishanitz, the collector of Francesca von Gabsburg, has acquired Berlin's Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion-million-dollar anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in the winter.
The number of staff should double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid the winter cancellations and delays of trains.
Referring to the internal anti-crisis plan of Deutsche Bahn, Bild reported that up to 2015 investments had been planned totalling around 300 million euros.
Investments are designed to improve the capacity of locomotives and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of self-employed and engaged personnel involved in cleaning snow from routes and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before the start of work and 90 per cent of the required arrows from four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of lifting and delaying trains in the winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
In the past winter, Deutsche Bahn faced considerable difficulties in passenger transport as she lacked reserves at the time of the weather deterioration.
Many new regional trains were awaiting approval by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE axles much more frequently for many years after one of the ICE trains had broken down at the main railway station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay many million pounds in U.S.
The new troubles were followed by the unrest surrounding Joseph Akkermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a fine in the United States of America worth millions of pounds sterling.
It was said that Deutsche Bank had little problems in its home country, that the past of the U.S. industrial giants had made him nervous, that the Deutsche Bank, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, would pay $145 million (€106 million) to settle the disputes arising after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem was the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of the largest banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and led to the downturn of credit unions.
“We are glad that we have solved this problem without the parties to the court”, said the representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not plead guilty.
The same is true of Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Mattz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and is involved in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is fighting for damages that are poured out of billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer initiated a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suspicious mortgage bonds are so-called securities provided with a pool of mortgage loans.
They're backed by internal loans.
This was determined by the fate of a number of financial companies when in 2007 he broke the bubble in the real estate market in the United States.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the ridge of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with storms.
Investors and regulators have advanced a large number of claims, requiring compensation or punishing fraud.
The Federal Agency for Housing Financing (FHFA) is at the forefront of the claims.
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of acquiring approximately $200 billion in collateral from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank also faces the threat of prosecution by FHFA of numerous agreements worth $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank with its headquarters in Frankfurt to assume responsibility for “existing losses”, but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests 10 billion into IBM
The Buffett financial guru is actively investing in IBM IT company.
Since March, he has bought stocks totalling over ten billion dollars.
So far, Warren Buffett, the largest American investor, has always stated that it does not invest in computer and IT companies, as long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed its view of investment in the industry.
According to Buffett, he had to realize much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and buying computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment was seen as a knight's doing.
IBM, an IT veteran, has now won the title "Ser IBM".
In an interview with the U.S. business channel CNBC Buffalo, he reported that since March he had acquired IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding of Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest stock holders, with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM had not known anything about his involvement until recently.
He commended the management that made it possible to make it even during the financial crisis.
"They've done a lot of work," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
IBM has focused much of its time on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He said he only invests in companies that he understands business.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway holds shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Municher Rück), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired a small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 1960s and built one of the world's most expensive companies on its basis.
His way of life, however, remained modest.
made it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct of making money brought him the name "Oracula of Omaha".
IBM's stock price rose by one percent before the opening of the markets after the Buffett investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM calls it, stands on a stock exchange of over $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
Inescapable danger
After the identification of the "sheep in Zwickau", Turkish media have become doubtful of the law in Germany.
One newspaper says "blood ideology" which is now on the surface again.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 resulted from the right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been a response to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news sparked long-forgotten fears, and such extremist attacks on Turks have not occurred since the outbreaks in Mellin in November 1992 and Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, but xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network currently discovered has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"Blood ideology?" was the headline of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be dragged into the law-enforcement swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, including victims of racial hatred by a silent picket across from the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on recruitment of labour at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light, as a history of success.
The coverage in some Turkish media was a disaster. “The gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary” is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish web portal Haber X, commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition Hürriyet did not miss the occasion of this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of Ahmet Külahji's column.
He noted that people had been killed who had paid taxes and their jobs had made a significant contribution to German transformation.
The conduct of the police and subsequent successful raids were severely criticized by the German-Turkish Internet Forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously thought of monitoring suspects in law enforcement.
Some authors have come to a rather harsh rhetoric. “If they continue to act in the same way, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves.”
"This will be the best self-defense."
“Peace in Germany is very much dependent on how the whole network will be exposed and on the rightfulness of punishment”, says Selen.
The crimes in Melna and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to the world in Germany.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deep in German and Turkish memories.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that they are at risk, and the Germans -- that mistrust and indifference can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Do not repeat errors of the past
During that period, the Turkish press condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks, while Helmut Kol refused to visit the survivors in Meln.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the Zolingen fires, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel took part in a memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech to calculate the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he's defined the value of the person with the taxes he pays.
The current coverage of the Turkish media again revealed how many German Turks had since been deeply mistrusted by the current German State.
He made it clear that there was now a need to do in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate law-enforcement terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal in Zurich Lake
Most of the leading risky policies of the banks of Europe are not in France or Italy but in Switzerland.
UBS has barely been in the midst of a financial crisis and has been struggling with one and the other ever since.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Weber certainly didn't think he'd get that part.
In July, following his effective departure from the position of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that he would begin his work in 2013 as an equally effective post, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss Bank of UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was clearly excited, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its renewed strength and made some friendly comments to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Filiger and Oswald Grubel."
But it became clear in September that everything was going to be very different.
Trader UBS in London bypassed the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The Executive Director of UBS Oswaldo Grubel, a banker not only known to Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know: When will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber should advise the bank from February 2012.
And, as the bank said Tuesday, he would be chairing the Council in May, not 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will certainly need time to adapt.
He suddenly became responsible for the Bank's strategy, which once again proved that he had long deserved the title of “the biggest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, has been a very large, up until recently, he has managed the largest assets in the world — and has not emerged from scandals over the years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank is spared nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a wonderful reputation.
At the same time, the Bank has joined together the face of a hidden and sustainable but attractive asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the biggest player in investment banking.
As a result, UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007 with more money in the management of wealthy clients than any other bank in the world,
and entered the world's largest banks as an investment bank.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, former banker and banking professor, who has long taught at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: "I have always brought my students UBS as an example of a good bank."
"You know what we know now, you can ask me how I could be so wrong."
He was really wrong.
In 2007 alone, it became clear that something was going wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Woofley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play substandard securities and had to write off billions.
Believe me, you don't want to, but UBS reported a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to face the crisis.
Indeed, the Bank was able to find investors - but investors whose services many bankers would have refused recently, a very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign fund hidden so far that it was not even given the name.
It was just the first punch.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, and the chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, second by salary, the chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster occurred, and due to a lack of investment in the UBS financial crisis, it was threatened by a collapse, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank had purchased from UBS toxic securities for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation had paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become a bank's co-owner.
The whole country was shocked to learn the dramatic consequences of the large banks in a small country.
Finally, the final balance of UBS in 2007 was five times higher than all Swiss production (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says Bank analyst Geiger.
The second catastrophe occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capulated in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that he was willing to transmit data to wealthy clients who might have been able to use a bank to withdraw from the tax.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unwarranted business income plus fines.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what was always his advantage in fighting for wealthy clients, a curtain of secrecy.
After that, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as it used to be.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors then resigned, and
began the outcome of the clients' money.
In a few months, the Bank lost confidence in both its main activities, investing because of poor speculation and managing assets through aid and encouraging tax evasion.
And it just calmed down, and it seemed that UBS was able to break down the situation as this accident happened with a trader, and the single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
Clearly one thing is that the risk management of the investment office is not yet working.
“The incident with Adoli has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough”, says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: “The UBS problem is that he does not have a risk control tool”.
It is for a long time that the Swiss bankers have made the world ' s largest assets safe, not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic or not.
Swiss bank safes are a symbol of reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize a subtle taste in chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the image of a worthy Swiss private bank - only a little bit more.
Its position is a classic in itself.
The main office of the bank is located in Zurich, Banhofstrass, which leads from the main station directly to the Lake Zurich, in the vicinity of the snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for the shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Sprüngli can be found here by jewelry companies like Tiffany's.
The Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Palace of Creedy Suisse and elite private banks, such as Julius Barr.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
There are large leather sofas next to the marble walls, a large safe sign next to the bank emblem.
UBS knows that his clients need reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point rejected the Swiss notions of banking - or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper, like all the Swiss bankers, he's also cooperating with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large, particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxes are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there is something, then they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, that brought him the first big profits, and then Fiasco, and no other financial institution in Europe lost as much money in the jungles of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
“On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of the country”, writes Lucas Hasig in his book Crash UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to this?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks were merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for little Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This has also helped that the two banks that formed UBS were complementary to each other, one being a rich but advanced bank specializing in asset management in Zurich, the other being not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin an all-powered wheel.
Two names relate to UBS growth: Peter Wolffly, Executive Director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolffly and Opel was a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulfley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deep-seated model and statistic, and Ospel with his inner instinct, all the way up from an intern in a bank."
But Ospel finally relied on Wolffly.
And Wolffly could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," said Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
The UBS officers will remember well the meetings of the board, at which Wolffley always repeated the same slogan, to raise Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he headed the “Tournary Table” where bank success had taken place.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make a part of this journey.
UBS was the largest player in the currency trade and government securities.
The management consultants were, however, weakly identified, according to a parameter called “permanent income” in the banking terminology, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in American mortgage products.
In order to shut the hole, UBS got involved in an adventure that hardly cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in American substandard securities.
This was developed into a large mechanism that brought together securities based on American mortgage loans and sold them further, continuing to bear the risks itself.
Even when other banks have long sought a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS purchased until the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was already in fire," says Bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the higher, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to leave as attempts to bring the bank into order were harder than it seemed at first.
The UBS posts have become a child's chair game and to this day they remain unreliable.
Anyone who heads this huge bank is facing almost impossible challenges.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Geiger's banking analyst already had an idea of abandoning investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly reduced.
The new head of Sergio Ermotti Bank plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact viewed only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
He has been able to demonstrate his character in the past, and now, as the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday, he heads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to return the investment bank to the state in which it was in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan on making money?
These questions must be asked by Axel Weber.
Publicly, he has so far only said that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The risks of recession in Europe are pulled down by the American Stock Exchange
The moving recession in Europe worsened the mood of American investors early in the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has stunned the hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the embryos.
The general relief that followed the change of Governments in Rome and Athens was not supported.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week the Italian and Greek glass were still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems are starting again, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
In particular, the financial exchanges were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 12.078 with a drop of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer varied between 12.027 and 12.170 points in trades.

In Frankfurt Dax fell 1.2 per cent, closing 5,985 points.
Industry in 17 euro-area countries has significantly reduced production and is adapting towards the end of growth.
Eurostat reported that in September the companies had produced two per cent less than in the previous month.
The message was uploaded by American investors to the Skeptics. "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to quickly collapse the recession and that banks showed further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was able only to confirm these concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything needed to end the crisis.
He therefore considered it too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a ten-decade principle into the trash bin and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investments in IBM amounted to more than ten billion dollars during the sale of shares in this senior company by almost one percent against the trend.
Stocks closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.

Ridiculous crows fill cities
Players are considered to be troublebirds in many places, and experts say today that these very clever birds will no longer be able to escape from the cities.
Some like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible; the crows have been part of the city's landscape for centuries, but the inhabitants who mourn mud and noise are growing in many localities.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, is far from being achieved.
At the first symposium on crows, experts in the town of Ler in East France claimed that pears could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Specialists from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in cities was migration of specially protected pears, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly disrupted traditional habitats.
The willingness to expand the construction and logging of traditional trees has complicated the life of birds.
The crows are under guard.
In the town of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west of Jever, Dipholce, Ahim pod Bremen and Lere, there are large colonies of over 600 parents.
A controversial project to launch crows in Lere created disapproval headlines in 2005.
Critics described catching birds in traps and killing them with sticks as particularly cruel.
The architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lere said nothing about the usual move and intimidation.
Water supply or logging often has undesirable effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
“Life is dispersed and large colonies are divided and extended to other areas.”
It is possible to be intimidated only in the form of exclusion by hospitals, older persons ' homes and schools.
"We have to live with them.
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem in cities will not be solved, says Mayor Léra Wolfgang Kälner.
The combination of the intimidation of birds in need of shelter and the incentive to return to other areas could be an option.
The information stands instead of benzopil was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Utoy Maria Jurgens, who favours a completely different approach to birds. "We must be sure to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the Asherberg education tour in Schleswig-Golstein, where information stands provide information about the lives of very well-meaning players.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion about the noise complaints made by the birds, and "The noise conveys a lot of information, and they have a lot to say to each other."
The mind and softener of these birds have gone into legends, and players often use not only the tools to take a look at the pieces but also make the tools themselves.
Conduct researchers at Cambridge University recently protested the measure of the bird's mind at four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they had to knock on the plank to get the larva.
Without special training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone needed to scrape the board.
In another experiment, a more complex task had to be accomplished by the congruent players.
The researchers put the little water with the larva to the vertical cylinder.
The birds could not obtain their prey.
But the researchers gave them a piece of wire.
All four birds used the wire to pull the hooks and use the hooks to hold the wire by the pen and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four pears have done this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro-2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for victory in the last minute were not sustained for long.

Jiraček kills for Czechia
Then Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack on Elder Pashtigu at the Bosnians fine at 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese game had simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded doubtful penances for playing hand after Fabiu Quentran- Misimovic played it.
After Europe's break in 2004, four more goals were secured.
Petr Jiraček was dissipating any remaining doubts about the Czechs for 81 minutes.
The European Championships of 1976 are being held in the European Championship for the fifth consecutive time.
The luck was also smiled on the team of coach Michal Bilek and the legions of Bundesligi Michael Kadletsu (Beyer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1st FK Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been disastrous.
The doorman Peter Chech, at 9 minutes, with instant reflexes, prevented a potential tomash Siwok.
Montenegro's best chances were when the duet of Stephen Jovetic and Dean Damianovich was on the field.
Damianovic struck at the end of the fine for the 40th minute and nearly scored the goal of Chehu.
After the stallion, she saved the already beaten world-class goalie of the Czech Republic after Fort FK Seoul left the field for 50 minutes.
The winning goal was nailed right before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, was not happy with football in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks were unable to play better than at 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is now little doubt that Gus Hiddink will now release a seat on the third-place team's bench in 2002, Croatians will be in the final tour of Europe for the fourth time.
The Turks were almost able to start their eyes on 31,000 spectators at Maximimir Stadium.
Seljuk Inan’s seventh-minute strike took place, and Kazim, the attacker, was unable to pull the ball into the net.
Croatia has since woke up and has increasingly taken control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued their game in excellent shape.
The Bundesligi legions Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Ayntracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukich of the Wulfsburg team, who took the place of Ivan Perisich of Dortmund for 62 minutes.
Trapattons coming on Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro withdrawal since Germany in 1988.

Constantine Vasilev from the guest team compared the bill for the 57th minute.
Ireland's got a good pace from the start, but only for 23 minutes Robbie Keen from Los Angeles made the first clean score.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender was able to prevent him from bringing Ireland forward.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of its employees in China in the next few years.
The company in Dax's mailing list said on Thursday that it was going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
“We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people” said Bill McDermott, one of SAP executives, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.

“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth, building on information in China.”
Mass killings - human dimension
The strained and very good new book by Peter Englund, Beauty and Grief: Personal History of World War I, begins with a long list of actors from whom the heart is dying.
Here is the advice to read further: Use this page carefully and as a bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund is told, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon when, like one of these men and women, you get off the road and you get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he wrote right now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "work on anti-history."
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, hunting journalists or tactics and combat techniques.
It's not so much a book about what it was, it explains how much a book about what it looked like, and it's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and the state of the spirit."
The book Beauty and Grief combined the experience of the military years with 20 more or less remarkable men and women, both sides of the front line, from school girls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses a hand or a leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives die here like church candles: new ones are added to a multitude of others, and some are extinguished at that time.
Mr. Englund's book - an exit from the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the idea that the First World War was only a heavy war on the West Front.
Beauty and Grief provides a masterful panorama for other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Bee hives fall on the soldiers in this book, one of which meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless dust.
When you're not far away from the canon, and you're a woman and you're home with your children, are you going to stay or run away?
Anyway, who's going?
Hardly anyone understands what is going on and why war should be fought in this war.
"The lack of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "is filled with speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and hearings".
Beauty and Grief monitors the fate of people such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stuttgart, a young German Navy sailor.
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs, letters and other already published material.
The stories of their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are extremely alive because of Mr. Englund's small moments and the insides.
Many of them are about deprivation and how they can be dealt with.
As he tells the story of a German high school girl, he says, "Erzatz, all the way to the ruse."
"A substitute for a substitute, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He's still talking about rations in Germany.
He describes "the meat of a pressurized rice boiled in a lamb's fat (and adorned with a false bone made of wood) and the tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skins, and the footwear mashed with a tree."
He notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat permitted in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories tell about honour and courage.
One American sees in itself the tendency to cruelty and says of the war: “You feel that, after all, this is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or bestsellers, and to claim that this display is civilization and that there is not a barbarium hidden under your beautiful shirt of straps.”
The British soldier, on the contrary, notes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
"When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of the public," he writes.
But it's the opposite, and it's a hell of a lot like "the man who's secretly hanged."
Other comments relate to the old Europe that is falling apart and to the new kinds of fear.
“Conflict has become increasingly an economic competition”, writes Mr. Englund, “war factories”.
He notes the arrival of someone whom he calls “a new view in the bestiary of the beginning century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-seated suit that sets the cutting, sitting behind a written table”.
Humans act in an unpredictable way: low-level actions are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who had tried to lure sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
“The grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of venorious gnome, which soldiers bought and spoiled at home by genitals in the hope of getting to hospital”, he writes.
"He was so desperate that he was struck in the eyes, which often led to life's blindness."
The prose translated with Swedish Peter Graves by Mr. Englund flexible, but unbroken, well suited for his humanist task.
In dozens of tiny scenes, he shows how war “freed completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People start asking why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as the Great War and Modern Memory by Paul Fassel or novels such as the "West Front without Change" by Erika-Marie Remark, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unshakable pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final, which I can remember in unscrupulous literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he made it out of the book with a list of characters, pulled it out of your hands, and set the match on fire.
After the previous mistake, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved.
The night watches from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because at Zukotti Park there were supposed to be as few people as possible at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all except a few high-ranking officers, the others first said that they were going to practice.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of events and his presence emphasized the importance attached to the operation of the Police Department.
There could be no replay of recent episodes, such as the use of transverse gas against protesters, which was contrary to the department's rules and caused hurricanes to be sympathetic to the public to the occupiers.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to free the protesters from Zukotti Park.
The authorities were preparing to see the occupation in other cities unfolded.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were carried out on the island of Randalls with a view to Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot trainings - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid displacement of a large number of police officers - with the exception of Lower Manhattan.
The last exercise was held on the East River Manhattan side on Monday evening.
The order to enter the park came in the "last minute", said a source familiar with orders that only referred to the task as "training".
"The few cops that I know and have been summoned to this case have not been told that they are being sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest levels in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated to hundreds of protesters who snuck inside before the scheduled time, hearing about the plans.
On Tuesday, police officers from various police units, including the police force from the districts, usually used to control the criminal area around them.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, came and left the park during the day, making one hour of the night the right time to enter.
"It was right to do so when the smallest of the people was in the park," he said.
Rescue services with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The spotlight and prerecorded announcements made by loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue windmills, many protestors simply picked up their belongings and left.
Police reported that tents were not moved until 1:45 a.m., giving protestors time to collect items.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitness evidence, were going to the perimeter to get inside in case the park needed to be arrested.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the Department of Police, said that this had been done for their safety.
But many journalists argue that they were not allowed to see how the police functioned and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with television cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police marched west through the chest of personal objects of protesters, including bags, plastic carpets and polyethylene bags, full of clothing, the team of the Sanitary Department followed her, collecting what was left behind.
Some protestors who refused to leave, dragged outside, soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen, in the center of the park.
Some had built barricades, and the police were inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp epicenter tied themselves together.
And two people nailed themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Rescue officers were called to cut down the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until approximately 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The cleaning operation was completed in approximately 75 minutes, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “infringement of public order and resistance to detention”, he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of department's research police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, "did not direct the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second team was waiting for the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in case we had to go inside.
The fences were placed in Cortland Street, a quarter north of the park, and Pine Street, a quarter south.
The observers saw police expanding the perimeter from these positions even further beyond Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police, many with shields, extorting people further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protestors jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, released air from the police van's tires.
At some point, a bunch of fangs flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The union of the serviced staff of the schools will sue the city for dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and discriminatory due to the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students were taught.
The trial is probably the latest available tool to the trade union of the District Council of 37 seeking to abolish dismissal.
Sixty-seventy-two school assistants, coordinator of work with parents and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city lost their seats on 7 October as a result of the union leaders calling them a political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by working groups to close the hole in the budget last spring.
Urban officials have categorically rejected the charge.
At a hearing at the City Council last month, School Chancellor Dennis M. Wolcott said that dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One member of the board paid off, telling him that there was no indication anywhere in the budget that school support staff would be dismissed.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had notified the claims by warning the Department of Education that they had been charged; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to make a formal application to the Supreme Court of the State in Manhattan.
The defendants will include Mr. Wolcott and the City Education Department and eight temporary complainants, all black or Latin American women, as well as most assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city ' s department of law, said that the city had not seen the suit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
In accordance with the preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the union focused on a number of school dismissals in the poor areas of the city to support an unfair treatment claim, claiming that the poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and there were few in Upper East Side or Tribeki schools, 17 school support workers lost their seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave the Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working at a free high school in Garlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the action states: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget failures”.
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed its way of calculating additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The union also claims that school principals could have been misled by the language of notification allowing the dismissal of focal points for parenting.
The notification used the word “excess”, although “excess” is often referred to as “excess” when a school teacher is transferred from a payment statement to a list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Six sixty-six co-ordinators working with their parents have been dismissed," says the black suit, "and not just transferred."
Mission accomplished, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya
The Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the Libya uprising.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, the ancient dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee should consider the resolution put forward by President John Kerry (Democratic, Massachusetts), together with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent, Connecticut), who commends Libyans for a successful uprising and American troops for “restraint”.
“The purpose of this resolution is to honour the courageous people of Libya when they begin to restore their country,” said Kerry.
“This is a confirmation of their support for their democratic aspirations by both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the American Army in the NATO mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McKain submitted a resolution allowing limited use of the American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the votes of both parties and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut the financing of the United States operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some kind of legislative purgatory - when Congress was angry enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry enough to really knock the ground out of her feet.
Then events overtook the indecisiveness of the Congress
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “reserved by the people of Libya for its incredible courage and unusual resilience in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council or split up legislators, like the June Bill?
In opposition to the latest version, Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee, spoke.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the House of Representatives, this week, must vote in favour of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a major legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by the Chamber of Representatives by Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or to something else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress.
Other legislators have not yet been able to amend their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
Gudlat ' s amendment was only one of the 68 constitutional amendments affecting the wide range of issues that had been raised.
Some overlaps - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendments to the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and a few more on “the control of federal expenditures”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors, mostly the newly elected Republicans, who wish to decorate their summaries, the opportunity to boast that they have “proceeded” such a proposal.
The budget control act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting this amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the term of office of members of Congress, while a member of the House of Representatives of José Serrano (Democratic, New York) wants to cancel the two-time limitation for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic, Illinois) proposed numerous amendments to guarantee, inter alia, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment prohibiting single-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as well as another, prohibiting the burning of the flag.
Some legislators also want to permit the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of the Congress did not want to propose amendments, they moved on any faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110s they made 66.
This pace will be measured compared to the beginning of the 1990s, when members of the Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed over 150 amendments every two years.
But they have made no more progress than they are now.
The last amendment, which was adopted, was approved in 1992, but was actually introduced to Congress in 1789.
"Wrought but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after attempted attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot her at a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona), appeared on the federal channel Monday night, set on fire a melody from the Broadway show "Sun Tomorrow" and said that she would like to get better than going back to Congress.
Upon arriving at the 20/20 ABC News programme with Diana Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed assistance in walking.
The program showed her the hard way to recover from a bullet wound that split the skull and pierced the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the draft debt statute.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, and called her recovery "hard".
To ask Sawyer how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special edition of 20/20, which was shown on the eve of the marriage book Gabby: History of Courage and Hope.
The SWAT team told us about the recovery of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
In a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teaching her how to do simple actions.
They're nodding their heads.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word was, "What."
A few days later, Giffords made the second word, toast, a request to change the menu of breakfast.
A video by ABC shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: we see the congressman singing with the doctors "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cindy Loper and Tom Petty's "Free Fall."
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she didn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband told me that he was reading a story in the paper on the 12th of March when she stopped him to ask about the six who were killed at the time.
Suspected assailant Gerd Lee Lafner is held in Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, heavy, heavy."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," said Kelly.
You're just beat up.
And you'll get through this, you'll get better and you'll come back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more pity than respect
The event was a celebration on Wall Street, which brought together millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines were reportedly stationed around him.
His tuxedo was applauding his stand.
"The soldiers looked like heroes," said David Zaltzman, who organized a spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also the then chairman of the Headquarters Committee, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted it better.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The contrasting impressions are illustrated by the difficult relations between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired by the American public.
The troops are exonerated for their sacrifices.
But praises are priced, soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as though it feels pity for people in their uniforms.
"We are not a victim at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is leaving for Afghanistan shortly.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us like the unfortunate."
This is a sensitive topic for warriors who do not want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger experienced by returning troops in the recent years of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
As a result, most talk of pity is quiet and only between war veterans.
After two of his sons returned from fighting in the Marine Corps, Colonel Mark Kenshin had warned them that the non-army would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some will look up at them with admiration because they were beating up rebels and in exotic places.
Others will wonder if it is hidden "under the mask of a vicious veteran," said Kenshin, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high government post in Washington.
While looking for work, he tells us, he felt that some interviews were carefully asked whether he could withstand the strain of responsible work in Washington immediately after the campaign.
Kenshin remembers how he said to his sons, "When you speak of your service, you must count on the negative effect."
The inconvenience experienced by the military is partly from American indifference to war.
Winning the field of battle is rarely met with praise from a country that has little knowledge of the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was at all in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Bernou, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public mainly focuses on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The troops estimate the number of raids they have carried out, the number of comrades they have lost, or the scale of losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from advocates of the fight against rape
At this week's historic court hearings, it must be decided whether 28 men and women against the army will be tried on charges of non-violence against rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the following.
The ordinary first class of Elizabeth Lyman, 25, and 11 weeks of pregnancy, she said, had been raped at night by her co-worker.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a male servant carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked if he could come to her room for a drink.
"That was a red bottle," said Lyman.
But Texas's birthday girl got away with her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instinct."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came to her from behind, collapsed and raped, she said.
On this week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and ex-military soldiers will be looking forward to court decisions at the historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether or not they will take action against the former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld.
The claim states that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit filed in February by counsel Susan Burke of Washington, D.C. initially included 17 plaintiffs, but had grown to 28 for the following months, 25 women and three men who all claimed to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by their co-workers and that the army had not properly investigated, prosecuted or failed to provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting senior military officials because the problem starts with them.
"Armia is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Berk also said that about 400 other victims had been associated with it since February, many of which could participate in future requests.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case, to put all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, she'll open up a lot of cases if needed to maintain pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence, under the leadership of Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, took steps to end the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal a protection strategy, mainly consisting of the fact that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for the damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine of the Supreme Court of 1950, Dr. Ferrez, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by military personnel.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of claimants”, states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from participating in the fight, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear line of the front.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
Result: between the two wars, 150 women soldiers were killed, two thirds of them in battle.
It's time for the army to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; three others are preparing for her lawsuit.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service is preparing a case against the four largest military academies charged with promoting the women's hate atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of the U.S. veterans of the Vietnam War is preparing a lawsuit against the army, in which the diagnosis of “change of personality” who are subjected to violence in order to remove them from service -- a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati from the human rights group of the Organization of Action of Women Soldiers.
Her group filed a complaint in December against the Veterans Authority, accusing him of discriminatory treatment of pensions from people who claimed to have been subjected to sexual violence during service.
Nine separate bills offering a number of measures were introduced into Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Prevention and Combating of Sexual Violence Service of the Ministry of Trafficking, 3,158 attempted rapes were reported.
However, it is known that attacks are not frequently reported, and, according to the Pentagon's own estimates, the figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred in that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases: 20 per cent of cases reported had been brought to court in 2010 -- twice as low as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case call attacking them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape against the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to explain the details of the rape separately 11 times the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker, from a cut on her arm, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge at a hearing asking her if she had had sex with her friend earlier in the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive profile to the accused, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," said Lyman.
"I thought I was having a baby right now, and I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a mental ward, and when I got out, I remember my commander saying, "That wasn't a trial for him, that was a trial for me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a change in her personality, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with a negative wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her associates on trial is a difficult question, says John Terley, professor of law at the George Washington University law school.
However, he notes: “I believe that they are able to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it emerged.
I've been criticizing Doctrine Ferrez my whole life.
The army has been lagging behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and deterrents that impose responsibility.
He adds, "The odds are very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things change only when good people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favour, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform is over”, she said.
Or until we die, depending on what's going to happen sooner.
Walls have eyes: Researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new person of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Braywich was a regular guy presenting his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braywich, aware of the mass murder in Norway in July, which took 77 lives, took place at his first public hearing.
Although Brayvik could act alone, he was far from alone on the web; he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who supported right-wing groups on social networks.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can we find them?
Easy, we just have to go to Facebook.
“We realized that it was very easy to approach them,” said Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recently published report on European cyber-populism of the British DEMOS Research Centre.
The supply of personal data on Facebook is so great, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the website's advertising tool to highlight the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketing researchers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team discovered half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then promoted them, but instead of showing a new group or dietary product, the advertisement invited the user to go through a survey on their level of education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants were able to interview 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries, without even leaving the office.
"This is a completely new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so striking: right-wing online players - mostly young men of sex who are dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything in the world, from health to social trends, which are expressed in Leikak, posts on the wall and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three entries a day, Feisbuk's “super-actual information” generates a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles titled the site by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Feisbuck’s beauty is that he provides an opportunity to study people who cannot walk on the street with a block.
"If you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to join a party and they'd never have accepted you," said Bartlett.
"Faisbook excludes all of this - you address them directly."
Others say that social health problems could be identified and explored through this site.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken feats on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that peers, such as their dorm teachers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who is too often updating drunk status.
"You cannot solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christokis, co-author Moreno and the director of the Child Health, Conduct and Development Centre at Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify children from a risk group who would not otherwise be found."
Facebook also constantly extracts data about its users.
The website data processing team processed statistics on the status of relations and Valentine's Day, voter appearances mid-2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using information only available to them - cyber-free champions have long insisted that the website should make its extensive collection of publicly available data for research).
But Facebook users know that the website is watching them, like it or not, in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined rules for offline research, online data is generally available.
“I don’t think that many users have even thought about what the researcher can observe their profiles,” said Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about the study he conducted in 2006 using public pages of students in Facebook.
"As they imagined, it was only between them and their friends."
The question of methodology then arises.
Even offline has no guarantee that the subject of the study is extremely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to know how much information is in the profile and on the user's page.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook is two completely different things," said Selvin.
That is why, despite the years of his work in the field of technology research, Selvin believes that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace a way out into the real world and a conversation with real people," he said.
“Social studies are supposed to be about social, and most social studies are still on offline.”
Anders Bering Braywick will be brought to trial for the first time publicly.
Anders Bering Brayvik, a man who confessed to a double assault that took the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a resistance fighter during the first public appearance in the Oslo court.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of the Tampleirs of Norway”, he spoke to 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the actions, but I don't admit the guilt."
Judge Torquel Nesheim interrupted Brayvik during this monologue because he “did not want to give Brayvik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views”.
For the same reason, he refused to allow Brayvika, who brought with him the pre-written speech, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to hold Brayvik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Brayvik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said one of the survivors at Utoya to the Norwegian canal NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but it made me feel a little easier after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Brayvik maintained calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Brayvik's strange idea that he was part of a large resistance movement, the judge decided that he was not crazy and said that there was no evidence that he was acting with his accomplices.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But it doesn't automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the whole nation is feeling right now.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but it's not," said the relative of one victim.
"It would have been much easier if that had been the case."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the theater this week
Following the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some compared it to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Grand Inventor of Modern times.
But what Apple fans can think of as the biggest discovery in the recently discovered interview, which they remembered in advance of the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a sumptuous organizer and moderator of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from “a disease to think that a really big idea was 90 per cent of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of experienced work”.
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created a Triumph Nerdes TV series to create a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, about 10 years had passed since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he had already worked fully in his new computer company, NeXT, waiting for the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley's interviews were used in Nerdy, he said that the originals had disappeared during transportation.
Only after Jobs died was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This removed material, slightly edited, became the basis for a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: The lost interview that goes to Landmark Theatres on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a person known for his hate for a detailed interview, Jobs here seems unusually prepared to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, there are great intervals between questions and answers -- reflections in 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts more precisely.
There are also moments where the perfectionism of Jobs comes to the surface, where it seems to be irritated by Kringley's questions, which make it move faster to questions or to phenomena of greater importance.
There's something off-the-book about the Pixar era, the iPods and the iPhones in the Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future information technology.
One thing to read about Jobs' postmortem performances, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs, which we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things he might and should be.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
How he learned how to run a business:
"All the time in the business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers that you always get, "Oh, that's just what you're doing."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found.
Jobs continues to describe in detail its efforts to streamline reporting in Apple.
A frustrated way of recording costs, often starting with “standard costs” that were taken from the ceiling and then driven by the “explanation”, he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they could track business costs to a small extent.
Oh, papoy's joke:
Jobs is talking about the blue box he crafted with Steve Wozniak, a device that allows people to effectively hack the phone company and call for long distances free of charge.
There's a lot of writing about the device before, but Jobs' euphoria here, when you describe the blue box as an act of power, is contagious.
He tells us how he and Wozniak tested the box using the car phone, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We covered the Earth's globe once, and you screamed at the car phone, and it entered a minute later into the next car phone," said Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could craft something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
The two of us knew a little bit, but we could have worked out a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an amazing lesson, and I don't think Apple could have ever come without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous clue he and Wozniak practically managed by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking for Papa's phone to do their best to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two were mocked right before the pope himself was raised to answer on the phone.
Technology in love (and the cold name of Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, looking for spare parts to assemble a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in a phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer workout in Hewitt-Pacard.
"It had a big impact on me, it was the only company I ever saw at that age, and it formed my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw the very first desktop computer.
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a small monitor with an electronic beam pipe, and I fell in love with it.
I used to go to HP with a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for her.
On improvised innovation:
In several locations, Jobs is talking about developing new products in the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installation fees, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working only 30 days in credit, he had to think about both the assembly and the delivery of ready-made devices.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember angry arguments... they shouted at me that it would take me five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was sitting on my throat, and I came out, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
About big power-losing companies:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs accurately predicted how many industry leaders would be wrong in their vision of the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [these] types of people who eventually come to the management of companies, and the people who make the product get rid of the decision-making site.
Genius, who led to this monopoly position, is emasculated by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times as much, could be the microrofoy of the '90s...
They were defeated.
On innovation as a form of art:
"A great idea from a great product separates a great amount of skilled labor... when you twist a big idea, it changes and it grows."
You'll know a lot about her finesse.
There are compromises that you need to go to -- some things you can't make you do electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts, all of them combined...
In the end, it all comes down to taste -- it's all about trying to express itself in the best way that people have ever done, and then trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists cheat.
We've always been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Makintos famous was that the people who worked for him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it were not for information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having lunch with opponents of the law on health while the court is handling the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the political issue of whether it would listen to the extension of President Obama's law on health, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were following a lunch sponsored by a law firm who would challenge the case before the highest court.
This case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions submitted.
One of the cases on the agenda was a request supported by 26 states to challenge the rapid health review adopted by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists from all over the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, a turning debate of 5 1/2 hours is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle in the presidential race, which will be at the very beginning of the judgement.
A lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law on health should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was the deputy attorney general during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped to sponsor the annual afternoon of the Federal Society, a long-standing group that consistently defends conservative legal principles.
Another company, which sponsored lunch, represented one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the trial.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a prominent opponent of the Health Act.
Honorary guests at lunch?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the activities of the Federal Society for many years.
And that's not at all contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they had obeyed, they might have come under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judge may attend charity activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, guest of honor or mentioned in the programme”.
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to the two legal firms in this case, as well as the company with great financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
“This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code is contrary to the statements made by some judges, that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges”, said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
"The judges drank and took dinner at an official fundraiser with lawyers who are currently being tried in court."
Their emergence and assistance in collecting money for the event undermines all declarations of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with groups of federalists.
And Thomas's wife, Jeannie, is a famous conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not Skalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the principal legal service in the Obama administration when the first judicial objection to the law was filed at the level of the Court of First Instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan withdraw from the hearing on the case because she was too involved in defending the law at the time to be impartial at the moment.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18-billion-dollar flight order.
Emirates has 50 Boeing 777 broadband liners and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, transaction size - over $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order of 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event where this company, Boeing Co., and the price for all these 50 planes is $18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold veins of future orders for airplanes.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 fixed-wing fixed-wing fixed-wing aircraft in the next 20 years.
Boeing cancelled its largest dollar commercial aircraft purchase on these weekends, 50 Boeing 777 two-way planes.
An incredible order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise a total pre-spectrum price of up to $26 billion, Boeing said at Abiashou Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which could boast a much better fuel economy and convenience for passengers.
The price for six aircraft would be more than $1 billion.
"That's really very good for Boeun," said analyst Morningstar Neil Dior.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines own oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have money to pay for planes, but they also have an increase in fuel prices, which is usually harmful to airlines, as it is one of their largest cost items, not so devastating because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel their flight order when prices go up, Dior said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The order of Emirates strengthens the Boeing leadership in the wide-fluted aircraft market and helps to prevent rival Airbus SAS from reaching its domination with its airliner A350.
Boeing won the air show four months after Airbus said he would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which competes with just 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axle load after buyers demanded to increase the load capacity and distance of the flight.
Boeing Co's shares grew by 1.5% to 67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost her election in Michoakana
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealers helped Opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister did not appear to have carried out her application in the place of Governor Michoakan during the bitter public elections, and she stated on Monday that the drug traffickers had helped to drive the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the Western State Governor is called Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IPI.
“The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoakan, but also for the whole country”, said Louise Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after the Sunday vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our employees in the election... they grabbed the ballot boxes, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IP.
IPR ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing a return, and victory in Michoakana is an important step in this attempt.
The IPR hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Valjeho seems to have just caught up with Calderon, who led the ratings before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the National Action Party, or a PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Sylvano Aureoles, a candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, now owned by the Governor's chair, came in third, a serious defeat for the divided and failed left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital city of Morell, denied contact with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoakana, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine were long dominated.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoakan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the elections, when he advocated Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local election race because of fear.
For the IP, however, no election in Michoakana looks terrible, victory will give the party a driving impulse.
The man who is supposed to represent the IPR in the presidential race, Enrique Pen Nyeto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valejo and said, "I think this victory must be very encouraging in the forerunner of next year."
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB Office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economies must “do everything they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency unit by either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “without partiality” and said that Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term recession in the global economy.
"It's up to us all."
“Anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is therefore useful”, he said in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asian may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable.”
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely affected by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowings have increased alarmingly, and the Prime Ministers, both Italy and Greece, have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it can bring the world economy back to recession and has led to calls on the major developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag had predicted that any Asian assistance would be carried out through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- like purchasing bonds from the EU financial assistance fund, provided funds for financial stability in Europe -- provided enormous strength in the negotiations with Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade of India, said that India would do its best to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decrease in foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
“We have huge challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth.”
"It's not an option, it's a prerequisite, because where we find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that developing economies like India do not make sense to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Varshni, a professor at Brown University, U.S.A., said that it would be very difficult from a political point of view to assist Europe for the Indian 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live by $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will know that the Greeks are retired at 50 years of age and are going to go to holidays to sea, and that will not be well understood," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why the reserves of India should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, waste-based enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened with “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
ADB's forecast of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing “lower risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed “emergency plans” to protect themselves from the decline and significant outflows of capital from their economies.
The Pentagon's fearsome warnings of potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, made an emergency on Monday at the congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and would challenge the financial chain response from the Pentagon corridors to the battle fields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to a reduction of $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that an additional reduction of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
“The consequences of these reductions will be devastating for the Ministry”, said Panetta in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and the Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to adopt a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration had led to a 23 per cent reduction in the global economy and the closure of many new projects.
"This severe reduction, which is so thoughtless, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building -- and cause serious damage to other attempts at modernization," wrote Panetta to the senators.
“We will also have to fire a lot of our state employees and, as the reduction will be made so quickly, we will have almost certainly to fire the state to achieve the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious damage to the preparedness.”
The cuts eventually affect the troops, said Panetta.
“Although military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious disruption in the main budgets”, warned Panetta.
“Contract personnel will be reduced to the end of the abolition of contracts and the oversight contract that supports troops.”
“Statistical staff will be reduced, leading to late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
“The result of the sequester in the Ministry of Defence will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world military leader.”
“We stand firm against these dragon actions”, the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening, when they announced Panetta’s letter.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we're supposed to make it."
"Sequestre is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter or the recent warnings of senators to a budget compromise or calls for the release of the Pentagon from reductions, we will see later.
It was absolutely sincere about possible reductions, although it came to work in the Pentagon's leadership after many years of budgeting in Congress and the White House, and aware that it faced a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a deplorable picture of what might go on -- troops with a shell but without a kernel.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a unit without bullets."
"This is the wing of the plane without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers able to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"This is the power that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, ill-willedness and inability to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In the annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panett, he added new details of how reductions “cause significant operational risks: slow down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously restrict our ability to be the first in deployment and in reaction to the whole world; and lead to unacceptable risks in future combat operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face obstacles, including those that had already passed the tests, and some only at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 striker, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone warship and a new ground vehicle that the Army and the Marine Corps need to replace the Hammer.
The cessation of further development and testing of F35 may save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital next step to improve and meet the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Catch the Lies
A glimpse of the last headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
A candidate for presidents from the Republicans of Herman Kane is in the process of challenging allegations of sexual harassment against several women; each party is accused of lying to the other.
The administrations of the University of Pennsylvania were charged with false testimony because they allegedly hid that a retired soccer coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was captured when he told President Barak Obama that Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu was lying to the President of the United States when the microphone was on.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
Congressman of New York and internetexhibitionist Anthony Weiner stood up as a fool, denying his excuses, which was quickly contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to conceal extramarital relations.
And again, none of the living at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who is a liar about his sexual relations with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
History of fraud at school and college -- it's a regular case.
There were instances in which teachers responded to the tests so that they could have a good assessment of their performance.
The mentors who are to teach the contrary are sending a message that lying and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
For one day, research shows that you can be lied to from 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that a large part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of each other’s introduction.
The identification of a lie or a lie is necessary for each individual and for professional purposes.
Unlike a room game that looks like, let's say, charades, where we need to cry "Again!", the discovery of lies is a serious path of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities dealing with comprehensive research projects, especially psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most old myths of lies have been solved.
The liars look in the eye.
They do not always stop, stutter, blush, or fuss.
It should not be concluded that liars are difficult to spot and difficult to expose.
An experienced teller of lies can get to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the mimicking, the structure of the questions and the time characteristics.
I spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and constantly growing segment of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the identification of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are perfectly able to read others, making them feel unforced, controlling their own emotions, and intuitively feeling as others perceive them.
We know from the study that extravertes lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, whereas women -- about others, usually to protect someone's feelings, that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried people.
We also know that if you are treated as a fraud, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know anyone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your target.
It's called the definition of the baseline.
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing changes further.
Watch the pose, the laughter, the voice features of your object.
You'd be glad to know if a person's feet are always in a normal state, then you won't make unfair accusations when you see the knock on your feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then seek out groups of deceitful verbal and nonverbal acts.
Treat these groups as red bottles, not as evidence of deception.
Swindlers can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can set their feet in the direction of the door, bend to the exit, change their posture in some way, or demonstrate "relief after the interview" -- this exaggerated breath of relief and a change of posture when all the difficult questions are behind.
The investigators often falsify the end of interrogation to just look at this relief after an interview.
So please note your object's speech.
Scott Peterson has been known to have stepped down and used his time, claiming that his dead wife is alive, leading to her search all over the country.
Deceptive people can also use distance in saying, "I didn't have sex with this woman... Miss Levinski" or repeat the complex issue completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely detectable.
Someone can use the "qualified language" when answering the difficult question, "Good... truth speak... as far as I know... as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to detect lies, but the ability to detect lies can be learned.
These skills will increase the chances for everyone not to be a victim of experienced Settles in professional and personal life.
Controversial oil pipeline plan needs to be revised after the US threat to postpone approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- aroused the anger of trade unions, but reassured the environmentalists -- the oil pipeline company -- said it would be willing to revise the project to resume its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of Peschano hills in Nebraska and be sure that the project would still be approved.
The company sounded this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
An official from TransCanada Alex Purbas said that the company remained confident that it would eventually be approved for oil pipelines, although on another route.
This is followed by a statement by the State Department last week that it will postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores the new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Nebraska Pescan hills and the Ogalala aquifer, the vast underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the State Department is likely to delay the adoption of a decision before 2013, after the next year ' s elections, although the authorities denied that policy had been involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called for a decision by the State Department's appeal and expressed his support.
The pipeline is 1,700 miles long from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He's supposed to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to oil-fuelled plants in Texas.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but he loves trade unions who hope for approximately 20,000 jobs related to oil pipelines.
But Nebraski's lawmakers, who are against the plan, are considering a bill to accelerate the movement from the Peschani hills and the Ogalala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department ' s current environmental impact study showed that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy source stated that the Department ' s auditor had ordered a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is the lobbyist employed by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, a conflict of interest to the programme.
Another was whether the choice of a firm that was hired to conduct an initial study that was inappropriate because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty LaBell was brought to court for allegedly causing a child to become fat from fear.
The family in New York claims that Patty LaBell's discos were beginning to roam their home in Manhattan, scaring their young daughter to the point of fear.
The Tirad Executive Lady Marmalade intimidated the 18-month Genevieve Monk so strongly that she carried on a “change of personality, sleep disorder” and “strong fear of strangers”, her family said in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Rosanne, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching a car, Rosen Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanne Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell made an angry excuse for a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosen Monk.
I said, "I don't care what you say or think."
She came in rage and began to use blasphemy -- the word for C and the word for F -- in elevated tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had a hysterical start.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBell attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosen Monk.
The baby cried so much that she got sick, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBell an apology note, but she didn't get the answer.
Lawyer and representatives of LaBell do not respond to comments calls.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but family counsel Sam Davis said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family planned to donate any money he received for charity to children with cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBell take responsibility for his actions," Davis said.
"This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a child ' s garden counselor with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López’s rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign financing decreased and the economy weakened.
2011-year, which will be part of the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, also known as the year of change, which gave rise to high hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, growth was not registered, but the decline in key economic development indicators was registered.
The low temperatures in February not only resulted in the loss of millions to the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth potential of the public economy by reducing economic activity by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on the areas affected by the freeze provided by the Mexican Council on Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were completely affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity caused a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters, an accelerated increase in unemployment was recorded, from January to March 55.053 Sinaloa had been unemployed, with a proportion of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, an increase of 5.28 per cent in the second quarter, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19 per cent, a percentage that was more than 74,000 persons unemployed in Sinaloa, an increase of 18.969 compared to the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year has been covered by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be indirectly explained by actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market, in order to limit the resources imposed by the law, which was adopted at Congress to combat money-laundering, because people who illegally possess dollars are not easy to work with, invest and use them in something," he said.
Continued immigration
López Cervantes said that there was also a demographic factor in rising unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad was limited in the United States, primarily because of the difficulties of entry, and in the second because, once they entered, they are already facing a lot of difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people remains and demands jobs here in the state as a result of rising unemployment," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market has become worse when it comes to the large number of violations that prevail in the workplace, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population in the state is employed without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and formalization violations, another reminder of the state's work is presented by low wages; in the state, the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the working Sinaloa was 5.352 pesos, much lower than the national average of 7,375 pesos.
FDI reduction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest flow of foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697 from January to July. This shows a decline of 87.74 per cent compared with $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government recorded only 17,28,000 pesos of investments during the year, which were mainly for service companies.
Debt
As a result of the economic downturn, the State Government asked the state to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos in July to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and by November no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy.
Responses
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez shows a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011, the wishes of the various sectors, including the State Government itself, had not been agreed enough.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa was really low this year, and there is a lot of work to be done to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012 we must redouble our efforts, we have failed to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new Government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
López Loredo said that such events as early freezes had halted the state economy and its effectiveness and growth this year had been limited.
“The low volume of the economy is the result of several events, including ice, one of the main effects was the slow economy, which does not become fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations”, he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that the state must continue its most dynamic productive activity.
“In general, we have found that we have worked on this, we believe that a long-term programme needs to be developed, which will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, must be mobilized all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has.” he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining a future direction in order to better guide the Government's efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme”, he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress in its own manner of public policy.
“There are facts that enable us to say that the Government is starting to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government realizes that much remains to be done,” he said.
He's sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
Five years' imprisonment and a 100-day income fine were imposed on Navolato's citizen for holding eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of a crime against health, in this case the possession of marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during patrolling the street of Cypriano Valdez, in front of post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white truck truck, carrying a black bag in the trunk of the car, and a small backpack on the passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seized was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused remains detained at the Centre for Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions should be made to the work
Social work related to programmes such as the Family, the Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risks being left unfinished or delayed due to a lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that while the work programmes have so far developed, they are in danger because the State Government is unable to make appropriate contributions, which amount to 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes amounted to approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent must be made available to the State, and only the Federation and the Municipalities have provided resources for their work so far, so that they could still be delayed.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is over, they haven't given us a penny when they were supposed to give us a part since early July," he said, "to keep going, we've started work and they've moved on very well, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not made the contributions it was required to make, so that at the beginning of the term of government, the municipality had to borrow money to cover over 7 million, an amount that had not been granted in that case by the Government of the State.
“This happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial opportunity to participate, and the programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to gain access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what remains of the state,” he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the percentages pertaining to them would come as soon as possible.
"They have to make almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court will approve the digital television transition in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals for digital signals is one of the most important changes that have occurred to the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court ( Supreme Court) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which transposed the so-called digital television switch from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes were not cast for its annulment.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims claimed by the Senate were rejected by the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by the Minister Olgo Sanchez Cordero, proposed to declare a decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a law established by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Caffetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and to support complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to therein concerning the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the requirement of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the project's arguments in the sense that the federal executive could not determine the general rules for measures to be prepared by the Government administration.
“I also do not think that if this were to happen, it would affect the autonomy of the governing body” and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, was relevant to the federal executive, which had a constitutional mandate, the government of the State.
The replacement of analog signals for digital -- one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years -- has resulted in better use of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of transforming into a digital form, which includes meeting public needs, which not only has a technical dimension, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These issues, he said, “are requiring the work of the entire system, which is constituted in the principle of public economic governance, includes a group of authorities that are united by the Constitution in the State executive branch”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting and had done so with the help of the executive, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded, therefore, that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of the Congress, ensures, in the administrative sphere, compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoakana, the possibility of calculating "voice by vote" is analysed.
According to the data submitted to the ERW, the difference between the first and second seats in the governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without a counting of 879 votes from the total of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of counting the “voice vote” is real with regard to the election process this year in Michoakana, where the difference between the first and second places in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without a calculation of 879 votes from the total number of 6.074 protocols.
In light of this, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Elections, Michoakana (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Zaragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps had approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As should be recalled, Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Law on Electoral Law, since the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal date for their entry into force in the electoral process, and Governor Leonean the Year of the Engagement did not include its publication within the time limit set by the law in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJJJ) decided on the constitutional claim made by the local legislative assembly and called “ineffective and illegal” the voice of the State representative for constitutional reform, since he has no right to “authorize or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of “vote vote”, Maria de los Angeles Lianderal argued that, with the adoption of appropriate principles, the General Council of IVM would be able to submit a partial or full calculation of votes to the local electoral body.
For example, partial recalculation of one or more elective urns may take place on condition that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no balloting and counting of the documents in the urn; or there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the overall roll-over of votes in all elections can occur when there is a sign that there is a difference between the alleged candidate winner of the elections under consideration and those who have won second place in the vote is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party representative and/or coalition that issued the second of the candidates mentioned.
A general recalculation of votes will also take place if, at the end of the normal calculation, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate took the second place, in the event of the exclusion of the ballot boxes that were taken into account in partial conversion.
It is worth noting that there are elections in Morellia, where according to the ERW, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, not even considering 129 votes from the total of 923 protocols.
His Last Will
His ashes will be spread in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirming the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening, and an inspection and a calm Mass took place on Monday.
According to the family, the colonel's last will was to have his ashes scattered in the Sapalinam Mountains.
Following condolences with other people killed in the crash, Basio Cortes's family returned to the capital city of Koauila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people visited the ceremony at Campo Marta.
At noon, the Colonel’s ashes arrived at the hour at the Boulevard of Nazario Ortis Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was certified by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former senior high school classmates and the football team, whose member was Felipe Bassio during high school.
"His desire was to return to Saltillo, and for his ashes to be spread in the Sapalinam mountains, he always said it to his family and friends," is what Sandra Cortes Basio, a pilot's sister, said.
In her view, the colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believed that he was on the peak of his life, “he was a successful man, an amazing father, a son and a loving brother devoted to his family”.
Felipe Cortes Basio, a very young man, left Saltillo City to join the Aviation College in Sapán, Halisco.
Some did not believe him, they said he had a head around even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to greet him as he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
Young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Sapopan for his relative's diplomas, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life by flying a plane.
He's on his way.
The shells fired at Lieutenant Colonel Cortes Basio of Mexico Air Force, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technical High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and made progress in both study and sports, and conducted him the last way.
Basio Cortes was recently killed when the helicopter he was driving suffered a crash, along with the Provincial Secretary José Francisco Blake Moreau and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05 the remains of Basio Cortes (cremated), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over by the funeral bureau to members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Martínez, to the esplenade of the training school, where his family had been waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Kristina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned on the farm NL Kaderita
A few hours before the detection, the military authorities showed 11 people in the media who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in various parts of the body with a checkpoint shot at a abandoned farm in Kaderita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The find was discovered a mile [1.5 km] away on the Kadirita road towards Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
A number of people passing by noticed that the gate was opened in a village house, whose wall was painted in a cave and brown.
When they looked inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately informed the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and there was another man next to him in a white shirt.
Almost one metre contained the body of another person, a red shirt, and blue jeans.
All three were face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no shell casings on the scene.
There are signs on the plot of the village house that are addressed by one organized criminal group of another, also in the village and in the gates there are several holes of bullets.
11 captured in Kaderite
The Ministry of National Security represented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that was mainly active in the municipality of Kaderita, and who were accused of kidnapping, killing, “fraud” and secret graves.
According to the published information, on 11 November, eight people were detained in the Los Alvero colony and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and telephones, requiring membership in a criminal group called “Los Zetas”.
Another event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., military personnel patrolling the village of Staré Rancho in Kaderajte when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the parlor.
By stopping them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after those statements, on 13 November at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped on public land by La Pravd, who, after seeing the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of secret graves in the municipalities of Heneral Teran, Hin and Kaderita.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
Prime Minister Mario Monty will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the verge of an economic catastrophe.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the verge of an economic disaster and that will damage the entire eurozone.
The statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet consisting mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive body will take up its positions.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to get out of this difficult period”, said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but his tone of comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well mapped," he said.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less common since Italy has been struggling with a political and financial crisis that has brought their debt to a critical level
The administration, led by the former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monti to hurry, volatile markets have established the revenues of BTP Italian bonds by 10 years more than 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after meeting Monty: “We said that we would actively support this Government.”
We believe that it is the Government's last chance for Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monti's chances of success were largely based on the support of LDP Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said Angelino Alphano, secretary of the centralist right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the Government's majority of the technocrats that Monty forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular reforms of austerity.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts may lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks intensified pressure, warning that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday in Napolitano, which allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the value of Italy ' s debts had now reached critical levels, amid uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern euro area financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the next elections for 2013, despite widespread forecasts, that policies would only give him time to reform before new elections are scheduled.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that it should be composed only from technical experts, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and opposition by parties made it difficult to include political figures.
Spaniards have more playing experience than Tikos does.
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica when compared to 22 players caused by both countries to a companion match today at the National Stadium in San José at 3:05 p.m.
While the champions of the world and Europe, number one in the FIFA monthly rating, have a list of class A selection games, Tricolor has only Michael Uman's defender as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish football players playing all the stars in the League and in strong England Premier League clubs were very active in the league and in local football competitions during this year, and they were high-level players in European Cups and League Champions.
It is worth adding the experience of the Spanish furier to the complex qualifications of the Euro or the World Cup.
Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in the zone like CONCAKAF, which is considered to be the lowest in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by the Spanish Sculpture Iker Cassillas, who, last Sunday, against England (the 0-1 player in London), repeats the record of the ex-holicer Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Cassilles will play against Tricolor today and will set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, player of Barcelona, 106 matches.
Cassillas and Javi were declared the best in the past week by WEFA, together with the other player of the Iberian team, Subisarret, with 126 matches and the bomber Shalke Raul Gonzalez with 102.
It's almost close to a hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso follows them from 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andres Inesta from 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61, and David Silva from 53.
On the side of Costa Rica, close to Michael Umana, the left-hand junior Dias, with 48 matches and Brian Ruiz bomber, 45.
Next, only five crossed the border in 30 games: Kaylor Nawas with 31, Randall Asoffa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis Lopez with 35.
The rest of you.
More than 30 matches in Spain at Gérard Pike (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Santa Kasorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
In a collection with less than 30 field exits, Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest of them didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Hordi Alba has two games, only one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spain's leading player, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernández and three times as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet put the country on tour for 20 years of his career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.'
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the group said it was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There was more than 20 years of waiting, but the group said that it was also a dream for them to play in that country.
This was the confirmation of the bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in South America for a tour of 20 years of work and on Sunday, 20 numbers, will make its only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with the Los Angeles The X team and the local band Las Robertas.
It's a part of a conversation that is fully encrypted online at The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica, it's a dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
It's just our second visit to South America and Central America, and it's still going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask because there is some commitment to the group; fans live in tension the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, refer to it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 weeks have been held.
We've done some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope that this brings us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungleing with regard to these two things, Costa Rica, one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surf friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always ride surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these are great places for surfing, that's how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
On a tour, you could say that you've done a great show with lots of songs.
What did you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show of possible songs with a variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How do you do that?
I think it's partly because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting for us, and so, I think, makes it more interesting for people.
You've been doing this tour for 20 years.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us have ever imagined that we're going to be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We rejoice in our success, and we are thrilled that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world where we've always wanted to go.
It all works out very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a large part of a flowering granite?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great groups.
We're good friends with Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from one town appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear in one town at a time.
We are also proud to be part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with all of them and to us it was an honor to be part of the sound of Seattle that came along.
It is also very strange that your group remains together for such a long time.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, much longer than many groups.
First of all, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second of all, we take care of others.
We are all very close friends, and thanks to this, we have also opened up the musical roads that give everyone the freedom of the experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't be better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy; but thanks to your success, you were able to do everything you wanted.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We take care not to be on tour too long, because it's easy to get into this big game and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what made it, not deciding to be famous and rock star, what none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at first it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years, and we haven't released a single album until Andy's death.
There were many disappointments because it took so long, and most importantly, we still have close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or I see a photograph, I think about the amazing person Andy was, and as he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of friends.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us some videos, and it was a group that we liked the most, so we can't wait to see that Las Robertas can offer us a lively offer, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you always change the words at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Eddy Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's using the first one that comes to his head.
Who influenced you like a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Giser Butler, John Entvisl, CJ Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so much I can talk about the bass players I love all day.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the border still, despite being out of style?
I think we're all feeling a little bit detached from the word capillaries.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone who showed up at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's great, because it's music that I should listen to, and teams like Mudhoney are now making music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting because, I think, there are a few songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breakfast that are considered very dark, although they can sound a little positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, and these songs were very dark.
I think that when you're growing up, and in your life there was some kind of trauma and you lost a family member or a friend, these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that to me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Ex-President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a state hospital, a family doctor reported to him for a survey of the loss of muscle strength in the legs.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which led to his operation four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fuhimori will be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Agina said that he believed that Fuhimori should be a candidate for humanitarian pardon; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew that he was innocent.
He carried four cancers into his tongue, lost 18 kilograms of other diseases, such as severe erosive gastritis, intestinal cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and foot problems, the doctor said.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the Police National Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing 25 people by means of an army destruction unit that operated secretly during the first years of his reign.
Muhika is going to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, headed by President José Muhika of Uruguay and consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive this Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Muhika will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important point of the extensive plan of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalahara will be “a welcome exchange of information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika seeks the support of Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens at a G20 meeting in the French city of Canna.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax havens, a statement which provoked Uruguay's protest and a response to his Ambassador's consultations in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing since November in the G20, a group established from the most developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried to expedite tax-sharing agreements in recent years in order to leave this “serious list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, drawn up from countries that do not benefit from international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay had been in force since 2004, the Free Trade Agreement (STA), which had increased trade between the two countries.
A dense plumber will become three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil paws of Bozer, but he never did it in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in shops around the world this month, has been created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
“Mario, the hero, who has to report on how the stereoscope will work without eyelashes”, said Nintendo Press Service Chairman in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during a presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is the "first Nintendo video game specifically developed under this platform" because so far successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adapted to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land was a "accessible" video game that made it possible to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Álvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part of "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go a second round on levels that are more complex at this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or those that affect only the depth of action, but on which they have to play in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo swings the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, the plumber and the moustache need to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Pierce.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the “player” Luigi.
Colombo guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo had begun to respond to a $70 million conspiracy in the United States.
This concludes the process whereby Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country that required Portillo to be extradited there.
At a press conference, Kolom said that his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, bearing in mind that the Court of First Instance had already signed extradition.
He claimed that, during his mandate, he did not “put his hands” into legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marrogin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredez, both for drug trafficking.
What Kolom has done shows the executive process after all legitimate and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-head of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent at the cost of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a process prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinieu helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was set up to prevent the marginalization of young people without education.
The early 25 years of the Trinieu social support organization are important: 6,000 young people vulnerable to social exclusion have been helped to overcome difficult situations during this fourth century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs for this social group.
The anniversary served as an occasion for the outcome of a ceremony held in the old factory of Fabra I Coats, to which more than 300 people had arrived.
Trinieu appeared in the light near Trinitate Velje in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or to be marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration at Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that had collaborated with the Association during the 25 years.
The different political representation during the elections showed the unique nature of the work done by Triniov.
Following the President of the General Assembly, Arthur Masa, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, attended the ceremony, the ex-consultant of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the ex- Lieutenant of the Mayor and the current environmentalist, a member of the municipal council, Richard Goma.
Also appeared in Fabra I Coats, current consultant on social well-being and the family, Josép Lewis Cleris and SEC on social work La Caixa, Haume Lanasp.
He said that Trinieu appeared in the light at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far was “becoming a good base”.
The President set out Trinieu as an example of fighting bad circumstances and placing hope in those facing difficulties.
"Chrysis is not new to the organization and the work done to her," he said.
A sheltered building where mass parties were organized has been evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on the street of Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in a house of 51 on the street of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building yesterday at noon voluntarily, which they illegally occupied and where they hosted mass parties that annoyed their neighbors by court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there's gonna be a pass here," said the manager.
Scutters that seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of them settled, embezzled all electricity and water, painted walls and left traces of various kinds, especially under alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a playground, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Immediately behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income had decreased by 80 percent.
The owner of the club says the kidnappers dragged her into an unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to the neighbors ' complaints of noise, although she noted that the noise was caused not by the visitors to the club, but by the residents of the Scoot and, above all, by those who attended the parties that hosted the party, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The club owner said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and that's nine months after he "forgives" her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that more complaints had been received in recent weeks from neighbours.
The president of the PP municipal group, adviser Alberto Fernand Diaz, demanded last week 'immediately evacuate the building to solve the problems of coexistence and the general spirit that had arisen with the neighbours and the degradation in this area'.
The popular leader explained that, until summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the past few months squatters had invaded all floors and almost every room and that some had broken into.
In that sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the culture created in the building”.
So yesterday, the police evacuated the building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30, the police left for Montroll Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or forest?
Architects agree with the possibility of a post-disaster contest
The municipal competition for 16 doors resumed the debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the rise of the currently-exhausted Barcelona Stock Corporation (SC), the administration printed promo cards for Colserola.
The tract described the mountain as a large park of Barcelona’s capital.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with New York Central Park.
With the death of the UK, in 1987 the park again took place in the consciousness of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few which are not headed north-south, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The position of Kolserola as a natural park is contrary to that idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as Yogi's bear.
This was so until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for many other doors in Colserola.
The idea of the park is understood by the gates, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is, "Collcerola, park or mountain"?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion by all architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this group of elected people know each other in an elevator.
And this is one of the few coincidences between what three architects of Barcelona and the scientists present say.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Byona: competition suitable
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline it becomes necessary to discuss the “front side of the mountain” when the offer by Ildephon Cerda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"It must be assumed that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
"Collserola is more complicated," says the architect, for whom the title "Collserola Gate" contains a "word trap": we should not think of them as "how to enter the park, but as a limitation of certain areas where we must operate".
Modolo, like Roldan and Byona with urban building experience, called the proposal “intellectual task” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising from the “uncertainty of predicting public space” following the experience of the 1980s, which ended on the forum of “his swan song”.
The first fear is the limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
“Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step” means transition.
“We should be thinking about new urban planning tools, because the current [as far as the General Capital Plan (GSP)] is concerned can lead to real distress.”
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the valley of Colossorola “may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not” as a purely topographic question.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calserola, which “should not be missed by the ears”, although he is grateful for the opportunity offered by the mayor to join the project “from the very beginning”.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a gap that allows architects to engage in debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is something that should be led by multidisciplinary teams (“success”,” he asserts), which should have been created, “the architects should be only a tool”.
Byona suggests that the answer to the question posed by the title of this part is complex, because the rules of the competition lack the general form of the Colserola: “16 cross-competitions were announced,” he says, “in the sense of the mountain, but there is no long-term reading here to see and understand the area as a whole.”
This requires, at least in his case, the participation of 16 contests.
On the other hand, the one-door project can intersect with the programme and definition with the design of the architect for the next door.
From your point of view, the Council is determined to guarantee that the strip directly above Rhonda de Dalt must provide a full area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the judicial representative Red Casino pardoned the brother of Mayor Monterrey in the proceedings against him on the charge of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legal representative Red Casino granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting a extortion proceedings against the brother of Mayor Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay his economic contribution to allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
Following a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Department of Crimes for inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old part of the State capital.
He remained in this place for 49 days following the second order to prohibit movement after the prosecutor had ruled out offences of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadirita allegedly for extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a prison with a middle-class prison for incarceration of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving in a municipal prison in San Nicolas, Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigation, it was clear that Jonas was guilty, such as charging 1.5 million pesos with bookkeepers in exchange for the authorization of an operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gomez, was brought before Judge José Luis Pesina to seek pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released at the next hour.
During the trial, the public prosecutor before the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether he had reimbursed the damage and which of the gambling partners offered pardon, although the lawyer tried not to give the name.
On the basis of record 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and then no statement could be made concerning the process planned against him; no compensation and punishment would be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmakers, almost 3:50 p.m., Larrasabal Breton was ordered to be released immediately.
The serving court, Jorge Janez, went to San Nicholas Municipal Prison in Garz to tell Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hakomé describes the details of the disaster where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (ICT) reported that the results of the accident, in which Francisco Blake Mora, Minister of the Interior and seven others died, showed that the helicopter hit directly on the ground in a state of complete integrity without attempts by the pilot to undertake an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hakomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The elements that appear to have had several contact with the ground have entered into contact with the trees 25 meters where the vehicle has lost the fluzelage."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, to meet the necessary requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that studies conducted in the area of impact did not report the presence of particles on the ground.
“The study reports that there are no components of the ship elsewhere and that the impact has been structurally complete.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements of passenger transport.
Earth in this place has a 7 to 30-degree slope.
At this point, the Secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study could take months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeroports and Support Services, said that during the strike, the presidential helicopter was driven at a cruise speed and that it had happened on a soft, rising ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of normal summer maneuvers at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner Perez Hakome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was carried out by visual flight rules, which means that the crew must be visible during flight and landing.
The terms of reference:
The AICM reports provided suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft moved to border areas between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where the clouds were at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
Perhaps because of cloud conditions, the team sought a less altitude and more visibility in the Quarnavak Valley.
A place of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest observations from the aircraft's radar are likely to coincide with no loss of control or change of flight direction prior to impact.
Variance of debris on a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
The diversity of debris makes it clear that the helicopter has encountered the ground under structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the disaster zone, undiscovered evidence remains in the wreckage of a ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that multiple contact with land may have been possible.
During the field operation, pieces of aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground had a seven-degree slope of 30 degrees.
The pictures show a sequence in which it crashed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study in larger territory than the demarcated area near the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity.
MSS announces a gene-absorbing program
Social protection is led by a study on the gene of obesity among children and young people; it is supported by experts from IPN
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was carrying out a study to detect obesity gene in children and young people, entitled the protocol “Genetics of Child Obesity and Adolescence”, which would provide an estimate of signs of excess weight.
In his statement, the Head of the Biochemist Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the Twenty-first Century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is supported by specialists and postgraduates of the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Police Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (proscribed or not) is invited to participate in the study in the Mexico Valley at 8:00 a.m., children ' s tests will be conducted at the MSSI sports centres.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to take place at a sports centre in Cuautemok, west of Mexico City, and since 8 October it had been held at a sports centre in Nessaualkoothle, east of Mexico City.
After the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children is achieved, the study will continue at the Sports Centre Independence (South Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (North Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the factors and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main objective is to gather three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with the permission of their parents and under their supervision to complete individual nutrition questionnaires.
They are also asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that result in illness, such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He explained that the Saturday would be the anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, growth and waist), blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to detect genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López said that the study reflected the concerns of health professionals regarding the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 show that only six years have passed: 77 per cent have been obese in boys, 47 per cent in girls; there has also been a significant increase in weight in girls," said MSSI.
He said that the validity of the search for markers was based on the fact that the people of the country differed from other peoples in their genetic history.
He reported that on average Mexicans were 65 per cent descendants of American Indians, 30 per cent of the descendants of Europeans and five per cent of the descendants of Africans, and that condition had an impact on the genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that the main consequence of the genetics of obesity is the inability of the body to burn the energy we consume (calories) and it is postponed as a fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even he said that the presence of dark folds on the neck(s) and forearms meant that the metabolism and even prediabetes were likely to be disrupted.
Information is handled with full confidentiality, and the doctor shall transmit it in writing to the parents to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in the way in which life is to be taken in order to avoid the disease.
Krus Lopez explained that there are three main reasons for causing excess weight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sitting life, or a lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using short distance transportation instead of walking.
This is also due to high consumption of calories, i.e. increased use of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tempals, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetic predisposition analysed in the programme.
Asphalt UNAM can avoid cracks
Raphael Errera, a UNAM chemical researcher, developed a modified bitumen polymer to produce a mixture of the best quality that is environmentally friendly and temperature resistant.
If attention were to be paid to the signals sent by road, about 200,000 pits would have to be repaired for each rainy season in the Mexican Valley, says Rafael Herrera Naher, a UNAM chemical researcher, and adds that if the process of construction and maintenance of asphaltic road surfaces is correct, the number of pits may be reduced or reduced to zero.
His lecture The technological view of pits read in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry reported that the laboratory for which he was responsible was developing a polymer modified bitumen for producing a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Errera Naher said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus to counteract the education of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the hardest part of oil is a sequence of hydrocarbons, some of them a high molecular mass called asphalt, and others a low molecular mass called maltene, which together give road coverage to its characteristic viscosity.
The insatiable behavior of bitumen is the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees he behaves as liquid, at 120 degrees he is very narrow, and at 50 degrees Celsius he retains almost a firm condition, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance to street asphalt is not permanent, but changing during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
A scholar observed that Mexico City’s streets were mostly covered with flexible cover, consisting of six layers of material, three of which included bitumen.
Among the top layers are a bitumen made of small stones that are lowered into bitumen and then suspended.
Every stone that makes up this cover said it was buried in a bitumen.
When driving vehicles and exerting efforts, it helps forces to distribute very well by road.
If it were a modified asphalt, they'd be even better distributed, said a chemical engineer.
On the asphalt coating, he added, the last layer, called the layer of wear, made of small stone, was actually sand also wrapped in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will interact with the wheels of transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt cover and provide road workouts.
As part of the road surface, which will receive and disseminate these efforts, the layer of wear also requires adequate thickness and must be taken into account the material from which it is made.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, were also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it had a significant impact on the asphalt condition.
When the ground is gray, the water penetrates into the surface and is difficult to get out of it, it causes all layers of surfaces to soften and therefore to educate the pits.
In the education of pits, he said that the layer of wear was first and only then affected the bitumen, but the damage did not occur immediately, the process of which should be considered with the first signs of ongoing repair programmes.
A member of the National System of Researchers also explained that transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating must always be linked to the transport load and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of pits.
Rafael Errera said that relative bitumen still needs to be studied and done, for example, bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help to make pits easily and without using high temperatures.
What did the candidate from Valier miss to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the causes that prevented Serne Melina Ramirez from receiving the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valiera won the princess title 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca is left only to seek the crown of Miss Columbia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna was to be pleased with what took place on the rise of the winners with a silver crown and a tape proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.
Based on the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantica won the crown and skipper, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown, but were declared princesses, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Laila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hisei Alhur Garcese (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcese Alhoure (2008).
The question that many are now asking:
What's missing? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite who, in each of the statements, showed that she has everything to become the new Miss Columbia, not just as she was chosen by the Queen's Police and the most beautiful person on the Vogue version, the titles that the Queens possessed, such as Tatyana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Columbia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her First Princess title was that she was unable to answer the question "What book characterizes you, and why?" by Martin Murille Gomez of literary society, let's celebrate.
She replied to the applicant:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of occultism, and I definitely think that a book that characterizes my childhood, "Little Prince," is a pretty deep book.
Today I'm reading "Crime and Punishment", which is a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; I'm also reading the book of Irina Nemirowski, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Harry of Blood."
The answer, which did not like the jury because of the term “cultivation” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books described it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said that she was calm and pleased with her result: "The wisdom of all things is what is to come."
And all of you, please read a little, "Little Prince" -- a great book."
Among the sound hypotheses, Valle was burned by favoritism.
The reporter from Bogotá suggested that, as she had been preferred, she had met with ovations, and she was a candidate who had received all the preliminary awards (Oster's Culinary Competition, a visual vote for the best national costume, and the Queen-Mother), “that aroused the zeal of other candidates, provoked the Queen's stress, and, as a result, she did not shine on the stage”.
And this was observed during her first appearance at the Hilton beach bathhouse and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although both looked confident, it was evident that she lacked the strength and energy shown by Magdalena and Atlantis.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the RCN Home programme, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess means that a candidate who wins more prizes during the competition does not become a queen.
In addition, the representative of Valle has recently avoided contact with the press, and this has been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Competition of Beauty.
That is why two days before the election, Lucy Doti, a member of the international jury, said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also the assumption that the representative of Valle was mistaken for defects in strawberries and fibrosis, which was seen on her belly, but it was controversial, as the jury highlighted her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
King Jorge Hernán Orosco's consultant notes that Melina had the wrong body, which was better, "but the problems of abdominal fibrosis, which were not very noticeable to me, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day."
In the meantime, a journalist, Guido Oyos, from Cromos magazine, believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Caucas was that she had been surgically involved.
"Operations are good, but the representative of Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, a harsh prediction took place last night, it is said that it was the uncle Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for her lack of pleasure in receiving the crown.
Either way, the fact that Melina is now beginning a year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, gives her the opportunity to present Colombia at an international competition directly identified by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will go into history as one of the kings, who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in gaining the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified the body of Alfonso Kano.
A criminal from Cali has entered history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is crucial.
On 4 November, CTI Cali's CSI came into history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC Alfonso Kano in comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI criminals this week, it was time to “defend” Elizar González, a person from Puerto Texas who had spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to walk for more than five days through the jungle to reach the places where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valier and after completing his courses, he became a forensic specialist, where he studied skin training, i.e. ladones and walls.
On the week of Elizar’s mission to identify a man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to wear no more than three days ’ clothing.
Something big came up.
On Friday night, he arrived at a helicopter from Kauk in Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who led a guerrilla war in the world, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with a research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it in an external form; he was very different from what the media had shown.
He was wearing a beard, dressed like a local farmer, no glasses, and much thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Using a glass, ink, shovel, and flashlight, Elizar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those in the pictures.
His eyes didn't fail. It was Alfonso Kano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad was asked to confirm to Juan Carlos Pinson, Minister of Defence, that he was the head of FARC
Fingerprint Search
The recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar Gonzalez at a press conference on the operation against Kano is particularly significant for the dactyloscope of Sijin from Cali.
Many people don't know what we're doing.
Dactyloscope is a strict science, without mistakes, and it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, dactyloscope specialists are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and identify detainees.
In detention, many criminals have false or undocumented certificates.
We're taking their prints and looking for them at the base.
The investigator said that in the event of theft, he had to take a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief resisted with his hands to master a safe, full of jewels and money.
“It is difficult to work with walls because they are not convenient surfaces to remove prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire chain and establish the identity of the criminal who has participated in several thefts”, he states.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man was recently found with bottles of liquor around him.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that a suspected relative could have been involved in the crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle had actually been matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
An CTI dactyloscope specialist explained that a chemical or physical reagent was applied to the sites where the fingerprints were located.
When they show up, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the expert CTI.
He explained that everything was not as shown in the CSI television program.
Just like all the gold that shines, not everything that you touch leaves prints on you.
However, where possible, comparisons shall be made.
Angry People challenge the authorities of New York
Hundreds of protesters broke down the camp in front of Zukkotti Square.
Part of the protesters heard the court decision to break up the demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
The members of the Wal-Strit movement challenged the authorities of New York on Tuesday, when they tried to enter again, under a court order, into Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to capture another Greater Apple Park.
Hundreds of protestors flocked to Zukotti Square, where they wanted to go through a court order that allowed “the angry people” to break the camp into the square, while another part of the movement responded to the run, taking the park in the north of the city where further arrests were carried out.
“Our idea is that, since the court does not allow us to break up the camp on the square, we will break up the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the representatives of the Wall Street Grab movement.
Brey explained that the response of the “enraged people” to the evacuation of the tent city, which was ordered personally by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, was brought to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, “enraged people” began to capture a new park located at the merger point of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entry into the tunnel of Holland, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the arrival of the Trinity Church.
At least an hour they were able to occupy the place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not name an exact number, but said that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures us that several hundred people were standing with tents in the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for members of the movement by trying to act as mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zukotti's private domain remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will consider the legality of this morning's rallies.
Some of the protestors who went there were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at the same time and even gave these copies to police officers guarding the square, which led to “some small clashes”, said Brey, who said that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street movement and forcing them to comply with “the laws that were issued after the seizure or to prohibit demonstrators from gaining access to the park with the shops and other property used previously”.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed, but local laws had prevented them from opening tents and sleeping bags again.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from the square of Zukotti at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out, and a decision was made because the protesters “infringed the law”.
Bloomberg said that he had ordered the area to be cleaned because it was “a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm other people” because “some businesses were threatened” and neighbors feared “for the deterioration of the quality of life”.
The evacuation this morning was repugnant and shows that, deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers, added a representative of the movement who condemns the mayor for “disrespecting freedom of speech”.
The officials responsible for the Wall Street Stock Exchange also indicated that they intended to organize “gradious actions” on Thursday, in collaboration with social organizations and trade unions, to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bouble and other outstanding Canadians, she will appear on the television programme “The Christmas of Russell Peters” on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at the Major Repair, a savior at the Malibu Saviours, Banni at Playboy, rock musician Tommy Lee's wife, and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The CTV has announced today that Anderson, together with the coroner, Michael Bouble and other outstanding Canadians, will appear on the television program "The Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1st, as a very special Mary.
The CTV presented today a television show in which Anderson, also known for the Internet’s pornographic home video, where she appears together with her husband, the drummer of the "Mötley Crüe" by Tommy Lee, appears as the Virgin Mary, who holds a doll depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently took the lead in the "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Shine, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special CTV Christmas show is attended by Canadian singer Buble, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March to Argentine model Luisian Lupillato, who also knows so much in scandals.
Recently, Bouble called "suka" American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York
Japan Revitalized After the Earthquake
GDP rose by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the fall which began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that has led to the nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that has been carried over by the Risen Sun since the Second World War.
The first estimate by the Tokyo Government was that the material losses amounted to $300,000 million, a blow that seems to be taking place in spite of the difficult world situation.
After three consecutive loss blocks, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped to reverse the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent per annum.
Registered in the second quarter, the Japanese financial year begins in March 2012 and marks the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The revival can be partly attributed to the resurgence of the purchase of machinery for the restoration of areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis.
Indeed, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent against a reduction of 0.9 per cent of the capital costs, which occurred from January to March, the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan momentum, which calls for a crisis to be used to strengthen, or restructure, infrastructure, using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan has been awakened mainly by the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This increased by 1 per cent with increased cost of cars, travel and rest.
Klemo yen
Tokyo has provided the internal market when the yen-Japanese currency has become one of the “valute refuges” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the euro area debt crisis and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that gives as a stone to exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, production is expensive abroad, which is a major blow to a country whose economic course is defined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Soni, for example, blame the yen for their low rates from July to September.
While markets continue to be siege by the EU's peripheral countries, the Esihiko Noda Government has not diminished its vigilance.
We must be careful of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, said Minister of Economic Policy Motochis Furukawa yesterday.
And really, the prospects are not astounding.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries had demonstrated a clear decline in economic activity in September.
An indicator that predicts the disruptions in the world economy has shown that the major forces are slowing down.
He then fell four tenths to 100.4 from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after it crashed by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Again Provides a Ground for Doubts
Papademos said the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives would not sign any written obligation
With peripheral risk premiums and uncertainty existing in the parks, Greece continues to wander through a maze leading to a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “agreement” of the new Transitional Government of Ella is imposed on Brussels rather than on the true belief of the political forces is beginning to be corroborated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one-day period agreed upon at his appointment might not be sufficient for them, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy party, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The Government ' s main task is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, Papademos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will culminate tomorrow in the confidence of the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, the message of Samaras does not raise any doubts about his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing.”
The Conservative Leader took one step further in his sentiments regarding the EU and IMF, organizations that should freeze the 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still annoyed by the effect of the Papandreou referendum's assertions in style or nothing, reiterated yesterday that its demands were clear: it would not resume assistance unless the new Government and leaders of the main Greek parties signed “a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible”.
A representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafay, said that the Troika inspectors could “be back very soon” to Athens to discuss with the new Government what should be done to pay the sixth tranche of 8,000 million, although the exact date had not yet been indicated.
In a Greek club, we have enough threads for a while.
Ms. Sofia: “These are the instruments of progress and hope”
The Queen stressed Spain's “core” position with regard to this type of finance
Spain “has taken a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance”.
Queen Sofia reminded yesterday that in the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor to instruments of cooperation whose “substantiality” it has said that it is “a tool of social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all mankind based on faith in people”.
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolide with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “fully necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially aimed at halving the number of people living less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is recorded”.
Spain “is still working” to expand the network of beneficiaries around the world and assumes this task with all “responsibility”, says the daughter of Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “make sure that new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women, “the main beneficiaries of this loan”, are created”.
There are “many achievements” and “many of the difficulties we face”.
The Microcredit Summit is not only a forum for disputes but also a platform that facilitates “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and one hundred million of those households would be free from the poverty in which they were being engrossed.
The impetus for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world “was on the path that began years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Ms. Sofia as “a measure of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of the instrument as “a striking idealist in the global fight against poverty” whose work had been known for 15 years since the queen went to Bangladesh to study its lending policy.
One year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I saw continuous development everywhere”, said Her Majesty, whose relationship to the project brought her yesterday the title “family heads” gathered in Valyadolid by “the poor people’s banker”.
Lastly, the Queen of Sofia concluded by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity is an ethical imperative for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to the times of the boom, since it was a “constant obligation”.
Jiménez concluded that microcredit involves a “serious and firm course to eradicate poverty” and now “greater than ever” by developed Governments should work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be a victim of cost reduction.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, expressed appreciation for the “success” of giving “confidence” to the people “attended to whom all the doors were closed”, and the Mayor of Valyadolid Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city who “opened their doors, which were covered by a spirit of solidarity”.
HDS proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by a general vote
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (HDC) took place in Leipzig on Monday 14 November without major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it arose in the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today vis-à-vis Greece and perhaps tomorrow towards Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, which was presented to the board for discussion, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The stagnations, which lasted several minutes and earned Angel Merkel's statements and several hours later Wolfgang Scheible, the Eurofil and the Minister of Finance, did not leave room for doubt.
The principal idea of the chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the right response to the crisis is “not less Europe but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, it's time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean amending the Treaty of Lisbon, making it possible to strengthen European Union control over the financial policies of the Eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote, “to make Europe a person”.
In any case, it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, whose idea apparently belongs to Wolfgang Scheible.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree quickly with this decision; Britain opposes it, and HDZ leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy also opposes it.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, the overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each Euro Union member country in the European Central Bank's administration according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In order to calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kol, but she did not seek to influence the congress by the “small” European countries or countries in a difficult situation who like to criticize “high” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted a whole paragraph to the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angel Merkel did not mention France.
Just a passing pass.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What Is Hospital Leave Fraud?
After cash benefits, the UMP and the Government launched hospital leaves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to visit the Family Allowances Fund and to speak on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating social security fraud.
And in order to help this move, which has been created by the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also as part of the campaign of right-wing presidents, most want to concentrate on hospital leaves.
In particular, with regard to budget savings, the Government intends to impose on private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of the benefit begins.
Obviously, without the employer ' s special consent, the sick worker will lose a salary of at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income in four days.
A measure that threatens to cause a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
It will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose on public servants one day without payment of the sickness benefit (the public employees have not yet had to wait for the payment of the benefit, unlike the three-day waiting period for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority are also raising the subject of fraud again, with a view to abuse in the issuance of sick leaves.
Control will become tougher and, if you are caught, you will have to return all your unlawful payments," Xavier Bertrand warned on the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the declaration has been somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of sick leaves.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subjected to constant control and political attacks that bear fruit.
People in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the figures across the country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), over €237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, the daily cost of compensation in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3 million, representing 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were on maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 per cent were on sickness benefits, which amounted to €6.2 million.
Consequently, they accounted for 2.5 per cent of health-related expenditure.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to an Alma Consulting Group study.
The average, which conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management site showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a day of hospital treatment.
Another health insurance study claims that in 2010 37 per cent of patients lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent of 15 days a month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
Comparing these figures to the figures of the European neighbours shows that French workers are no more inclined to take care of the hospital than those of any other country.
A long-term study conducted by two CNRS researchers in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total unemployment rate in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10% and 11%, compared with 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of hospital-related fraud is very low compared to "seroo" employment.
With regard to the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 has resulted in a systematic check of the hospital for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checked cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term cases were “unwarranted” or too long, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked sick leaves, more than 45 days 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “inadequate or unfounded”, equivalent to 132,000.
In general, 169,000 cases were “unreasonable” for several million workers who received sick leaves.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, the number of “series” of employment.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tiana, the author of the report on this subject in June, they amount to between €9 and €15,000 of unreceived budget income per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation and thus infinitely higher than the cost of fraud.
Papademos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papademos made this statement in Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that 100 days given to his coalition Government were not enough to carry out that task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme”, said the Head of Government, who made his first public statement by opening a vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the “core task” of the new Government, as the country's presence in the Eurozone was “mapped” by it, he added.
Accordingly, Papademos predicts a reduction in the country's budget deficit of “approximately 9 per cent” from GDP by the end of the year, 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Lawyers Reject the Action of the New Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his New Democracy party deputies.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating frustration, but also his rejection of any course that impeded the recovery of the economy.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner responsible for economy and finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of €8,000 without written assurances from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with external assistance, says the Committee of Experts
Canadians are denied death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health and doctoral institutions work together to provide the best palliative care, and this is not counting cancer cases.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which brought together six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Penal Code in such a way as to allow suicide by external assistance and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to take such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is 10th in place, the study notes that “medication of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death”.
Due to medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate for the country in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion, which is contrary to the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that they wish not to change anything in the penal code with regard to euthanasia and suicide with external assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse of use, i.e., euthanasia or suicide with external assistance against people who cannot or do not wish to take such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed that most of the cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide were not legalized by outside aid.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal.
Foreign suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia because, according to Angus Reid's survey in 2010, they believe that this will enable people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the life of older persons or persons with disabilities is of less value.
With regard to the people who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of respondents felt that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should provide that legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for the denial of end-of-life health care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee encourages the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best of possible palliative assistance, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to instill physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same limitations.
Comments from other experts
Some experts in health legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metre Pierre Dechan, health law specialist, described the “extreme” position of the experts who signed the report, for, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia in deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who has been tired of life and who is over 18 years of age can ask for assistance in committing suicide, says the Deshanbe Metre, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are signs and prohibitions in society."
Margaret Somerville, Health Law Specialist, also expresses “a categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she called the ‘euthanasia manifesto’.
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges, inter alia, the report on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan urges President Assad to surrender power
Damascus condemns conspiracy.
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
Bashar Assad's supporters staged a demonstration yesterday at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased on Siria Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, opposes him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syrian membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union had tightened sanctions against Damascus, and the neighbours of Syria, Turkey and Jordan had resigned President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan became the first Arab leader yesterday to call upon President Bashar Assad to surrender power in Syria, where about forty more civilians and members of the armed forces of the regime were killed.
"If Bashar had been the way of his country's interests, he would have resigned, but he would also have created the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the mediation efforts of Turkey, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose their power, he said, hinting at Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly strict course.
For their part, the United States welcomes the “enlargement of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly tough course towards repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the armed forces of the regime died in the Derya area in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and the firing of heavy rifles in Jobara in the busy town of Homs, according to this ONG.
During the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to delete Damascus, which he said was “a dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, believing that this plot against Syria would fail.”
Following its decision to delete Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers to be treated.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Alain Juppe, also advocated the dispatch of observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from repression, which he said had fallen into “paranoia”.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the 2 November crisis plan, including the withdrawal of armed forces from the fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia Sergey Lavrov called yesterday 'uncorrect' a decision by the League of Arab States, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to recover from the crisis, but abstained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty Takes Time in Markets and Victims of Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for some time to form a team and implement a programme that would require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet consisting of technocratic non-members of Parliament.
Monty was talking about the importance of a multi-victim programme, said Francesco Nucar, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups participating in discussions after meeting with a candidate for prime minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Janfranco Finney said that he would wait to know whether Mario Monti Parliament would be asked to vote on trust by Friday to make sure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with the presentation by Mr. Monty of a limited list of dozens or around that of the Head of State, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervous stock exchanges and bond holders, asking for their time.
“Democracy takes time to prepare the Government and the programme,” he emphasized, adding that he believed that markets would be patient and understanding.”
His appointment by the President was initially approved by the markets, but was again a matter of concern, particularly after the sudden decline in industry production in the Eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister had to form a team that included the most important technocrats, although he stressed that he would also include “politicalists”.
The new Government would have to act until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to Speaker Janfranco Fini, the new Government will receive the trust of Parliament on Friday, according to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that “although the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet its 2013 budget, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, demanded, inter alia, new strict measures.
The Italian boss boss Emma Marchegalya, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that is not growing, cannot meet the deficits”.
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence in the household by the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the “change of the era” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “professor”, symbolizing the “expression of seriousness” and “other Italy”, according to the authors of the foremen.
The longevity of his team is great unknown.
President Napolitano would be pleased to avoid an early election, since by April 2012, Italy had to pay EUR 200,000 million in public debt.
Russian scientist assisted Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran to develop a nuclear-weapon-friendly detonator, confirmed on Monday the US Agency specializing in the field of nuclear danger.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) builds on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, “since the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds of explosive techniques”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to create a company that produced nano-alms in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, IAEA referred to the “extensive signs that Iran’s development of the nuclear detonators system” as “qualified the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well but also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology within the framework of his native country’s military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence slightly decreased or remained unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total incidence of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, equivalent to 49 per cent, compared with 13 per cent of Catholic violence, a reduction of 4 per cent in Jewish attacks and a 14 per cent increase in religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
Since the decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is increasing again, underlining the human rights organization Human Rights First, “increasing violence against Muslims in particular”, adds the organization in an official communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, like all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as serious human rights violations," added one of the leaders of the organization Paul Lejandr.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, it adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
Hate crimes under federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence involving race, colour, religion, nationality and today's sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter revised the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they watch, what makes this service look like on Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and the other "name" allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other Twitter users, Internet users whose messages you're tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This makes it possible for them to recognize messages if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "by a small percentage of users in August" before making extensive use of the entire network on Monday, AFP told the press secretary Twitter Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively quite incomprehensible and as using rather vague terms (RT for overcoming someone else's encounter, #flowfriday for recommending tracking other users), mostly bringing pleasure to experienced users, thus opening up itself to a wider audience, presenting to users something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the web, users discussed this innovation through Twitter on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive and exaggerating to Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution of the “Golden Rules” of the budget
The head of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budget “golden rule” into the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible decline in Austrian public credit rating agencies (Trino A).
Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann personally announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting, with Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the 60 per cent ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay fell by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest of three thousand million euros more each year, the Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger argued.
Austria thus met the requirement of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State and Government demanded that budgetary deficits be reduced by the end of 2012 and that government accounts be returned to balance through a constitution or an equivalent law.
The Austrian Government's decision recalls the “German model” because Germany was the first European country to adopt the “rule”.
By 2017, the structural deficit in the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and the structural deficit in the federal State budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP in any year, and land, like the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to obligate the public debt to fall below the 60 per cent mark of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esichiko Noda
threatens new intervention in the currency market
Prime Minister Esihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new interventions on the currency market if the value of the yen continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of iena, Mr. Noda Senate explained.
On Tuesday, the yen grew up almost to the historic mark, which prompted Japan’s authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold a large dollar yen to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had established a new record of force since 1945.
Since then, however, Iena has been growing constantly, driven by the purchase of investors who see it as a “density” in these turbulent times of economic downturn around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the 105 yen symbolic plan, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
The increase in Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as Japanese products make it more expensive and reduce the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into national currencies.
“Japan is fighting to restore itself” after the earthquake and the tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), emphasized Mr. Noda, who feared that this growth would kill the fragile germ of reconstruction.
Third world economic Power resumed growth in the third quarter of -1.5 per cent, for the first time in a year, thanks to the increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect Japan's “fundamental economic indicators”.
Minister of Finance Jun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Managing Authority, Hirohide Yamaguti, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps” to realize that no further mitigation was to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the issuing organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47 thousand Euros) to purchase treasury bonds, raising up to 55,000 thousand yen (519 thousand euros) to the ceilings it allocates to the purchase of various financial instruments to fill the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates increase, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of a debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, the European exchanges left this Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and ended its trades at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell 0.4% and London fell 0.1%.
Owing to new difficulties in lending to difficult eurozone countries, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Concerned investors are simply too concerned about the risk of infection”, explains Terry Pratt, the institutional broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market participants ' doubts about Europe ' s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has looked forward to Europe, and the stock exchanges will follow each other in a narrow change corridor until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized”, says Mitsubishi Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of concern over the future of the eurozone is a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lower mark in one and a half months.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, falling 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after Angela Merkel HDZ, chancellor's party, held on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, inter alia, for a difficult country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
This morning, Italian 10-year bond yields reached 6.85% and Spanish bond yields reached 6.2% with the same maturity date.
These difficulties, with interest rates in the southern countries but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monty, asked a time exchange to reinstate the situation in Italy, which was threatened by paralyzing under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the follow-up to the decisions taken at the 27 October eurozone summit would be “the main task” of his Government.
Spain was shot at by markets before the Sunday parliamentary elections.
In advance, the interest rates on 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain had reached a new historical maximum.
Waiting for growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected of 0.3 per cent, thanks to the increased consumption of households.
Insee, however, revised towards a reduction in the second quarter, with a fall of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And the economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first evaluation of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings give rise to reflection on the proportion and place of nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options have been examined.
France must build its opinion on objective facts and on rational data.
Now we are 7,000 people on the planet, demographic development will lead to a doubling of the electricity demand by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world's population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing resource shortfall in order to continue to produce electricity constantly, without forgetting the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalance, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fuchsim accident doesn't change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are few of those who are continuing their projects.
The United States decided, after Fuchsima, to add one installation to its set, to resume the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident in Tri Mail Island.
Although the German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, the reality is contrary to this argument.
Berlin ' s choice will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, compounded by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, carbon dioxide emissions from the construction of gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European turbine champion, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas because of the disruptive wind; hence carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than on average in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the supply of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from cheap electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a significant increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illustrative beautiful declarations of our country ' s new industrialization and protection of purchasing power.
The price most French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole range of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on international trade and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France had decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from the export of French nuclear equipment and services.
Which electric engineer will order EPR to work for sixty years if its manufacturer is scheduled to close?
To solve the equation of energy, it must be recognized that there are no divine or devilish sources of energy.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is universally recognized, have the same obsession with security.
Over 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mayal Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental effects.
In Chernobyl a reactor device and an unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukusim, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented force that resulted in the death of tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it has derived from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the collaboration between the security authorities, operators and French and German constructors, EPR, is presented by the project to combat such phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy professionals who want to build a reactor, the suspension of its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to Areva and EDF competitors, clearing the way for them to win leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and prejudices to prevail in a dispute that is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or a benefit to the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various sides by the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinated digital policies and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as “a State of human rights”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which came into the news when the Minister of the Interior (“Liberaceon” of 23 May) stated that France “does not need foreign talents, stoners and waiters”.
But it is rarely analysed economically.
The right-wing and left-wing parties agree on a lot of things.
On the right side of the tone was asked by Jacques Shirak, who in 1976 stated that “900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers” and by the left side by Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept the poor from all over the world”.
The Difference Only in Generosity
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the country by the Ord of the Polish plumber was felt by both the left and the right.
Both parties see the burden of immigration on the French economy and on French society.
The distinction is limited to the level of generosity that they will allow to manifest to immigrants.
In his program François Allland was limited to banality, he said that “joint work will solve our immigration problem”.
This perception of immigration as a burden and a problem may give rise to an electric advantage, but it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing recent data on immigration (People: How migration will shape our world and determine our future, May 2011, University of Princeton publication, 352 pages), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restrictions on immigration have led to less growth and less employment.
Fears of immigrants are based on the perception that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, by causing wages to fall.
But experience has shown that immigrants are much more complementary in reality than they are replacing local labour by doing jobs that lack local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
A Positive Effect on Wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrants has led to a positive effect on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1 per cent in migration rates resulted in an increase of 0.6 to 0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among the Nobel Prize American laureates and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make net profit in social security systems, with an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, an immigrant who has come to Germany at the age of 30 will live on a life-long basis bring net profit (income minus costs) to the State budget of an average of 150,000 euros.
Nikol Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was going to "chicken" into missing growth points.
The teeth mentioned, which were used to intimidate immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that by discovering it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some thought that democracy would eventually encroach on its enemies, sufficiently set up a vote and make it as direct as possible.
In the days of Napoleon "Mologo" it is known that this occurs from the surface of the thought.
The general vote, although binding on democracy, is not a sufficient condition for democracy and could even become a “ instrument of repression”, as Etien Vestro, a philosopher, once said.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinody of the true Greek referendum will have a double disclosure effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious change of policy and the unpleasant sense of its incompetence and non-conformity.
This duality must be considered in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line for the struggle for democracy has now moved, and many feel that the Republican soldiers are now aiming at the wrong side.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums, as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart blanche" for an absolute European monarch or leaping with bound legs to the brink of nationalism -- what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of the blade of the guillotine, but of the implementation, together, clear and continuous, of the choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and there are no more to be listed, because there is only one crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe is totally humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of the sovereignty of Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The governance of the European project under popular sovereignty must be restored as a matter of urgency.
Because Europeans can only work together to reduce the debt burden of everyone, to free themselves from markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it.
Resolved from the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, without causing us a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal by socialists and Jacques Delora, all of us now demand from the European economic government.
Let's do it.
But to represent it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has come into play, is another madness and a new deadlock.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true popular European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Non-contact card chips are spreading more and more.
The World Cup chip exhibition opens on Tuesday in Vilpent under Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end in 11% of global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards), exceeding 6,000 units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important non-contact technology sector, which pays for public transport or purchases, simply map the reading device.
This year, 460 million unmarked chip cards will be sold in the world, compared to 320 million years earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will represent almost 10 per cent of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million maps).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind in Asia and the Pacific, is now moving forward in the area of spotless payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards have already been provided with this function, and 75,000 have been accepted.
France is starting with a more modest position: 400,000 uncontacted Visa maps are being addressed.
But big stores are increasing pace.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million untouched Pass MasterCard.
To get to a higher speed, banks need to supply equipment to their customers.
“Two large organizations in France have promised in the future to systematically distribute to their customers bank cards that are ready for immediate use,” said Gérard Nebuy, Director-General Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But this is just the first step in the development of a future means of payment, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with NFC technology (near field communication) necessary to carry out such transactions.
"They were delayed.
"But they should really fly off next year."
"We are counting on worldwide sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment in Cana from December to June next year.
The iPhone equipment will be provided with a net payment of about 200 customers and staff members.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and in Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to allow his clients to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
The long-awaited links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram were confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algerians were now confident.
“The method used by these two organizations, and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without giving details.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
An investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger revealed two links in January.
Abducted at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocour and Vincent Delory were apparently killed the following day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone sym-cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's terror.
An analysis of the calls had been made by several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who lived long in Midiguri, a town in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram cradle, and the other to a person allegedly close to Aqmi and a sect.
“This is a step forward, but we certainly need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“For many years now, it has been known that the sect has received financial and future support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of mortals and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community in charge of Washington is now putting pressure on Abuja to pay attention to the problems that Boko Haram poses.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people of no interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Midiguri at the mosque, school, and in the mother-founder of Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, which means “Western education is a sin” - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It has been politicized and requires strict compliance with the sharia, and its activists have launched a fight against the wicked central government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists showed special activity by carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead behind.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect radicalizes and goes beyond its northern openings.
In the past Christmas, she assumed responsibility for the action that resulted in the killing of 80 people in Joss, and then another in Abuja.
In June in Abuja, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, coming from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is a concern to date for all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi was strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from al-Shabaab were operating in Kenya, Boko Haram was a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Gudlak Jonathan Alain Jouppe warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
Peace as Republican presidential candidates see him
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry competed in simplifications and incompetences.
Can America’s crisis-relief lead to a complex world with simple, more precise, simplified ideas?
If the Republican presidential candidates were to be heard, voters could believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying loud but devoid of details of foreign policy, which are traditionally a strong part of the republicans.
The slogans pertaining to China, Iran and Israel's assistance are often mixed together.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of moving from the Good Old Party, threatened to complain against the Chinese in WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of the entire industries of their industry in Asia.
Worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate in a complex foreign policy, was unable to overcome a position that led to emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who's at the bottom of the ratings, remains unheard of.
In Reagan style
Romni also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions could not stop his nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran, he's called."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel's military assistance by accusing Obama of not fulfilling his promises to that partner.
Herman Kane, the second in the candidate rating, demonstrated a discouraging lack of knowledge.
He recently called for a fight against the Chinese military threat because Beijing has been trying to achieve nuclear power - obviously does not know that China has had it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
It is also recommended that Kane, Perry and candidate Michel Bahman resort to torture of suspected terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McKeane, a difficult foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he had won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his tone with regard to the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the “boys” from Iraq, his traps in Libya, which brought him the reputation of a weak policy.
But it's not that simple.
The population considered the positive balance of national security at Obama, which had been eliminated by Ben-Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that bind in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be restructured economically to re-establish its leadership, Obama's rights.
North Stream, new gates for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North Stream pipeline, connecting Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to provide gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part in last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the performance of the orchestra and the snacks sought, the opening of the North Stream, a new pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angel Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiyon and his Dutch colleague, Mart Rutte, together turned a symbolic valve to control the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
A new 27,500 million additional cubic metres of gas pipeline will flow each year to Western Europe on the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the Leningrad region to the Mecklenburg-Pomorania land.
The second pipeline should be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 cubic metres of gas equivalent to all French consumption.
The possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met the fierce resistance of Poland and the Baltic States.
In fact, the North Stream will allow the gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to deny access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Stream with the new Germano-Soviet Pact, suggesting an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with a view to occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
In supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is making its deliveries more secure.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project has created a gateway between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already at large.
"This pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, a new artery that binds us organically," said François Fiona, opening up the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both political and economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large quantities in Lubmin, the arrival point of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel locked in concrete to protect it from anchor ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, the minefields left since the Second World War had to be bypassed.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Muller, the North Stream Press Secretary.
Many steps were also needed to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, with no bursts all over its length, no valves and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the region of Sweden, but the project manager rejected it because Sweden was not pleased that a Russian state company would reside forever on its shores.
"In case of an accident, we'll cut the gas flow less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
So if the gas contained in the pipeline is leaked, it's going to blow up.
But this seems to be unlikely for designers who designed stitches for leak only once every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the gas pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot that pulls the ship, for external observation, as well as by a vehicle circling inside the pipeline.
The cigarette machine shall be inserted inside the pipeline with a diameter of 1 metre and pushed forward by the flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it provides accurate information on any metal deformation.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without any minor repairs.
The gas shall be circulated only by pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture called the North Stream, which was entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
Its headquarters is located in Zuga, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
After that, Gazprom leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transport.
“Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas is actually being transported”, Jens Muller argues.
The gas pipeline was financed by 30% of shareholders and 70 per cent of bank loans.
The total cost of the work will be 7.4 million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But the Minorite shareholders are confident that they will pay for their expenses because Gazprom takes all the risks.
Gas pipelines come out of the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy shore packed with pine trees.
Ventiles of 4.5 metres high form an exhaust terminal of gas.
The sensors shall measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before being transferred to the German gas lines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million per hour at full capacity and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Brandy Notepad
Moleskin, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will taste back to writing.
He's got the smell of adventures, the hours spent writing in the light of candles.
Moleskine's block is easy to find out on a rectangular black cover, by rubber, on a yellow and white page, as if it were coveted over time.
However, the Moleskine book, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to launch designer notebooks for sale.
Maria Sebrandi, a company consultant at the time, assumed responsibility for starting a new product.
The block is inspired by the old production technique, the mollusk is a lacquered cotton fabric used, for example, to cover the pebbles.
Writers and travellers are said to value this type of notebooks.
"Moleskine has brought into line with today's taste the old and forgotten thing that was cultivable for the adventurous painters until the twentieth century," said Maria Sebregundi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo Modo.
Good luck with that.
From 2006 to 2010, sales rose by 25% and reached 12.7 million.
We were far away from production for the first few years, when only 3,000 blocks were produced.
Moleskine crossed Italy's border and exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a profile of a typical buyer because the notebook attracts businessmen, students and people of free trade in the same way.
The buyers of Moleskin are cosmopolitan, have broad views and are educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks to Fnac bookstores, shopkeepers in small towns centres, and has been able to get a lot of publicity.
“We followed the spirit of time and this new need in a letter, despite the appearance of an e-mail,” explains Maria Sebrandi.
This distinctive cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently, the brand organized an exhibition entitled “The Round Road”, where architects and artists demonstrated their own blockages.
In August, he also launched leopold painting covers on the occasion of a film festival in Locarno.
Using its successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has varied his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags. Brand includes all kinds of support.
The success that led to envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which entered a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
Some 19% of the disabled are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, 19 per cent versus 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disturbing?
“No,” emphasizes Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for persons with disabilities.”
“In 15 years, significant progress has been made”.
"At the time, the proportion of the unemployed was not 2 but 3 times more."
"However, there's still a lot of work ahead."
It should be said that there are still many obstacles to a disabled person ' s employment.
Of these, 37 per cent are older than 50 years of age (17 per cent on average).
Rather, they have low qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a baccalaureate, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 persons with disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread, which amounts to 85% for persons with disabilities, up to 38% on average.
In short, all these criteria, which make it very difficult to get back to work and which are the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapen, Director General Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study conducted by the IMS-Entreprendre Association in April on the order of Cité showed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and “presented themselves to be complete people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still away from the goal of having 6 per cent of the disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures for 2008 represent 2.6 per cent.
"We are about 3% today," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “buyed” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) in 2007-2011.
"The 2005 Law, which lifted the tax, put a lot of pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc."
“But this improvement also reflects increased consciousness, in particular in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers compared to 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness."
Before meeting the Blue Night on Tuesday (20.45), Eden Azar and Georges Leakins did not hide the pleasures they had received from this friendly match.
We're not going to come here to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
Sitting next to the stadium of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar agreed.
Five months later, a Belgian coach can only praise him after leaving his match against Turkey.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to go on," assures Lily's game.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and the assembly room, that's one thing, he's justifiable.
"I'm in Lille, and I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to earn points."
Left in reserve, ahead of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to St. Denis to finally shine.
Not forgetting, however, the notion of pleasure.
He supported the Sinich since the age of 7 and the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I have always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also strengthens the special character of this match.
And especially what is on the other side of Matthew, Johan and Adil, he remembers.
"Our paths just crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leecten thought well of pride.
Pride to play the holiday match.
Pride also claims to be a "neighbor" that France "became once again a very high-level team" just one year after the injury in Niezna.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, admired by him.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly on one plane with a blue leader... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he emphasized.
"We're building something, ambitious players, they're hungry."
"You'll see for yourself in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident of itself
Portugal, Paulo Bento, begins its retaliatory match against Bosnia (2200 hours) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality on the way to him.
"By the end of this 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paula Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that the Assembly, which has been running since September 2010, has been eligible for Euro 2012.
Portugal is 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a match to be played, and Bosnia to be won.
Given 0-0 on Friday in Hell Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it was unable to achieve a goal of dedication that would reassure her.
"This is a good result, but it entails a certain risk."
But at its brightly lit stadium de la Luse in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, which should be excited, although the match will be very tense," said optimisticly, but judgmental Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 per cent of the chances of Euro 2012," said the successor of Karlus Cairos.
Nobody in the match against Bosnia demands the Portuguese to win on Friday.
No one could build Bosnians.
"That's a good result in which, however, there's some risk, which is sorry for Bento.
“We will play against a team that has many technical virtues and players with many individual virtues”, he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are about to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, “not give them time to think”.
It's a good idea just to make it realistic this time.
