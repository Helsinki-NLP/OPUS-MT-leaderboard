The great return of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel Frenchman was summoned to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Frenchouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A 30 - year - old crawler will be on the alternator and soon he could get into the gate.
Former goalkeeper Litvinova, Plzen or Russian Čeljabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Right in the middle of the match with Vegas, he hasn't shown up on the NHL ice ever since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one bar to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be outside for approximately three to four weeks with injuries in the lower body," reported a total of Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL gate eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time was called from a farm where he picked up four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL, he wrote 94.5% of the procedures.
The breeder of the Pilsen Hockey wants to finally come forward and confirm that he is part of the best league of the world.
In the last year, he had hip problems and did not catch a single match in his short pandemic year.
In the NHL, Francek captured 36 matches, with 92.3% in progress.
Charles sets up Camille's shirt on Christmas Eve, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife, Kate, chose a family photograph this Christmas’s wishes during their trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also made his wish known, who used the photograph on which Camille helped to put the towel on the track.
On her website, she informed the British BBC News Station.
They send invitations to friends, coworkers, and foundations with whom they work.
Photographs were created somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in Khaki color and has a dress for Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same kind of prince George and Louis shorts and a shirt with a collar.
Who made the photo, William and Kate didn't mention it, it's not clear exactly when it was created.
Last year, the royal family for the photograph designed as a Christmas wish poses on a package of straw in front of a pile of wood in its rural estate in the countenance of Norfolk.
The film, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also published by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, a successor to the throne.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught them in June at the races in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and on his face, helps Camille put on her shirt in a colourful, bright-looking dress.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbra a million dollars for the title, stubborn denied it.
Prague – Crimeanists in the current corruption causation allegedly worked with the accused former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr had a promised million crowns for a league title since Prague Slavia for the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz about getting to a part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of the top club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that no corruption was allowed.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia is mainly represented by her former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended in the summer of the Master Club.
Some influential red-white officer was, according to the list, in frequent contact with both Berbrem and the former sports director of the Secondary Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia Berbra promised a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 won the team SK Slavia Prague title in the first league.
The police authority has been aware that Roman (Berbr) will win the league from officials of SK Slavia Praha promised a million payment, quoted the server from the list.
A day later, according to criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The claim of any corrupt proceeding was rejected.
Between 2015 and 2017 we actively sought to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative alternative to its development.
We have never committed ourselves to illegal conduct, we have not sought to influence the referees against the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this regard," said the Hardy for the List of Reports.
In the hearings, among other things, Nezmar is unceasingly insulting some former players Slavia dark skins and also slandering her former boss Hardyk.
The case of alleged influence of the fights through the referees triggered a police intervention in several places last mid-October, including the FACHR's Prague headquarters.
The highest built in the affair is Berbr, which no longer works in any football function.
In mid-January, as was the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are llarping cold wars.
The works will be new but essentially worse-type (the gunmen must come from a armored cabin and wear hand-guns without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, and also managed to get rid of Prague V3S and specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transportation - too small with a short flight but modern.
Drony - little and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we don't have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium-student, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I've got a hoanitba right next to town.
They were climbing the river and doing damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came here, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but, of course, a fox went out for a while.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
A poor fisherman almost shits himself, waved a man on all sides, so I called him and told him it was in a fox.
It was gone before I got off my position.
Even a man's bow to be a suckler.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a game of a lot of coincidences to make something happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermoosis that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive stuff, put your feet in a bag, and you should be fine.
Soldiers versus hamsters.
Inside, respirators got significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state responsible for purchasing and distributing gloves, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavir has issued billions of crowns for their removal in the past weeks.
The Server iOzlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day the amounts on the respirator were as different as hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved as a farm?
And why did others buy the train?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks to editor iZlas Dominicka Kubištová.
I appreciate the soldiers and armies (I am not affected by the memories of ČSLA that have been committed by older generations) but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can take classes, we don't actually have modern technology for existing professionals, and modern technology is still more complex, so the ability of the bookmarks will be rapidly lost in time.
In addition to this modern conventional conflict, where there is someone who can put it into place, it's going to happen very quickly, it's not time to practice someone again.
Finally, founders/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where they go to lead mass gerl and it is also a pronounced necessity to scare away the enemy.
Only in the Czech Republic will the fight be fought in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the gerila will be irrelevant, and we do not even have the right geography to do so.
Mainly, we don't have individual skill.
It's not even the worst.
The worst part is, half of them play like they've got it.
Then there's a situation where you're looking like a loser who hasn't hit an empty gate in two minutes, ran into an attack alone between two or even three Swiss, and you say, "TV, and what do you think is going to happen now?"
Well, of course he's being picked up as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this scaffolding "lead the defender" is so terrible that I have landed that I'm sincerely surprised to see that our attacker was able to play one of the players of the opponent.
The First Garbage
Covid’s pandemic slows down, but experts do not expect a major setback for the following weeks.
The resistance in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time and the pandemic equation has arrived, as we know, the new unknown: the variant of omicrons, which is very likely to spread faster than the current dominant Delta.
At the same time, with absolute certainty, it is not possible to say whether it can cause a more severe course, how much it helps with vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous disease treatment.
But this week also entered an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new medicine, molnupiravir antiviroticum, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease progression and associated hospitalisation by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon he should also be complemented by a Pfizer paxlovid drug, which has reported a success rate of 85 percent.
However, in addition to the hope of extending the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavir pandemic, the first deliveries to the Czech Republic have also raised the question of how the administration is prepared for the incoming drugs.
As was said to be the first to receive Merck's molnopiravir to treat domestic patients.
The company ended up on the tape as the first and because the drug began to develop long before the current pandemic broke out in order to find suitable treatment for viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
In this research it is often forgotten that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
That is why Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak grew".
See, you do research on where you ask people if they like muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most without an environment will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist shit.
And then they go and they choose sides like AfD.
She's afraid of cessal culture, saying this in public means losing her job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east test.
But they'll find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Penová and Zemmoura both have more than 20% according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three in the Czech Republic and are exactly the same.
identical because of the unit rolling so that the soldiers don't have to learn where it is, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One of them is the Brda Museum Atom and the other two are abandoned.
It is funny that the Susser did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either because of safety or the speed at which the heads were installed due to a more western position.
In these underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads, not the whole rockets, as they say.
If it was necessary to put this weapon in place, a special unit came in and picked up this head and mounted it on some kind of nasal device.
Besides the museum maple, the rest of them are in desolated condition.
On the second grade of elementary school, we had a schoolmate, Cigan, four years with him.
He was pretty cool, he was doing good jokes, he often showed up too much, but it was our mascot.
Everyone was having fun with him, often walking around and trying to explain things, he was missing, he was walking around regularly, he was playing sports with us, he didn't steal lunches, he didn't have phones, he was wearing clean clothes.
He also drove to schools in the countryside, made a variety of apes, but he was fine, maybe never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies in the same year, other classes.
Shortly after they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something, threatened and threatened other students.
I personally sell something to advert sometimes (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I've already sold to the Gypsies, money always had, tried not to pull me at a price, communication at peace.
I even sold a car like that, and a guy called in a month and said he'd already rewrote it.
I'm telling myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if anyone's white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they are in a decent society (work, work, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, he pulls his hand, he settles flats and houses, he's just a mess around him, he's making trouble, so he doesn't care what color he's wearing, but I'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start doing business, learn a language (not necessarily, at least an English language), respect our culture.
If she believes in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatika
"A young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, she succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová told the Law spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics.
Havaria probably caused the driver who took the girl.
The 18-year-old vehicle driver of the Peugeot brand probably drove from Zíchovec to the village of Bavaria and from the undetected causes to the opposite direction in the corner.
After the crash, Škoda Octavia finished the Peugeot vehicle on the roof off the road, described the accident of the South Bohemian police spokesman Štěpánka Schwarz.
A young driver of Peugot suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
It was a multiple injury and was blocked in the vehicle.
After his release, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and, in a stable condition, was transported by air to the Czech-Buddějovice hospital, according to rescue worker Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to non-EU packages, and customers often fail to provide data
Luke Neuheisl ordered from abroad several times a month.
He's mainly picking up collectors' cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars higher, where it still pays to import, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector approaches.
Since October, the procurement of small consignments has been slightly delayed, VAT and post office must be added to the customs procedure.
He's gonna get an e-mail telling him the customs are expecting a package.
It shall then be sufficient to fill in the data on the consignment and, if VAT has not already been included by the trader at the time of the sale, it shall be measured by the customs office from the total amount for the consignment and for transport.
Where the addressee does not provide for the customs procedure himself, the total amount shall also be paid to the carrier.
According to Luke Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll call one or two check boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
It's usually a question for me for five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all consignments can be delivered smoothly.
New customs rules have reduced the number of daily consignments received from abroad from 60,000 to 15 000 at the international post in Prague.
According to the Czech Post, it is also a problem that people do not respond to the calls for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments at the international post that we need to process.
If people were to fill in all the data they needed and fill in them in time, we would be about half here, according to Czech postman Matyáš Vítík.
The Solution to Inflation
See the headline, how would you suggest solutions to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to grow further.
What do you think should be done to slow this growth, or compensate?
Do we see in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this your way?
What do you think happens, what's inevitable with where it goes?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it's inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get maybe added (who's an employee)?
I was added 2% this year in gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I do when I work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why the convicted rapists are sending themselves to jail for only six months?
This head just doesn't answer to me how the court can only send such an animal for six months behind bars just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to his/her victim having a trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships in general.
And that's not to mention that a rape victim doesn't need to get over it again.
Won't this even betray the potential future report of rape victims?
A man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from the Grave reluctantly helped the guards to secure his long-awaited girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called them to her himself.
He went for it, though.
First, he approached the passerby and made up a story that he was robbed.
After calling the distress line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged “reproached ” told them that he had invented everything to make the officers come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to notify the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the guards found out that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a national search, and a warrant to arrest her was issued.
The case therefore solves the Czech Republic.
A sincere question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavonic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we have not been ethnically or culturally spoken, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with me, it's a shame the Churchill didn't fail to secure the release of the US Prague :')
Of course I don't deny that we have a Slavonic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without proof just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I wouldn't consider such a case to be true faith in myself.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god does a man have to choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that there is at least one god in one of those thousand religions that will irresistibly punish you if you believe in another god.
Even in the tithe, it is said that there is no god other than Yahweh.
So in such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to keep faith in any god than to risk choosing from those thousands of gods the wrong way and that one real god that I didn't just hit would send me to hell or to a place like this?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is so similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under the command of practitioners with practical experience.
If a person does well, he can get a professional offer.
All the ingredients of the ACR would be useful.
This could be done in cooperation with the Defence University.
We can put it this way: the cooperation between the education sector and industry, the companies are hunting in schools and there is some kind of spillage, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only when we are growing up, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one field to another, etc.
Similar spillages should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that there will never be a Russian, German or Mongol invader.
I find it funny how you view NATO as something carved into a stone, we have allies, and so they're going to defend us if there's any trouble.
Well, good luck with that.
Just one election in the U.S. that'll cut their budget and all NATO goes to hell.
The English will trade us for the Russian money, the Germans will trade us for the Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown themselves once to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works for a long time as a guarantee of independence is the armed army and the population that can control the military technology of their time.
And today, he can pilot remote-controlled resources every teenager, whatever it is that's not possible.
We don't need border reinforcements, that's far-fetched today, but a stalled teenager behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in boxed tsunamis
You're gonna unpack the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home covered with boxes and stuff?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of the shops your used boxes will welcome.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can, by agreement, bring into the connected business (KAMSNIM.cz project map contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper boxes.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated, and avoid overcrowded blue containers.
Trade alone welcomes packagings, which are currently lacking in the market and also saved money, as the packaging card has lost 50 % in the last period.
Moreover, in the eyes of ecologically thinking customers, I am strengthening my brand.
TIERRA VERDE, an eco-drug producer and eco cosmetics, is one such business.
The boxes and fill-in material in the Brno’s Popůvek are used by individuals who build up at home, but we also have companies with whom we have arranged regular shipments of decommissioned cardboard.
We'll all use it to pack packages from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together form a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and the beauty of nature for other generations, says Petra Lopusníková of Tierra.
However, www.KAMSNIM.cz shows not only the collection sites for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (to get away from your home, where to hand over medicines, tires, electric service, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end in the right place, and the reusable items will also find their second home.
The overall map of the project contains over 100,000 such sites.
“The collection courts, re-use centres, containers for textiles, food banks, charity tours, SWAPs and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise be unnecessary waste”, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Clean up the Czech Republic.
It seems to me bad that technology nowadays is so simple and stupid that children who use computers or phones play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem (mainly in English articles) has emerged that college students do not understand the principle of computer files.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple apps on photos or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with files and everything comes up on one screen in the application.
They can use technology from childhood, but let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency this weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he discovered the Presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they could not be reached in six months.
French politicians like it that way, but they like it, and even voters like it.
Macron's right-to-left proponents are small-minded, but it is in Europe.
And in France there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar also affected priorities.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such a work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately came up with the criticism that Macron was talking about European propaganda and copying history.
In fact, it's more of a translation of history to defend itself.
The French President Éric Zemmmour’s native right-wing candidate is now circling France with the idea that the Vichy regime, which has been working with Hitler during World War II, has not been so bad, and has been quite successful with this in the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea to one history textbook seriously and don't look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries have a thick learning of history as a story we versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, Frenchmen, the Czechs find out who beat in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech mouse didn't win.
The story, which comes back to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also received the award for directorship and best actress Jasnu Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vulture Festival, he was held on the first tributaries of the theatre ladder.
The best actor in Berlin became Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy and I'm not vaccinated.
It was just like "bein' the flu/bein' fucked" For a couple of days, I had a diarrhea and I didn't have a lot of taste in smoking...
It was worse than regular flu.
I don't have diarrhea at the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it.)
Christmas Book Tips
The Christmas duplicate, which will be issued on 20 December, will contain a traditional literary annex.
And with her, there'll be cultural tips.
In addition, we attach the books to you, subscribers, to this digital edition, so that you may have enough time to arrange books as Christmas gifts.

Another portion of observing the world and describing everyday things with unusual poetic attention, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, photographer Six tried to capture the essences of small towns and Czech society.
A story about a return to the roots that turns out to be just an illusion.
The Bohemian woman and the comparative woman carry the fairy tale of the Red Circle to the scenes of the present village.
Its brutal use surpasses the human versions and builds in the horror of emotional emptiness.
And the fact that the way back to your instincts is shorter than you're willing to admit.
In his last novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about the return from immigration than we used to listen.
Those who stayed, and those who left, know too little of themselves to spend on a life together.
Trains start to ride according to the new timetable, somewhere the transporters change
Since Sunday, trains have been started on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on certain routes, for example between Ústí nad Labe and Kolín, where instead of the Czech road starts to ride RegioJet.
For most lines only the departure time shall be adjusted, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Travellers started selling tickets in the fall.
The Czech tracks plan to repair on average 6783 passenger transport connections on a daily basis in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 remote trains per day.
Trains run some 118 million miles during the new timetable.
Railways along national connections under the new timetable will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new timetable, will install dozens of new trains.
The main news is that InterJet trains will be on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
More new trains will be taken by the carrier to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the fares from next year, on average by 3.2 per cent.
Prices take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry on the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The transporter here will replace the Czech Railways after success in the ministry of transport competition.
Every day, RegioJet will be on a track of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern the remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped from Sunday at Havlíčkov Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express preserved his 16 connections, two feedback connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlarík, the transporter has been trying to maintain the best time for his long-distance trains through the planned leak work.
Without major changes, Arriva trains and other carriers should continue to operate.
The carrier shall also change in certain regional lines.
The changes await passengers, for example, in the Czech Republic, where the trains of the German Trilex company Die Länderbahn will be in place of the Czech Railways.
Travelers will also be able to use a single train ticket for the second year.
As with the Czech Roads, their price will increase by an inflation of 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Do we not learn the view of the other party?
We all hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, died.
I haven't heard a lesson in my life from a slave party's point of view, or since then, no one defends this, just condemns it.
No one will even tell you in school that black people were often sold into slavery by black people themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one in school will teach you that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, and they'll just tell you how brutal we Europeans brutally murdered each other, while killing each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, right at schools, both in Northern schools and in Southern.
I didn't see anyone deliberately silence the facts, but I've heard before that it's happening and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (for example, in Japan, there's quite a taboo).
My point was that history is not black and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it's just what she is, and I think it's fatal to judge a mistake without looking at a thing from then on.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, while we're already in those Southern states, yes, confederate flags and famous slaves are quite popular there, on the other hand they have had some good success, and I thought it was absurd to dismiss them.
Besides, the North wasn't much better than the idealization of a lot of people these days.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in South was slaves, and a lot of things happened to them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, deliberately omit some of the facts, lie and manipulate, or maybe our view doesn't exist with them (the YT was also a video on TV where someone started talking about our legions and 1968).
What seemed ridiculous at the US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country never experienced.
Overall, I realized that at some universities it was shocking, those students were quite radical, and the schools supported them in that number of times.
And if I imagine these people are going to be a lot older one day, I feel a little sick that this might be the voice of most people, because among young people it is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long achieved what it has and is no longer the same, has been radicalized.
Currently, as feminists, those who have nothing in common with him and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalisation on the other side, when it often leads to resistance and in pretty reasonable things.
Besides, the more radical someone is, the more you hear them.
Anyway, at the end of the day, I also didn't see anyone judging me as colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I met the wrong map, but it was two-sided:D.
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality generally to be useless in terms of a personal identity.
If I have such interests, views of the world and common experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he's got a sermon about theology rather than politics, but then he always fucks up some cocotine about coronavir, that everybody's ashamed.
Then, of course, the Church of Czechoslovakia is Hussitian.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact, they were born of the Catholic modern and are actually catalysing without the pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to services to Hussites because it's theologically much similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square is under the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 a.m. Masses are made in Latin, as was done in front of Vatican II.
The flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts took him to Vienna this morning for the Coronavir pandemic but not this time he was taken over from his Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
He was picked up last year at the border.
The Light of Bethlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate with the unit every year, and I look forward to doing so much.
It's an honor to have been chosen, she told the present journalists the scouts Amalie Budík.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now on the Reintal crossing – Břeclav in the parking lot.
Usually for him, scouts drive by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the delivery of the flame after the Czech Republic.
With the Betlem light, the scouts traditionally traveled by train to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocese bishop Vojtích Cicrlem.
Next, on Saturday, 18 December, the Scout couriers will take care of the light delivery, who will travel with selected speeds and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take the light to stations, and then they will continue to spread the flame through the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, scouts must comply with the measures in force against the spread of coronavir.
It's happening just like last year.
We recommend both to the courier teams and to the organizers of local events, so that, of course, they carry roaches, try to keep their distances, it was at least, not to sing to colleagues, just to act as safe as possible, described the speaker's action of the Betan Hrbková light.
The tradition of the Betlem light that travels Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and peace at the same time.
The light of Bethlehem is for the believer a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes the darkness.
Scouts and scouts have been caring for its spread in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of incoherence and human reciprocity.
All updates, including the list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemske light.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basis of the economy that confirms that the subsidy is cancer of the economy, but I don't think the subsidy as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will use the money properly, and I do not understand why the money is put into agriculture, industry and overall companies.
As mentioned, it produces an unnecessary product and breaks down the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work alone in a factory where there are millions of signposts "xy financed/co-financed by xy project" in the hallways, and such a company is just artificially held in life.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the slowing down of development when this company is both holding up and taking down contracts/employees to companies that could grow after its disappearance and become more productive.
Absolutely agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person born on the Internet gets caught in some kind of trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think the internet ads are not moving with me, but then I'm still picking up that they've influenced me, too, and it's just so detracted that you don't always defend yourself.
For that reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a total ban on programmed (= targeted) advertising...
It's all crap, it's classic words - I'd ban the Internet.
I feel that this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe anything most people believe and make sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion about which I will claim to be critical of."
2. "I won't believe everything the media says."
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has failed the trend of Christmas films, two hundred of them this year's premiere
Los Angeles – Kina, TV stations and stream platforms in the United States and other English - speaking countries have failed the trend of Christmas films and will present more than two hundred of them in the premiere this year to their viewers.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has been stabilizing and increasing the audience, making these images more and more.
This year, four times as many Christmas films as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included only those images that have the word Christmas in their name, so it will actually be more holiday films.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas always existed.
In the Czech Republic, there are particularly fairy tales associated with this period, and worldwide, you also need pictures alone at home, Love Heavenly or Classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas pictures, however, was only launched in 2009, when a special film series came to the US cable television station Hallmark, recalled the BBC server.
Her adventure project called Countdown to Christmas ( Countdown to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station started its audience at Christmas already on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
The Lifetime Competition Station has 35 new Christmas films this year and popular stream platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical period of the story again it doesn't matter so much, it's important that there's a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," described this genre Brandon Gray, author of the book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be home for Christmas movies).
"For viewers it is a form of escape and a way for at least two hours to feel a little calm in the middle of all the holiday madness and madness of the world in which we have lived," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark is still using the same recipe for its films, although it is a uniform but successful one.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then it'll be about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, of course, will work out nicely, and those two will kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, Gray adds.
Mazepine had a positive text for covid-19, not going to hit the final race F1.
Only 19 riders will go to Abu Zamí’s Grand Prix in formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and he won't hit the last season.
Stand up, Haas will only send one formula on the line.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better location from the 20th line, which he left in his qualification.
However, the Rus Nikita Mazepin of Haas stable will eventually not hit the Abu Zaby Grand Prize.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
At the starting point, only 19 cars will appear, from the last line to the line Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, the first Max Verstappen, who is in direct battle with Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepine is relatively fine according to Haas's condition and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, with security being the final priority for all interested parties," said its representatives for formula1.com.
He won't send Haas to the replacement driver's race, nor can he.
The alternate would have to qualify or ride in another part of the weekend.
Covida-19 is not about the first racer.
At the start of the just ending season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year they were positively tested Sergio Pérez No. Lewis Hamilton.
They can lock you up for this too.

From the point of view of the law, it's on the list of infectious diseases.
I mean, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The prize of the most precious sweater will be impressed!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store, and he's put half a year's work into it and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, the sweaters never carried much around at home," admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours in his work in six months.
Silk was purchased in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France and 2000 ornamental crystals were added by Swarowski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds lumber,” praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend a wash.
And there's another catch.
"I am completely broke, I must sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Lebanon.
If it succeeds, it creates a world record.
Until now, the most expensive sweater sold five years ago was “Jen” 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the expulsion of up to 150 soldiers to assist Poland.
Genistes, explorers and drone pilots could be on their way before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with border protection with Belarus and with the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with the ongoing actions of the Belarusian regime, which in its territory calls on citizens of neighbouring countries with a false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already active in Polish territory.
The Omicron mutation is spreading south of Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adam's.
“We have, in fact, reported further suspicion of this variant in the next child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the U.S. Adamov has not been proven," said Cupek.
Six cases appeared in the region during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Flu and influenza viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that it was two nurses from one of the departments of Brno Faculty Hospital and two children from one of them, and two 11-year-old pupils from Adamov University.
There is no connection between Brno and Adam's cases.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, four unscrupulous.
No one suspected of Omicron traveling abroad
None of these traveled abroad, nor any of their families, nor did any of them come into contact with anyone who lived abroad.
There's no connection to the water field championship with any of the above mentioned, said Cup.

California's cutting arms sales.
He wants to act like Texas on the ban on abortions.
Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday the plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial abortion law after the detection of the embryo heart rate.
People would then be entitled to compensation in suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles in California and manufactured firearms.
Newsoma’s announcement reacted to the Friday opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in force against the almost 50-year-old Prejudice verdict, which established the right to abortion in general throughout the U.S. about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court did not now decide on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measures.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to attack him on the usual judicial path.
"I am outraged by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States yesterday, which authorized the preservation of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported the Texas Maneuver in order to protect its law," said the California Governor.
"If States can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," the News continues.
He said that he had his subordinates working in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would entitle a public representative to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
In this way they are marked by sub-manufactured weapons which do not have serial numbers and which can serve to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensations of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220 000) and legal fees from anyone who in California would produce, distribute or sell assault rifles, parts for "gallery of spirits" or kits for their production.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets, create a threat of private actions, then we should do exactly that," said the California Governor.
AP points out that California has for decades banned the production and sale of some weapons of military style, but in June the federal judge here blocked the ban as anti-constitutional.
However, if the State had now reinstated the ban by using the Texas template, the words of the liberal Member of the highest court of Sonia Sotomayor, who, in an unanimity opinion on the Friday majority verdict, would have been confirmed to warn against the extension of the legal mechanism in question to other US countries.
However, the Supreme Court did not recognise the full immunity of the Supreme Court against the judicial review and allowed the abortion clinics to continue their actions against the elected agents of the southern US State.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination schedule will look like and there is also improvement of the vaccines themselves, based on results.
For example, from Israel, a 4 dose study is already in a large wave.
And according to these studies, most patients experience a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has already had a long-term effect.
Just like any other vaccination he'll have after his vaccination schedule, it's just too soon for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should be placed on the market shortly, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer’s specifications, promises up to 10x greater effectiveness.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobor, the European Commission would act in contravention of the law if it exercised new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland because of the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for drawing EUR 36 billion from the EU fund for recovery of the economies affected by the pandemics of covida-19.
It is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and to use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries which violate the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this extortion by the EU veto in all matters requiring unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small party of Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose a close majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a dramatic rise in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will require Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU has unlawfully denied us funds from the common budget, which we are also contributing to, the Polish minister added.
His side in accessing the EU is more radical than the ruling party Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that have been made by the Polish judiciary for Ziobrov have threatened its independence and subjected it to politicians.
According to Ziobrot, Brussels builds “impossible conditions because its aim is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw faces “a political dictatorship carried out by extortion and attempts to undermine democratic decisions of several million Poles”, Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accede to such concessions by Brussels, which would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland's status as a colony," he said.
But to confess in this... we have one kind of cheese in our Lidlo in four different places.
I wasn't looking at other things, and I met one yogurt more times, and all I needed was cheese, parmesan, and after ten minutes at the milk shelves, I quit and I asked.
They had it, it's true, in this narrow sector, they were all chosen, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there's an escape, no more market, no more smell, no more action, no more gold cream in the square, maybe they don't have that choice, but they usually have everything I need, and it's got some sort of order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care.
For two years, I've been watching it deal with data like manure, and most of the opponents of vaccination are just a little bit more off the bowl than most of the vaccine advocates.

When I was a kid, they punished me with a cook.
It was never because of signs, it was usually just that I repeatedly refused to listen and to be angry (I read instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without warning, and my mother has always threatened that if I do it again, I will get a punch (sometimes even after another "once" the cook only brought and laid down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few wounds on my ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable way and in a reasonable way) is beneficial because the child responds much more to them than to words.
It's important to me that the warning part is because it gives the child a choice of whether he doesn't listen and gets or improves, and he won't be punished.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Protection of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl replied to a journalist's question in 1999, what the Czech Constitution meant to him – if a sacred instrument is sworn upon and taught in school or if an agreement can be changed if necessary, he was determined to adhere to the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
And imagine: some nations even love their rules.
Just as the Czechs liked pork and cabbage dumplings, the question of Vojtech Cepl was put to the vote.
Recently, however, there has been a growing trend among lawyers in the view that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
Years are tested by situations that her creators (which were part of Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, for example, the behaviour of the President-elect.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
All we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be considered.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to dealing with most of the crises that societies across history encounter.
The Constitution is, among other things, some kind of rule of government, consisting of individual rules which lay down the politics of the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians to bans.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also enable politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, at FN Brno they're fighting for the life of a multimonth baby.
Although it is known that coronavirus has been milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with mainly recently.
"We know that children are threatened and affected by less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said the new prime minister of the Clinics of Child Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the Faculty of Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine at the Masaryk University, Petr Dominique.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are ill with coronavir, which we see especially during the last period," said Dominic.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild support.
It happens at the clinic of infant infectious diseases.
Indeed, very seriously ill children with coronavir are only recently on the ARU.
The children with post-covidal syndrome were on the doctor's ward on a continuous basis throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, which means with pneumonia, which requires staying on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects adults, both adolescents and a few months old baby.
In hospitals there are also children in severe condition due to coronavir.
"We now have a child of several months and adolescence," the prime minister said.
However, he is pleased that at the FN Brno children’s hospital, children’s deaths have not yet been recorded on the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominic, there is an integral part of the psychological cooperation at the children’s hospital — not only in the Coronavir department.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, both in adults and in children, vaccination alleviates the disease and also reduces the incidence of post-covidal syndrome.
“We also recommend the administration of the vaccine in children,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can walk only on marked roads.
But the peaceful zones aren't that big.
They are seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
Generally, you can walk anywhere in the national parks outside the calm zone (but do not climb over the fence to the horizon).
Skiing/riding on a bicycle in a forest outside the marked road is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but, of course, it's out of the national parks so far).
How's the conductor training?
Music is in my head, and Josef Kurfirt laughs.
He's decontaminated by a liberal opera and originally played the forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing practically all repertoire and as a conductor not only works in the liberal F. Shalda Theatre, but also in Pilsen, in the Joseph Cayetán Tyl Theatre.
He works with a garden Philharmonic, a film Philharmonic, or a symphony orchestra.
China builds an impression of disease control and the fact that authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better
Sinologist Jirous: China builds up the impression of managed diseases and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better.
China has gone into medical and political offensives.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism for failing to stop a disease that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in infected people.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective aids and Chinese doctors are often helping in the fight against coronavir, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He's gonna meet a friend of his, and he's gonna say, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?"
I got him, and he's great.
The wife likes to, because she saves pot, the car washes, the kids play with it.
That's just great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
My friend, let's fuck with her, it's gonna be great.
After what time they meet and the guy who bought it complains, you dude, who sold it for an elephant?
The lawn is sore, the giant shit is all over the place, the car is scattered, the kids are afraid of him, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold it says, "You talk about elephants in a bad way, you don't sell elephants like that."
World events are controlled by giants.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the greatness that determines the course of international action.
Europe can only become such a power if it works for its integration.
It has yet to operate at economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading for federalisation.
It won't be 10 or 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and that'll work.
I figured it out, too, and it's possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm speaking.
I'm just saying that ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary on "Spanish oranges and Mandarins", when it is clear that it is both from Spain, while for "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I base it on the fact that the sentence is "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are operated on only Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in this broad concept and that it is not necessary to specify it further in the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying, "D."
Either way, it's a ridiculous request.

Vicki Holland of Britain tortured the monkey of the cosmos Milly.
Scary footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey swerved in a toilet bowl before her insensitive owner flushed her off and laughed at her.
Holland monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwenth Magistrate’s Court now forbade her from animal breeding for life, reported The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitation of monkeys who care for Milly after her abuse said they've never seen such a frightened alien before.
Milly spent nearly two years in rehab with Monkey World workers in Dorset and now is playing happily again with another saved monkey named Moon.
The fourfold mother confessed to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks in a magistrate's court in Gwent, with a suspended sentence of one year.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, has been banned for life and has to pay 12 000 crowns of judicial expenses.
Head of Small Monkeys, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue even further."
Milly took time to get used to people again.
She grunted and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden motion made her scream.
Monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, the sight of new people can still cause panic.
The psychological scars of bullying will be accompanied forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's bullying came out after the Gwenty P.D. got a scary shot at a woman's phone after an accident in her apartment for drug charges.
You can hear Milly making a vulgar speech on the footage.
The next video shows Holland's monkey offering cocaine and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) confessed to possession of cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine was found in her house for 1,600 pounds (recalculated by less than 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder's eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.

Partly it's learned for the many people who need the thing.
But like, the note that you don't really need all this stuff at the machine, I mean, really, because you just don't need it.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the point where not knowing is a sign of a punk.
(Which is likely to be the part of our communist past and our rage against the educated and the elite) However, the price of having barbarians on these machines is simply high.
Well, if the press could count, it's probably where the covid never reached these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: the war of Gadri and Andrea continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave now," Andrea answered at the Instagram in Stories on all the questions of curious fans, which disappointed her at Kadrim, so disappointed that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
From Kadrim and Andrea, it's been scraping it ever since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his imagination was that Andrea was moving behind him, at least until he returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she strongly refused.
And as you can see, not only did their relationship not end with love, but rather it grew in mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He was furious with Kadra's turnover in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged honesty of Kadri's ex-wife was no longer like his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stop her brother in public.
Normally, I don't express myself to such things at all, and even in the family, we've never said such things extra to each other.
I definitely don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone who's trying to hurt the public and screw up the name of someone I love so much, he just won't let me!
I'm sorry I have to do this on this road, but I would like to thank my brother Kadri in public for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even though he was young.
That's all I'm sorry about when I have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite out of context.
I'd love to know Kadri as much as I, our family and our family, is in a confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the truth and know how it really was, have added indefinitely.
The drunk thief climbed the facade into the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's about.
He launched his robbery expedition at Cchao in a parking lot in a residential neighborhood where he tried to get into several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually subtracted less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he didn't think of anything better than climb up the 5th floor and enter the apartment through the open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
The footage from one of the security cameras caught him walking down the street from the crime scene and eating a banana.
When the owner woke up in the morning, he found out that the bananas weren't where they were, and he called the police.
She then arrested Ccha.
A man confessed to drinking alcohol on an incriminating day.
And since he needed the money, he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and effectively linked to pandemic emergency.
If it's cancelled, the law won't work.
The law limits the scope of business
Is that not enough for you?
The right to collect will be limited, but not revoked.
More than 60 percent of the voters came to the Saturday elections to the representatives of the four municipalities
New representatives were elected on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradštěšk, Lužice in Mosteck, Nova Ves in Liberec and in Ravná in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law, or the number of elected representatives has fallen.
There were 99 candidates for the total of 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33 years.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections for us symbolically closes a relatively demanding but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections were made to the municipal councils and, above all, very closely followed elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said ČSÚ Eva Krumpová, Vice-President.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, the choices were more demanding for equipment and staff security.
In Komni v Uherskohradšek, Saturday's election was won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which gained 27.76 per cent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member representativeship.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 per cent of the vote, which also means the profit of two mandate holders.
Two seats in the representativeship were also given to the Citizens for the Komň, with 18.52 percent of the voters giving their vote.
Once again, Jana Křížková, a member of the Commonwealth, was also the mayor of the municipality.
The Communists, independent candidates, reached one mandate in the representativeship.
There were 75.48 per cent of the eligible voters.
In the village of Ravná in Pelhřimovsk, the association Pro Ravna won.
It's got 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and 1 from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
The vote was 93.62 per cent.
Repeated elections in Lužica in Mosteck again won the Union of Lužica and Lead led by the Mayor of Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 per cent of the votes and, as in 2018, has four mandates in its seven-member representative.
The second ended the municipality candidate for the people who gave the vote 43.27 per cent of the voters, so that there will be three representatives.
There were 76.7 percent of the voters in the classroom.
Elections in New Everybody in Liberec won the independent candidates Hope for New Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 per cent of the voters voted in favour of the association of independent candidates and thus gained four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
YES received 40.12 per cent of the vote and against the proper elections in 2018 strengthened, obtained more mandate and has three.
The vote was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
Then they will be published in the Laws Collection.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think all this stuff that people write to you right here, you know.
You're just playing dumb so you can have a fight with someone.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic standpoint (which eventually was the goal to look well).
And I don't care who they believe in.
On the other hand, I don't care how much church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money she had accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it's caused, for example, the 30-year-olds.
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church are not together to do
The man fell headlong down 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava who was affected by paramedics from the local health services.
The staff of the Regional Operations Centre took over an hour after Saturday midnight of a distress call with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two ZZS crews, medical and medical, headed for the site immediately.
Upon arriving at the medical post, a 7 - year - old man was to fall from a window about 20 feet [12 m] high and reach his head on the concrete!
Coal was caught in Vitkovice.
But not as it should be, and firemen went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervention physician intubated his respiratory pathways, ensured artificial pulmonary ventilation and, following other measures, carried his ambulance to another care centre of Ostrava's traumatology, informed the speaker ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have more concerns than coronavir with inadequate public and government reactions
The spread of coronavir in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against the disease, doctors and medical personnel are particularly worthy.
How serious is the situation in their view?
We're asking a military doctor, David Severus.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA has had a wonderful galaware full of interesting results.
The UFC 269 tournament is where things happen.
Outsiderka Julianna Peña was able to defeat the legendary rival Amanda Nunes, who had not found a winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in his light weight, presented against Dustin Poirier a great squeezing and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
He also defeated Sean O'Malley.
Surprise that no one expected.
This brought the women's struggle of the bantam weight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American woman entered a mutual battle as an imaginary "Trapper", Nunes did not lose seven years and broke her teeth into another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was borne in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the way for victory very actively, and the rival even gave the push kick she sent to the ground.
However, she did not let any other flaws be made and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself with a hand lever.
The second round was touching, and for fans of the MMA it was very intense.
Both rivals were honored by numerous fine blows and hard hooks.
Plus, Nunes got her to the ground where she started to strangle her.
She must have given up the effort to knock off the attack.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The top of the galavecher was the battle between Charles Oliver and Dustin Poirier with a title in light weight.
At first, however, Poirot was better off, the card gradually began to spin.
In the second, he tried to be more active Oliver, who tried to beat the rival with his hand.
Although this did not work out too well, then he created great pressure, got a rival on his back, and put a series of wounds on him.
That's why the second round won.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear somewhere that Poirier resisted for a while, but then he had to knock.
The Brazilian defended the title, on the contrary, he lost two years later.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley, the sovereign triumphant, who had already laid a hard back on Raulian Paiv in the first round.
Then he got a series of exact hits and recorded the 15th triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now losing seven years later.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, there's nothing complicated about it.
Most of the names in Czech are only one grammatical, and therefore there is no problem with determining whether they are male, female, or medium.
Then there is also a relatively large group of significant names for which the family is not settled.
Such significant names fluctuate between two generations.
When they slide, they find double ends, and in some cases they remain unfavorable.
For example, the words “swifts ” or“ hips ” are male and female, in which the first form they bow down according to the pattern “widgets, ” in the second form according to the pattern “song”.
For another group of significant names, different shapes are already in the first fall of a single number, for example: ‘shared/shared’, ‘cadluben/kedlubna’ or ‘brambor/brambora’ (food).
Both shapes are written, of the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, such as the "hocour" in Bohemia and the "corn" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, and the other Czech-Moravian pairs of words are similar to the words "kop" and "kop" and "kop" and "kowlah" and "kowlah", etc.
Some of the words that penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally distasteful, but gradually they received Czech connotations.
A typical example is the term “image”, which is both male and female, or the word “buffet, ” which remains impenetrable in the middle line of the family, but in the male, it has endings according to the pattern “garden”.
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation at the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to move further to Europe.
Thousands of people began broadcasting to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians pledge support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What exactly motivates refugees to travel uncertainly?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen the blue sky in three months and we've been suffocating, describing a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating fires Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the inhabitants themselves cope with the disaster?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison have done more to prevent the drastic effects of criticism?
And what will the countries have to prepare for in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Iko Detrich.
False charges have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone's always written all over the place.
It is uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to deny it.
I don't personally know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have experienced how often people are around them or the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
The trend was that the victims were finally opening up about their trauma.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, they will find those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "a great part of the charge is deliberate" and that it's a "trad" you only help sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic floods built houses, families have no money to complete
The prices of construction material have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have made it happen.
It does not have the means to complete built-in family homes, and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
That's why people don't have enough money to complete already built family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating an extremely uncomfortable situation.
At best, people move to uncooled homes.
At worst, the houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and still pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We'll build two or three family houses in a year, and at 50 percent it's what happened to us.
For us as a construction firm, it's hard to keep certain things contractually, even though the material has been stolen.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Sliven.
A lot of people are just gonna have financial problems.
If they were counting on building a house for five million, now it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," Sliven added.
The material was most damaged by copper, iron, and also the installation and heating equipment.
Construction companies, however, are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates from the construction industry and the influx of foreign workers hinders the pandemic.
At this point, only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favourable.
"In October, the construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček explained.
We're good, and we're gonna have a better time.
But the real vision is missing, says commentator ČRO – majAzlas
The entry into the new year, in addition to classical celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by political expressions.
This year, President Miloš Zeman and Presidents of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation in addition to the Prime Minister and President of the ANO Andre Babiša and the Christmas message.
What important thing did we learn?
Like a great diplomat comes to me right now, I've got my own theme I've chosen, I've been tying on a bachelor's room, I've always been working on it all year, and then a week or two, I write a written part.
The centurions are perfectly calm with us, if a man is not a total macaques and something remains in his head, so the commission won't be needlessly stifling on his theory.
I may have been studying at the station for a week, and when I was in the end, the committee always tried to point me to some logical detachment that I had just finished and I had it right.
Otherwise, for these projects, I know people who will pay someone to do the Semester Project (we did it many times, really useful, they'll learn a lot) and then they'll just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when at the end of the course there's a test that shows the knowledge gained in the project, not just a defense.
But don't swallow e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be as dumb as they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can still build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Pooh Bear.
You should still put it in a way that fits Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws the artists under their feet.
Once you don't do anything every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, it constantly changes what is more important as a function, whether a beacon, comment or storage.
I've been sick of it lately, so maybe I'll have to go down to the tictic, where a lot of the artists in my industry are successful and they're not going to let it happen.
In the end, I might also like to see something user-friendly coming, which does not suck out artists with all creativity and energy.
Declaration by the Party working on Donbase
The union – yes, the breakup – no, they express their opinion on the picture to the opponents of the collapse of the SSSR.
Thirty years since the illegal collapse of the SSSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind took place.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Šuskevič signed the agreement, without any legal authority and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open and respectful attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in secret, regardless of the people, that “the SSR Union as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist”.
One strand of pen has been removed by a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
By the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens were found abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten million to eleven million.
Even regardless of the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who had destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years for one session in the Belarusian Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Land War).
They have, in fact, done deindustrialisation, halted agriculture, ripped 14 republics from the world's greatest power, which had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the deterioration of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the rise of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – this is all the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender of the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is a concept in political science such as the " vacuum of strength".
Everything that was betrayed in haste and surrendered quickly filled in and conquered NATO countries, which have accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly by the events of the late 1980s and the early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond with its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will slow it down to 99 CZK / kg - describe the mechanism that will make it a burden to my digestive system by changing the meat's price?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK and left it in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These rumors that if something is cheap, then it must be guaranteed wrong, depraved or impotent are terribly retarded to tell you the truth ;-)
Now, I went to Hlavas in Brno recently, and in front of the ladies, they were handing out some pamphlets, and I always take things like this to help the brigades, they can't throw it out...
Well, the pamphlet was full of sense and conservative views of the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I knew it was going to be some kind of ogre.
After reading it, I found who was publishing it, and eventually it came out of scientology.
Well, like he was a good screw-up, full of totally useless lessons, like I'm supposed to be wrong and not be a pussy.
Too bad about the paper, that's why the rainforests wouldn't have had to do it.
I've seen something like this with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail make you make this person respond because you like him without realizing how much in p*dell the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me not to go anywhere on my knees.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It's been a great relationship for about a year, but then he ran out for another six months and started puking on her thumb.
Then I ended the relationship with her because I told her I was breaking up and I lied to her about it, but we can talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch any amok again.
Such a man of you is a source of emotion, emotion, and total joy.
You'd better keep your distance.
When the insurance companies break up here with the purchase of a cloud of tests and run for positives, who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we're getting is a complication for the companies, the transporters and others, because their employees in the random numbers generator fell five days of house arrest.
In the West, they've already stopped the joke and admitted that there's no point in dealing with the disease any less than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the war is new and has to steal something else and chase egos by making up bazaars.
I see the good old bastard is coming back again.
After several years of oppression and suppression of this unfair business, the MLM recruiting again returns to exile.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, the champion of the U.S.), the initial promise of training products and business skills quickly switched to "You don't have to care, especially getting people".
I was genuinely interested in the products that I was offering because I wanted to help people, but training was more about how to scare and talk.
When the first money made came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make money, he had to screw up a few products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profit, and then a person felt like a pot salesman.
But what I can say is, experience was valuable, a person learned that he shouldn't jump at every point and examine the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or "thick" accounts.
I've never seen a lot of things like this in a corporation.
HR is calm, managers are looking for their management, and we don't get too much nose.
Regular evaluation is going on somehow, in the form that it's going on with us quite well (set some targets for the next year, let's look at what came out and what not) - it's more self-esteem than someone would evaluate you by some number, and so on.
Corporate actions are also optional.
But we're also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more corporate.
Sometimes a person feels like we're almost-startup who's squatting in a big corporate office.
But it works so hard not to bother us as long as the results are.
The Czech missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
The British police spent nearly ten days chasing the missing 32-year-old Czech Republic, which was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced to James Kulhanek on social networks that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
This afternoon the British police confirmed to our representative office in London that she had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not be able to communicate any more information about the case.
I'm sorry, he told Kulhanek on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on a bus on the way from work on the 28th of November, and before she performed, she had to pick up money from the ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues from work five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began looking for her, and Interpol included her among the missing people around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police in this connection had arrested one man a few days ago.
What he was supposed to play in the case and what he was suspected of, but she didn't.
In four municipalities, by the end of the year, new representatives were appointed
On Saturday 11 December, in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradšk, Lužice in Mosteck, Nova Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimovsk, new representatives were elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law, or the number of elected representatives has fallen.
By 28 mandates, 99 valid candidates were held in the new elections.
Voter participation reached 62,41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Equal, where 93.62% of the eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men received the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33 years.
A total of 13 candidate documents were registered for new elections to representatives in those four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men in 28 positions.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections for us symbolically closes a relatively demanding but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to the general councils and, above all, very closely monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
Most of the time, we had to work in more demanding epidemiological conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, assessed Eva Krumpová, the first Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote shall be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Assembly of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
Dealing with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous infectious disease took me a while at the very beginning, but it didn't go too far.
Dealing with how stupidly a large part of the population is built on all of its layers, I've had a problem with that so far.
I am most looking forward to vaccination (after tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people being non-sniff.
He'd be relieved of the president's position and the ability to acquire it again.
The chance that this will really happen is how the others here mention very little.
Besides, I'm not even sure if a carded file could be considered treasonous at all.
Elsewhere is an act that the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How a pandemic affected an intimate life: A growing number of people under 35 who are without sex all year round
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
This is mainly about religiously founded people, says DailyMail.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounced sexual life rose from 8% to 21%.
A woman between 18 and 35 years of age who said they had not had sex in the last year is more than ever.
Other factors contributed to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, showed a survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impact of the coronavir pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
But it could also be the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex less and less a priority for young people.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age has increased rapidly, which states that they did not have sex in the previous year," said researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
In married people, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them said they had been without sex in the last year.
Stone added that a marriage of under 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital relations and religious institutions also contributes to the loss of sexual activity.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married younger men 35 years of age are still declining.
Young people share an opinion about premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behavior shifts this trend," Stone speaks of these thirty percent.
For the majority of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religion.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 per cent to almost 60 per cent for free people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly social alcohol consumption during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which may reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus replacing this need.
This trend was mainly affected by lockdown during the coronavir pandemic.
The whole administration of covid vaccination is whether society should make a part of the population behave that they don't want but that can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question that I'm personally most interested in about social conscience.
I.e. the question is, if we don't tell them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we would certainly not be able to catch and catch and die for the death of an eighty-year-old who didn't know very well, we didn't explain it to him.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can, for the death of a confirmed vaccine resistor, which here by the SPD and the KSC are gushing something about bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear to import that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the other group, so they will actually be able to do so themselves.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up for the drought?
This year's winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic for the last time.
Ski area operators will not escape without technical snow, and the weather also complicates the preparation of the running Jizera 50.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not about a gents.
Once in high school, the teacher took us all over town to the boathouse so we could take a ride on the boat across the river.
On the way there, we went one of those pretty wide streets, and we don't see who in the middle of the road - the followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell for us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but one of my friends and I got into a conversation.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she was told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I don't have a soul," she answered.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We're so spoiled.
It's not that much, but the system's already crashing, Orozovich says.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw on Sunday after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military respect.
"We are opening a new chapter of relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear together that it would not accept violations of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders is, according to the Chancellor, to be tackled in the west by the use of diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normand Group", bringing France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine together.
Morawiecki stated that the Chancellor informed of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially caused a migratory crisis and used people as living targets and weapons, because we record hundreds of attempts at (illegal) border crossings every night.
He and the Chancellor dealt with further sanctions so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in Kremlin finally understood that we were determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA, Scholz assured Warsaw that he enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukashenko under the regime with runners.
The drunk Polish scaffolder caused an accident, tried to conceal it.
The car returned to the scene shortly after the accident, but another nun tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license at the accident site, she went out with the truth, said TVN24.
She admitted that there was another nun who had asked her for help in the vehicle.
Then the police came to pick up Sister Celestine.
She was subjected to a respiratory test, and after they found out she was in her blood for over two minutes, she was taken with her driver's license immediately.
At the same time, they announced to her that he would confess his actions in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Shimovich didn't watch his film.
Czech family comedy creators have seen in American stories about dogs of love.
But they forgot the important thing: the legality of the film trade.
After the grotesque film F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people how to live, now the audience's emotions in the movies miss another picture here we watch.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovic ml. freely refers to his previous film Here I am guarding from 2012.
There's a talking urchin Hugo returning to the scene and some famous characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Shuuma pension that he's making up, and so they're going to call him the Peasers, Julie's father and her partner, and especially her daughter, Veronica.
She's not a little girl anymore, but a teenage girl with her first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Šajmovicová (who is also a film producer) were involved with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog's picture, but at least children and dogs enjoyed it.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario that creates a mixture of awe and a sense of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, though a scientist, is in a desire for a child’s dark delusions and, if the right “constelation” comes along, is pummeling with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined – on the hood of the car or church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), the well-trained Colonel Mozímír, despite his flight training, will shoot his own daughter in the woods (Julia), who will fall into a coma, so that the family is taken away from the hospital so that a miraculous process of healing the dogs can be played in the heart of the Shumiv loneliness.
Nothing against pure treatment of nature and the power of animal sweethearts.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer marvels at what the contents of the pelvis are full of unbelievable situations and figures were necessary for this message.
A pair of staff robbers, a pessimists' competition, a Shumuvian charlatan, cops coming to the show looking for “drugs” and discussing herbs about the fertilising strength of the bone meal – and which a burned family in a pension of course drinks.
When a heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and in turn sits on the sundulated and lined with a cigar at the family table and demands the father's whiskey and fats as a cured vegetarian, you can't laugh.
Above all, the viewers will explain that “sometimes this happens after a coma. ”
Šajmovic's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build nasal situations, the sentiments of characters and the point and leadership.
The performances are uneven, the cut is helpless and the overall impression is heated.
However Luke Vaculík, Jitka Ježková and Nela Boud are trying to stop their party, they don't have much to play.
The only place in the film is the poetic footage of the Shumav nature of the cameraman Vladimír Holomk and the pair of badgers.
It is not enough to plan a few characters, a chastity plot, and a dog’s spells, let alone the people’s vulgar expressions, of which the figures are allowed.
The argument is not even the summer membership of the Snake Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer lady.
For good intentions to promote a person's nature and friendship with a dog, there must be a knowledge of craft if one wants to tell a true story.
That did not work out in this case.
For a good family photo, there's a little too much eroticism and the minimum feeling for a genre.
Not even as a canisteria ad would've been able to get away with this amateur piece.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There's a difference between being offered and being forced, here's how you fucking understand it, but that's just because you never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to those kids all the time, maybe you'd have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case a brigade for an allowance.
The nearby east suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time in the year when it rains.
“Just as the total absence of precipitation during November, as we have observed at some stations is unusual,” the Israeli meteorological service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported November as only six percent of the long - term average.
Two days of rain this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It's also the right Christmas scene, enjoying the people of Nazareth, your Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it's bumpy and irregular.
In the winter rains, there are dependent forests.
Without them they sift and are prone to fires.
It's not just forests, it's also the drinking water supply and the soil for the farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled this spring with the last three rainy winters.
It's been dropping ever since.
Water lords warned of the drought a long time ago.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be precipitation," the spokesman for the Israeli Water Economy Office, Uri Schor, assumed in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as sedimentation or waste water recycling.
Worse are economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the capital city of Jordan, Amman, there are tankers.
Water and private wells are drying up.
"The year I received orders of seventy to eighty percent compared to two previous years," Imad Sulejman said in September.
In Isfahan, the farmers and security forces clashed.
The reason for the protests was dry.
There was no water in the river.
The region has been having the driest November in many recent years.
Israel Prepares Military Action Against Iran
The Israeli Defence Minister stated that the Vienna negotiations had not brought any progress and had informed Washington of preparations for the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military strike against Iran, informs Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to convince Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and the world powers“ to see the Iranians play with them”.
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I've been babysitting my wife a little and grilling during the interview to find out what she really wants me to do.
I finally found out that my suspicion of pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these sneakers, so I gave Miss some more time of questioning and questioning and finally thanking and leaving.
You can tell me I've been a pain in the ass, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, waiting for them enough snow and nice weather
The mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major demand for skiing this weekend.
After the intensive snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some skiareals have therefore started operation.
The rider has not denied even the obligation to prove himself in the case of lifts by means of a credit certificate.
While hauliers do not complain about the lack of customers, some ski rentals report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the region of Liberec went to the ski slopes and to the slopes for the weekend.
The skiers wanted the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, this starting weekend has really come from Friday night skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill," said the sports director Ještěd Jakub Hanusz.
Hundreds of people went on their first weekend skiing in the new season to the autumn season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the Branná resort in Šumpersk opened.
Weekend visits were very decent, and on Saturday even today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are super.
The sun was shining today, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, he did not save the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Squiareal operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or who are within a period of time after the covid-19 disease has been studied.
Except for the exceptions, people are prepared to prove themselves necessary documents, said ČTK René Hronesh of Špindler's Mlýn Ski Centre.
"We've only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic reports some rentals and ski facilities stores.
It's an interest to borrow skis.
It's not like last years, but there's still enough customers, Alexandra Bokišová from the opava shop Skiopava.
Greater pressure is expected during skiing courses.
Also, Snowbear David Shinták, the head of the Royal Garden Society, feels that it is not about lending ski equipment such interest as it used to be.
This time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Unlike the period before the pandemic, we were about 50 percent, said ČTK Shinták.
According to him, people were lazy with pandemics and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by a rental facility in Novako’s area on God’s gift.
With skiing, they started there a week ago, and interested people must now order them in advance.
"We are beginning to lend the refugees this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect great interest, as well as last year," said the operator of the Pavlín Nováková area.
The interest is comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, about the ski school as well.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a good life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people who don't have any property are going abroad.
The owner of the company abroad isn't going anywhere.
The rest, but you totally agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
Immigration from Hungary began by winning Orbán one beautiful day, year ruled, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is an election at all.
If it's a bad place to live here, some traditional V4 lunatic can win.
Young and educated will leave, remain his supporters, and people whose property cannot be pushed into the plane.
Scary photo!
A Langmeyer in the blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic was in full autumn, in Thailand, the staff of the film Island led by Jiří Langmier (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor, however, published a blood-bleeded face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a treatment for shooting?
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech.
The last time she was seen was on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior at all and we are beginning to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department said in a Saturday video, where Srncová worked.
“Her family in the Czech Republic has great concerns about her, and she just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech Republic according to it on Sunday 28 November around 19:45 left work and headed home to Camberwell.
The last time she was reportedly seen on a bus was about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by someone from her coworkers on December 3rd.
Srncová, according to the British media, acted as a “health nurse” at Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas Hospital Hospital.
"We have great concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," said a group of medical facilities in her Twitter account.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help find it to contact the police," the communication continued.
The public also calls on Mrs Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the Srncová case during the press conference on Saturday.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried about her death," said a Labour Policywoman, holding a photograph of a woman distributed to the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly heavy responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family and worked here for our health," Harman said.
The police have previously detained one man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC intelligence website, no information was provided by the police regarding his identity or what he was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
This is not how I underestimate Ukraine.
It's not "great quantity," but it's about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of Invasion is being magnified and is beginning to have our entry full of teeth.
I felt it up there.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted war on.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has GDP in Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is out of the question, I don't even know where to begin.
I can compare that with the first punch war and the "anxie" sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it is not going to comply with the agreement from Minsk, Russia is invoking the ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would say.
It's a pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables have been in place since Sunday in Prague, affecting mainly suburban connections
Passengers in integrated transport in Prague (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, especially concerning suburban connections.
There were new links, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
Mladoleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital, the Czech Budějovice speeds have been stopped since Sunday at the Garden City Station.
Trains S7 will take the suburban train to the Czech Brod on the route from Beroun to the Prague Main Station.
In a recently operational station Prague-Zradní City will again stop speed R17 from České Budějovice and Benešova.
The PID will be expanding to other areas.
Among other things, buses will travel to Light above Sázavo, Blatna u Jesenice, Old Splinter and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladoleslavsk including lines with crossing to Liberec and Královéhradecký region.
The integration will cancel 77 lines, 37 new ones will be introduced and traffic will be adjusted to 12 functioning ones.
From Prague Zličín will get a new bus line 405, which will go to Žatce.
There was also a new direct connection between Praha – Kralovice near Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be strengthened in the morning tip and the weekend of the connection from Prague to Rakovník, when the express link number 404 comes out.
Links 400 and 410 are now included in the PID system, which travels to the Liberec Region.
They leave the Stažkov Metro Station, not the Holešovice Station.
The four-point line 400 goes through Mýlník, Dubou and Český Lípa to New Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburek or Cvikov.
Supplementary line 410 goes through the Milnik and Dubou to Doks, Mimno and Jabloný in Podještěd.
On the contrary, the new operation on ten medieval local lines is cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál under Třemšín.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, the long-term restrictions on railways Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín are continuing.
Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or stretch the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a follow-up from Prague, where you can use PID tickets to Milevska.
The change took place on the routes 540 to 543 in Nymbursk and the routes of some buses at the border of central Bohemia and Hořovicka in Pilsen region are adjusted.
Healthy snacks/dining at the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only option to get food is to go next to Billy or a little bit further to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and in a hurry I'll buy a maximum pizza bean and a yogurt and an apple snack.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend to me at the supermarket buy?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately it is.
And it's not about trees that you have to see.
Under the snow, only a handful of trees can be hidden.
If damage occurs, the tree may be more susceptible to mushroom disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're forbidding us to go off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Gift of a relationship with Nedves: This was not what I was looking forward to.
Since Friday, the Czech showbusiness pond has been living on nothing but the discovery of the relationship of Dara Rollins and Paul Nedves.
They've been pulling it together for years, and a famous football player even got divorced for a singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why love had been hidden for a long six months.
"I allow myself to say that there is currently no one in Bohemia or Slovakia who would have escaped that Dara caught a bear, so sorry, Nedveda," jokes Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we weren't both looking forward to, but we knew that once it would happen, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse at it.
If those who don't care at all and jump out of a can, or us whose lives are thoroughly surveyed.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend were good enough, or whether you insisted that, however, all of you really know in detail your ex-partners' list and were familiar with the calculation of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a hula, that's what you want, Dary.
The double went together in Italy, where Rollins drove to to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedves back there have long been acting as Vice President of Juventus Football Club.
They went out with the truth right now because they were waiting for Nedvez's divorce.
They've been separated for three years with Ivana's wife, but they've only been married for three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
And we're just people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have a heart in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and like him with me, I stand with him, and in good and bad, she locked up the Rollins.
Hey, the other commentators probably already said all the important things, I'm just confirming that colleges are great in the beginning, my classmates usually met during the first semester or two, and they made friends, and then they found a lift together, which I think is the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments don't usually look too long ahead, so I don't think you'll find much of it right now, but looking at the offer won't hurt.
Otherwise, it certainly avoids not only Cejla but also the surroundings (the streets such as Vranovská, French etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of the Jews are a little ghetto.
On the other hand, Vevere's a lot of student, the King's Field and that way it's fine, besides it's close to most VUT faculties (I don't know where you're coming from).
I've never been able to find a rent, but I'm a native Brno, so I can consult Brno as one if you lack any more information:)
But that's an example of "normal" thinking.
What several doctors in Poland have decided to do in Poland is actually perfectly fine that the state does not fund some schools.
Whether they teach themselves what they want and pay for it from their own or whether they go according to the state and pay the state.
After all, we can't let a private actor control a piece of school just because a few crowns come into his state's full contribution and that's why he'll be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim loses some weight when it is written by a person who, two days earlier, expressed himself this way about a petition for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So the vote against going to abortion is the same for you as the vote against any statue standing in the square?
Being you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in cataloguing/digitalisation that (even for years professionals) it either throws away from the eye or writes something like xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and notes that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note based on what kind of program you're using.
If you want to be a good and hard-working student, you can look into some character databases and look up the nearest one.
But because it looks like you're drawing on a book, I'd imagine that the author or the printer simply created his own character that fits what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it more of an Odryska Empire (kingdom) than OdryNska?
PS: someone's already broken up with you.
Take a look at the comment with
The politicians have no idea what our Presidency will be like.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is a smile.
All the important approved documents are examined by word, and any basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for non-formal contacts, the imposition of over-standard relations.
In addition, with this English, it is quite interesting, after GB's performance from the EU.
I don't understand the Ceil hat.
I've been working there for the third year, and I'm totally fine.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 p.m. and never a problem.
Just because it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's almost never walked in there in his life.
Yeah, I think most Roma people in Brno live there, but the only thing they do is they stop on the sidewalk and park where they don't have:D definitely isn't that I'm afraid of going out on the street there tonight.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would probably go into it.
The full house is now renovated or newly built.
Felix Sloveček (78) without Dáda and mistress Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people at the adventurous age lit the first candle, not Felix Slovaček.
I don't have an adventurous wreath, so there's nothing to burn.
I've seen the days of the wreath, and I'm sure Lucie has one too, said to the Saxophonist Bright, who so confirmed the words of Patras, that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
The little word still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We met with Anika, Felix and both grandchildren recently.
VIDEO: Felix Sloveček and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SOLU!
Felix Sloveček and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SOLU!
But we kept talking, so it didn't happen at Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I'm buying presents all the time, and I'm sure I'm gonna buy something from Dad and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to baptize a music video clip at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I'll always find someone I like to play with, says Slovaček, who was happy to meet the wife of Human Sobota Adrianu or Kamilu Nývltová singer.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a total idiot not to plant this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, so can you explain it to me?
I don't know any other file that could be put in the hospital crisis.
There are few policemen, and they can't afford it, and so are firefighters and nowhere else so high a percentage of health-trained people are not at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava just goes to the heads of the previous governments, not the army, they've been asking for new toys long enough.
Record dryness in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic has been going through the worst dry season in recent years.
According to scientists, the waters have been abandoned in mountain and mountain areas, and a smaller amount of precipitation has also been recorded in places where the need for moisture has not yet been recorded.
The reason for the drought that prevails in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But it also strengthens the way we farm land.
What should we prepare for in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's gonna be like that, I can barely stay in the ice skates, I know what hockey is, and the tactics (which I've tried at the Franchise Hockey Manager) are also a whole hall.
And whether you're a hockey team called "The Bear of Russia" or "The Lama of China" that loses by two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, it's different than when compared.
However, as I listen to the Czech commentators who exclaim what the referees ignore no matter whether male or female hockey, this is all weird, but this is probably about all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
The controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the other way around, it's like it's always been, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have already lost more often than it won, it would probably be the classic "vones" all "we won".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, 9080 daily infections were reported by the Czech Republic.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Cases confirmed in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,996.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain faces a "inexerable" major wave of disease caused by Omicron, said Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical consultant for the British Health Authority on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
So far, no one has died on the omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after the disease and death about three weeks after the disease.
Chief of British Labour, Kair Starmer, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by organizing a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when the lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of the Johnson government pleaded that the quiz had taken place “virtually, ” via a computer.
However, he was involved in Downing Street by a group of employees gathered around computers.
There's a pressure in Britain to remove Johnson from the Prime Minister's office.
During last December, when a tight lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers organized numerous parties despite lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Today two years ago Boris Johnson won by a crushing majority in general elections.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
It's remarkable how quickly the events developed.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in spring that can end the 12-year-old government of Viktor Orban.
It will be the choices of pan-European importance.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They won't even be free, 'cause they weren't even the last two elections under Orbán.
His side of the Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
So far, the last one sounds like everyone can actually vote wherever they want.
This will allow the Fides to tie the voters from the determined constituencies to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it'll be as unfair as 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
It used to be, not if Fidesh would win, but how much and if he would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will gain a unified opposition.
It's for Viktor Orbán and his side is a big mess.
Won't they be able to keep playing harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing so far.
Recently, a recording by the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fisez László Kövér was leaked to independent media, explaining that opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It's all starting with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, I don't either, her dad has a long time, but then she blows extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very bloody, and I got angry as a little awful, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a cramp and all blue, and it took me about 2 times in the shower to calm down.
Sometimes I had a dance, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I certainly have a tendency now to deal with things by violence, like a little girl I've been doing quite a wash, now to beat at least into something, and as a younger person, I need my parents so much that I can't get over my arm, so I never get anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosive, but I'm sure the training has its share.
I'm afraid I'm also going to lose patience with my children and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially at a time when it wasn't "healing," but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just fucks something up, it's probably not possible not to let their kids down a little bit, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me at all, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
So I'd call Kundami what laws make up in that quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not worried about a loss of income?
Is it really possible to count on people to want and buy a product and you have a mortgage to pay for?
The cat's obnoxious world.
Where will Slovakia proceed with the Kuciak journalist's murderers?
In Slovakia, the main treatment begins in the trial with a square accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martiny Kušnírová.
The death of an investment reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She was moving the civil society, but she also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marian Kočer and his connections to the tops of Slovak politics and justice.
How major a break will the process mean for Slovakia?
This is what journalists can do for.
How is it possible that this petition had a good deal of media attention than the opposite of dean's of all medical faculties, which went out about a day, two later?
No way, they got messed up and the company jumped out.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage sites nowhere
Proposal by Minister Karl Havelíček to recast
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiše is at the end of a law that should ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens when selecting and allowing deep storage of high radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion on a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government after the summer talks.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the municipalities involved in the Platform against deep storage, but also with the Land of Cities and municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments are expected to increase significantly their ability to decide on the storage facility, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and required by the Czech atomic law as well as by the European directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to recast the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposal of the law by Minister Karl Havlíček, who has the Platform at his disposal, is particularly opposed by the municipalities: The proposed degree of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on location for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
It can be effective only if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at any given location.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the management of storage facilities to require the consent of the municipalities concerned prior to the start of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a substantive intention almost completely disregards the public involvement and makes citizens of municipalities practically only statisticians in authorisation procedures.
The proposal lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the entire search and location selection process for storage, authorisation and operation.
The representatives of the municipality, according to today's legal standards, do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when searching for a storage site.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they comment or withdraw, but it is up to the Office or the Minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation.
Such action shall not have a suspensive effect on the conduct of research or construction work.
The cooperative decision-making of the governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those where they have already made progress in the authorisation of storage sites, such as Sweden or Finland.
The drafting of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SURAO following contracts with lawyer Jane Zemánek.
According to the register, the total amount for these works is to be almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknikčka, the village's deputy mayor of Ceyle from the town of Hrádek and speakers Platforms against a deep repository said: After ministers of industry, who compared the position of governments towards the public authorities when searching for a deep storage site of high radioactive waste, we are looking for a stronger turn from the new government.
We're offering you a helping hand.
We also thank the Alliance of Cities and Communities for their support, which sees the problem of the insufficient rights of municipalities for such essential construction in the same way as the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be confined to deep storage only.
The Platform further calls for the decision to choose the location for any storage to be made subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Herce John Goodman (69) made him lose his fear: He threw 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually intimidated by doctors.
They told him if he didn't die, he'd die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the sitcom fat Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused him to crack the furniture.
"I pushed everything into my mouth," the actor said in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I get to the age when I can't afford to sit there anymore, he told ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss and what "boss" you want to use.
If it's some text on a platform that's expecting a game-based reader, I wouldn't translate it.
If it was a formal text, perhaps a college text, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain the bosse.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Like the game of Dark Souls etc. has the bosses several that yes, and so the boss is something like the master / ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to beat the game or level has been completed, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then you need games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player is not directly familiar with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and you can call them that at all?
Well, then they're mini bosses.
It simply does not translate the boss simply, the Czech language and not the other languages (just the Catalan language, which the bosse translates as the final opposer, is interesting).
It is short for a story or game generally significant, a computer controlled, an opponent stronger than all the previous and watching the completion of some level or task.
After the missing Peter from London, he's searching the world.
The Czech police also joined.
After the missing Petra Srncová has been looking for British police since December 3rd.
Czech police also joined the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradštěrska has been looking for since December 7.
Through Interpol, he's also helping the British police.
The Czech Republic, Petr Srnc, was last seen by its colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow pendulum for it.
The whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police work closely with the British police," police spokesman Katerina Rendlová confirmed.
"We share information on the case together," she added.
A public search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it's six feet tall, thin, brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London’s hospitals.
Friends and colleagues worry about her, such disappearance is very unusual for her
A woman named Harriet Harman joined in the search for Petra.
She's involved in hanging flyers with Petra's face.
"We have great concerns about her," she said at a Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have arrested one suspect.
But it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Peter.
Prewar Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decline in the assault campaign, last month with the coming year’s attacks significantly increased.
We recorded a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on 18 November.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
The infected Annex in an e-mail should draw the attention of the user to the name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous annex in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the account repair for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Estet.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
Harmful code actively searches for stored registration data, which then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the coming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, in this case, the attackers did not specifically target the Czech Republic and security specialists in November to capture more campaigns with global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but it continues to be worth almost five of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on days 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contained the most frequent .exe attachment bearing the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The name of the account, however, continues to appear.
The annex in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline in activity has been recorded by security analysts in the Fareit program, which has stood for 1.6 percent of the attacks and in the Czech Republic has had no more offensive campaign in recent months.
That demo of the smarts who don't need oxygen today, because oxygen is for a vaccineed jerk.
Praho's guide was bigger than the media said.
I don't think there's an estimate of about 10,000 people based on the footage of the coastline parade and my experience.
The people in the parade filled the shoreline and the bridge and the opposite coastal communication.
That means a lot of people.
About four thousand demonstrators are spontaneously added to the parade.
I'm saying something new is born here, says Radek Wetý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or classes of the population led to the finding of a common word.
Only the anti-vaxers themselves, the anti-missiles and the community would not be able to fill or pay such a large parade.
The action of Chcipl's group has a growing popularity, and it reminds me of a million moments for democracy in reverse.
Sometimes I feel like they're renting the same stage and technique.
It's hard to tell what move this dissatisfaction would make, it depends not only on the amount of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a four and more dosed vaccine.
It's definitely not a left or middle movement, bet you.
The three-day vaccine will almost certainly become multidose, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The genius of scientists, for whom humanity is rightfully proud.
At the end of the path, Bulgaria has a new prime minister reporting change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev commissioned the formation of the new government, Kiril Petkov, from the anti-corruption movement We continue in the change that won the November elections.
This has already succeeded in forming a government of a wide coalition that should take over the office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost its election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties were unable to agree on the fight against bribery and abuse of power, so that there were still two early elections.
What do cats do when no one's watching?
A global hit is made of 'secret' captured images.
In Britain, concerns grew over the fate of the 32 - year - old Czech Republic, which the London police have been looking for for for a few days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she went home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
According to information about the staff member of the child hospital, the police and her current employer or representative of London, where she lived, are called.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior at all and we are beginning to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department said in a Saturday video, where Srncová worked.
“Her family in the Czech Republic has great concerns about her, and she just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech Republic according to it on Sunday 28 November around 19:45 left work and headed home to Camberwell.
The last time she was reportedly seen on a bus was about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by someone from her coworkers on December 3rd.
Srncová, according to the British media, acted as a “health nurse” at Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas Hospital Hospital.
"We have great concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," said a group of medical facilities in her Twitter account.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help find it to contact the police," the communication continued.

In the Ústí nad Labem, a moon hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the RSD, which the road belonged to, and because it did not react, the hole of the green.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD began "the situation to be addressed intensively".
