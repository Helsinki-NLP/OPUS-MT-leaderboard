Members of the Wells National Assembly are concerned that "they look like maps"
Some of the members of the congregation are surprised by the suggestion that their name be changed in the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament assembly.
Members of the congregation of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may be an object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his party was concerned that "he rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh: the Welsh twp means "foolish/crazy", and pwp means "what".
Plaid member said the party was "not happy" in its entirety and offered alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party's deeds were "free-minded" for changing the name, but noted that the similarity of the words of the MWP and "mapet" (Muppet) was great.
In this context, the great letter "w" speaks in a similar way to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law to introduce changes in the name, said: "The final decision of any words to name members of the congregation, of course, will bring the members themselves."
Wells' government law of 2017 gave the Wells congregation the power to change its name.
In June, the commission announced the results of public consultations on proposals indicating strong support for the appointment of the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
For the issue of the name of the members of the assembly, the commission prefers the members of the Welsh parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from the public consultation.
Members of parliament propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can cause headaches for Assembly President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give their final voice on the issue of their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name in "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
A popular vote was put forward in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a right to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite to change the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell shone while churches in Harlem face problems
"The historical, old people I talked to say that there was a bar and church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither is there."
He said the disappearing of bars is understandable.
"People are socialised differently today," he said.
"Bars are no longer living rooms in neighbourhoods where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of properties will not last as long as leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place from which they started."
The churches, he added, can be replaced with residential buildings filled with people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"Most of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are whites," he said, "and that's why it will accelerate the day when these churches are closed down completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by congregations of whites before Harlem became the metropolis of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The congregation of black people practicing their faith near the building takes over.
St. Martin was taken over by a black assembly during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th street vendors, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since Father Johnson's parish members had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the Carillon "the bell of the poor".
An expert who played the carillon in July called it a different "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first Carillon in the world to play a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger Carillon to Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin over the past few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, a part brought by the impractical leaders of the church and a part of the Episcopal Empire.
The church council – the church's governing body, composed of unscrupulous leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will demand to transfer the costs" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parish members complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark hurt a 13-year-old in a lobster dive in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day of the lobster season, the authorized organs said.
The attack happened about seven o'clock ago near Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB television in San Diego that he dived with his friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing to the group to help them get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that he initially thought it was an excitement to catch lobster, but then “he realized that he was shouting, ‘ I was bitten!
He bit me! ”
The whole key bone was looking at him," Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I called on everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the children's Radi hospital in San Diego. He's been misled as if he were in critical condition.
We don't know what kind the shark was responsible for the attack.
Beach savior, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but decided that the shark was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed the beach on the side of Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Supercool and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of goods houses filled with professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom, which weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and household declines, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores everywhere in the country and will be presented in several stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty emerged after supermarkets began to look for ways to use the space of the shelves once designed for TVs, microwave ovens, and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's said they would for the first time double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal brands, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas like those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunchs its series of Boutique makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly required by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Creedon, southern London last week, and the second opened in Seli Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, the director of Sainsbury's, said stores would look more and more like shopping houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight the discounts Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's started putting stores at Argos in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they believe increased the sale of groceries and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt at a supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after disagreement over the way in which the profits from the chemicals stores were divided into supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It was said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be able to offer advice.
Our brand series is designed to respond to every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a mandatory destination for the beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "Wrathful" after Holly Willowby withdrew from a £11 million deal
Peter Jones star from Dragons Den left "raised" after TV warden Holly Willoube withdrew from a 11 million-pound deal with his branded life-style business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
The couple's business is connected to Gwynette Paltrow's Goop brand.
This 37-year-old leader of the morning program told Instagram he was leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, Dragons Den's star, retreating from their profitable branded life-style business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "raised" when a TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlov, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to £1.5 million -- mean that she no longer has time to devote herself to their brand Truly for household products and accessories.
Business is connected to the Goop brand of Gwynette Paltrow and was said to double Willowby's wealth at 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain in one of his weekends.
One source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
That would be her long - term future in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all those concerned caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was going on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe's seat full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of this morning's leader, one of Britain's most paid stars, can cost the firm millions because of large investments in pillows and candlesticks, clothing and household products and the potential for further delay.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with Kap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
Two guys go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV company.
Willowby should become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant Mcpartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebryty on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday "We do not comment on his business exploits".
A serious conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media about commenting that some would consider "non-presidential" and because he is so positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his voice disguised as "a news rep."
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Young Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly that the North sees no "appropriate response" from the United States for North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his speech at the rally.
"We agree perfectly with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people were going to die.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results -- completed rocket samples, helped free the hostages, and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It is easy to be presidental, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we will have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island and claimed hundreds of lives
The consequences of the Lombok earthquake, for example, told foreign NGOs that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population has been displaced, a basic accident has not been declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although “Save the Children ” is a team that will travel to Palu, it is still not certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Because of the ongoing earthquakes that plague Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of siren to warn of the tsunami in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for treatment of earthquake victims headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign focused on improving Indonesia's old infrastructure and spending a lot of money on roads and tracks.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the light of the elections next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows, arrows, and other old weapons.
See: Daniel Staridge of Liverpool team equals against Chelsea
Daniel Staridge saved Liverpool from a loss at the Prime Minister's goal at 89th on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Staridge on about 30 yards off Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before heading for the distant article.
The ball was moving high above the hexadecimal as it turned to the right corner of the grid.
The ball finally passed through the jumped Keppa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to come into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shak always give as much as possible, so I just tried to create myself as much time as possible," Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante approaching and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I was just kidding."
Chelsea led 1 to 0 at a half-time after Belgian star One Hazard scored a goal in 25 minutes.
The attacker of the "floats" turned five times back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before hitting the ball almost half the ground, and then sprinted into half of Liverpool.
They quickly served with Kovačić in the middle of the field.
He then launched a missile, leading Hazard to the 16th.
Hazard went through the defense and finished in the network of a distant figure with a left-foot strike near Alison Becker on Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the championship league's group phase at 3 p.m. Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will meet Videoton in UEFA League Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami casualties in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell in the 7.5 earthquake that struck Friday and caused 20-foot waves, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was piled up with a shot of broken buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated since a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Mercisade.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds on Grayson Mows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something on our car cameras to contact us because they can have information that matters to our investigation."
Police spokesman that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found at the facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and, according to the police, they will inform the victim's loved ones.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mows just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that there was no way in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The tenants have now been told that they will spend hours before they can return.
Someone heard a police officer tell a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman dressed in tears appeared on the scene.
She keeps saying "it's so terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were in the border, and another one was outside.
A number of police officers were standing in the cordon watching the apartments.
Anyone who has information asks to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters on 0800 555 111, quoting 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament has become the latest memorial strike in a fight for "translation of history"
Its persecution would be a poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "need to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure in front of Westminster’s Palace would become a target.
The icon class of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed to the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell’s beautiful presentation of Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is evidence of 19th - century thinking and a part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many believe, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of the parliament of external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely accurate performance is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
A killing pig broke up and killed a Chinese farmer.
A pig attacked and killed a market farmer in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name "Juan", was found dead with the femur artery, bled in near-coin blood at the market in Liupanshui in Gitzou province, South China, Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to administer vaccines to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xinning in Kinghai province, China.
He apparently traveled with a cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The following morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door to the next pig’s feces.
He declared that there was a great heathen in the carriage with the blood of the mush.
The forensic examination confirmed that the vet had broken up the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's foot was bloody and broken," said a cousin named "Wu," as quoted in Guajang's evening news.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
Market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police gather evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs that attacked humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring torrential rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as she moves across the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain floods in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought in 85 mph winds, a hurricane of category 1 from 5.00 east time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the United States, as Rose nears the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to enter a large tropical humidity north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture that is approaching will produce heavy rains in the southeast for the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, torrential ruins, and possible landslides in the desert.
The great tropical moisture will cause rain that will be in some places about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Sudden floods can be caused by rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is especially recommended that you do not walk in the desert on foot, with the possibility of tropical rain.
The torrential rain can cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and stormstorms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The coming depression will bring local rains to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of a total of more than half an inch can be produced by rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
The occasional tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rain spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
The torrential rain will spread to the "four angles" on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense changes in temperature are expected everywhere in the United States due to Arctic cooling, but tropical areas remain at high temperatures.
At times, this results in dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperature will be found in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to recreate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures of 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our forecast for a longer period points to the possibility of surrogate temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony on Thursday of the nominated Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano and the woman who accused him of sexual assault reportedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the undisputed political situation continued, with speakers who broke down regular programs for Friday's turnout: Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, drafted an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that it was 100 percent certain that Cavanaugh took down the piano and tried to take off her high school party clothes.
Cavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure that it had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen reported, saw it on Friday.
The company counted average viewing of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they displayed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who see in offices.
To show it better, it's an audience of a size similar to a playoff contest in football or the film academy awards.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavano’s appointment, led to all 5,69 million average viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After moderately the Republican office announced that he would vote for Kavano, CNN and CBS cameras caught him as protesters calling him Friday morning as he tried to get into the elevator for hearing the judicial committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as they reprimanded him, and all of this was transferred live to CNN.
"They are here in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?"
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that there would be more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee was supposed to vote to advance Kavano's nomination in the voting Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was a deal with the FBI that they would consider the charges against the nominee next week, which was demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced of his conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and then with several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had great meaning, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "playing politics" on coastline
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the Birmingham Conservative Party conference, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right next to her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Briggs, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the borrowing costs is "fully absurd".
Shooting at Wade Simms: Police Arrest Suspect Diton Simson for Death of an athlete at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Simms' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Diton Simpson has been arrested and detained under second-degree murder charge, Baton Rouge's police department said.
Authorities released a video from the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, said WAFB's partner to CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
East Baton Rouge's pathologist's office published the preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The Department thanks the state police fugitive unit of Louisiana, the state police forensic laboratory, the South University police and the citizens of the area for the assistance they gave in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for her "activity in the search for justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot beck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 caught balls after the game in the last season.
On Friday morning, coach of the basketball team at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "destructive" and "in shock" since Simms' death.
"This is what you care about all the time," the coach said.
Vulcan spewed ashes on Mexico City
The dumping of ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern settlements of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans Sunday not to go to the volcano after taking action in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre followed more tattoos and shakes.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in urban areas in Mexico City, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity of 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 shook Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters of independence clashed with police for public order and peace and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote.
A group of disguised separatists detained by police for public order and peace threw eggs and dust color, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights also broke out, and police used their batons to wipe out the fights.
For more than a few hours, independence groups shouted "No forget-no forgiveness," and trade union protesters shouted "Long to Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterised the October 1st referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalonians.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the turnout was low due to boycott by the people who opposed secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting in the region's polls.
Independence groups campaigned overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations of support for the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician, Narcisse Termes, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia had the chance to gain independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
While winning a vital but close victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties for independence struggled to keep the momentum of the year with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-elected persecution or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and a consistent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic, Hoan Puig, recording a protest to support the police, said the conflict was backed by politicians on both sides.
"It is becoming increasingly stressful," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hungeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before a trial last year, announced it would run in elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonders: Men Arrested After Putting a Car Into a House · Global Voices
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after repeatedly driving a car to a house in Londonbury.
The incident took place in Balinaard Cresent on Thursday at around 7.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage to the gate and to the building itself was caused.
At one point, it could be shot with an arrow from a crossbow to a car.
Menga's hit brought Livingston victory from 1 to 0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone secured victory
Advanced Livingstone stepped up the Rangers by signing Stephen Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as Club Ibrox's manager.
Dolly Menga's score turned out to be significant while Gary Hold's side rose to one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's side remains undisturbed in the season's championship and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which they are eight points behind.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in Europe the League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues unbeatable in the division during six competitions, and Coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingstone misses the chance against cruel guests
Holt's team had to run long before they scored the goal, and their directness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was pulling the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts from a distance after skating played the blow with Craig Halket's head over the goal.
Guests were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create problems with the stakes set.
And that's how the judge's goal came in.
Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingstone got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga together, who only touched a goal from the centre of the 16th.
Until then, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but couldn't break through the defense of the hosts, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't play for the most part.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos is taking action to rescue Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of the Rangers' goalie, Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball far away from Livingstone's yet another action.
Livingstone's 16-year-old was constantly passing through and was constantly defended, while two requests for a penalty -- after the challenge by Halket for Glen Middleton's replacement and one for hand-playing -- were rejected.
"Phenomenal" by Livingstone - analysis
Alastair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the arena Tony Makaroni
Phenomenal game and result for Livingstone
They were excellent, continuing to overcome the expectations of this upper path.
Their style and character of playing have barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga was still holding Connor Goldson and Joe Waral on standby.
Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as Gerard was once led, they are now lagging behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once managed to open the hosts – and it was a small awareness of the Rangers, which were found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed up in Colony
There were smiles and blue skies Sunday (29 September) when Turkey and Germany leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have worsened because of problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds have also made statements, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposition protestors reflect the visitor's division as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat from others.
Road crash in Deptford: a cyclist dies in a car crash
A biker died in a car crash in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of the streets of Beswood and Evelyn, a traffic accident with a major riot in Deptford, in the southeast of the city in about 10.15 BST.
The car driver stopped and relief came, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred months after the death of another cyclist in a traffic accident on Childers Street where the driver fled, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officials are working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks are set up and buses are redirected and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six police officers injured in riots
Six prison cops were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
The riots erupted at the HMP Long Martin in Vorchestshire at about 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
The Tornado unit's specialists have been brought in to solve the riots, which include eight prisoners and are confined to a single wing.
Cops are being treated for minor injuries at the scene.
The prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff were directed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, police for public order and peace were called to the prison to deal with serious riots in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (may be beneficial for drylands)
Tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but it is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwestern region, risking sudden flooding.
The state meteorological station has already issued warnings of possible sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, to south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Sight Lake City.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct path through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones held the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona's border."
The latest models of the State Center for Hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the province of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Rockies Mountains and the Great Basin will probably have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas of sudden flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is affected by drought.
According to the US Sushi Watcher, nearly 40 percent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," saidweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path led to soils everywhere on the Lower California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with a hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of a maximum of 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm comes in contact with cooler waters in the Pacific and shrinks.
Rains are therefore expected in Mexico, with the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Utah until late evening Tuesday.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or her remains are the very heavy rains in Lower California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," the State Centre for Hurricanes said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and torrential floods, as well as landslides in mountain regions.
Midsamer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Exelzior Terrace on Midsamer Norton about 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is in "stable" condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police said Avon and Somerset.
The police asked if anyone had the cell phone footage from the incident, to step forward.
Trump said Kavano "feels the Democratic Party's worst malice and anger".
"The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to reject the most cruel and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Cavanaugh "feeled the Democratic Party's worst malice and anger" during his nomination.
Cavanaugh witnessed before the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Kristina Blasi Ford’s accusations that he had committed sexual assault on her a few decades ago when he was a teenager.
Ford testified to the hearing and her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Cavanaugh that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a flawless public service record," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavano's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' exit in the early elections.
"Another five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and hinder".
The first key vote for Kavano's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people died, many were driven by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves of heights of 6 meters (18 feet) hit the shore of the sunset, leading many to certain death and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5 earthquake, it hit a tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and were not running away immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a BNPB spokesman for disaster relief in Indonesia's Jakarta briefing.
"The tsunami did not come alone, dragging cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs of the air released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The ensuing tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The earthquake series was met in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the energy released by the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow shore, may increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "abundance" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found stuck under the roof of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said victims and injuries could rise along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a announcement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing us that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came about at the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared by social media, a man on the top floors of a building can be heard screaming insanity, warning people on the street down for the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water clasps on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami triggered a power cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened only for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo was planning to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami rose over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala safely arrived in the town of Palu, where employees were sheltered in embassies from the courtyard of their office, they traveled through scenes of the wilderness, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even while relief teams began dark attempts to help the disaster, some complained that foreign relief experts were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to come if the disaster site is declared a zone of national disaster.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," said Aulia Aryannis, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can receive international assistance, but there is no status yet."
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the wonders that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers rescued a woman who had been stuck under a blow job for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paraglider team, trained two of the missing paragliderists for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
The others stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gandon related how, when she began circulating the news of Roa Roa's demolition in the congregation of paragliders, he desperately sent messages to whatsApp to the Palu contestants who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended only with a gray sign of discipline instead of a son.
"I think that means that messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 when they filled the ATM at Newport's Key
Thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from an employee at Brink's who added an ATM to Newport's cabin, according to a Newport police station press statement.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM into the fun complex and prepared to supplement it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a statement.
While he was busy, another man came running from Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
The Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to a statement, but the police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact the NYPD at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yi
Rapper Kanje West changed his name to Yei.
The change posted on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kane West."
Forty - one - year - old West carried her nickname for a while and used her nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurred just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to decline for "emotional reasons," the show creator said.
Although he used it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West earlier said the word had religious significance for him.
"I think "Yi" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio operator Big Boy.
"What does it mean to be you, I am us, it is us.
He left Kanye, which means the only one, except Yei, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a show of who we are."
He is one of the numerous known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Paf Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he published his preference for the names Love and Brader Love (Love and Brother Love).
A former West associate, J.Z., also uses his name with or without a cartoon and all large letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises he won't use the military on civilians.
Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of the students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that "never will use the military to reprisal the Mexican people".
The military fired at peaceful demonstrators in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research resources in the field, said the investor and practitioner for AI, Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States does not have a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it strives to be number 1 in innovations for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The doubling of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area would be made by the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invest in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 80s at Carnegie Melon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest ranking U.S. player in the country and later served as director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Li thanked the previous US government technology competitions for the challenge of robotics by the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when the next match would be to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China who takes the academic leaders, it's the corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that "green cards" should automatically be offered to doctors of artificial intelligence science," he said.
The National Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Science Foundation finances people in academic institutions similarly the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other government organisations distribute money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should cover partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of an Executive Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called "AI Next".
As far as NSF is concerned, they currently invest more than $100m a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation requiring the creation of a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has been ineffective for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
People in Macedonia voted in Sunday's referendum on whether to change her name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its demands for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbour is the right of its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine Macedonia's ethnic identity for most of the Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign questioned whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for validity of the referendum.
The referendum note issue said, "Are you for NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Name-changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that that price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities until 13.00.
However, the turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, a voters in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their vote in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, opening the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene and chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from behind," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the result "yes" would be "recognition of our future".
The poll, published by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia last Monday, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma shows that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote yes.
To succeed in the referendum, the turnout should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since they came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City spent all of Brighton's defense naked
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly defeated Brighton's defense in a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine assailant received a launch in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
It quickly passed between three defense players on Brighton before entering the open ground.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "greens".
Walked around a defensive player before he ran a few others on the edge of Brighton's 16th.
He then handed left him, to Sterling.
An English assailant used his first approach to the 16th to return the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton's right leg, Matthew Ryan, with a single hit on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky you scored a goal at that moment."
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blues" gave them Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister of the League.
The goal came in at 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a wonderful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a couple of times before he took Sterling to the distant article.
The attack on the "heavenly blues" took the ball into the net before it went out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a competition of the League of Champions group at 12.55 on Tuesday in the Rhine-Neckar arena, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play coyleer against the Rockies.
Since Nashnels was eliminated by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But always the Competive Sherzer hopes to stand in the central square Sunday against Colorado Rocky, but only if there are still implications for a playoff for the Rockies team, which are leading a single game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rocky's team had at least a jocker for a place with a 5-2 victory over Nashnels on Friday night, but they're still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we are not playing for anything, at least we will be able to throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any moment I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still needs to announce a starter for a week, but they are reportedly inclined to allow Sherzer to throw in such a situation.
Sherzer, who will start on the 34th road, coached tossing on Thursday and throws his usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right hand is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike points at 220 2/3 innings this season.
Mittings for Trump in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation regarding Bret Kavano's election to the Supreme Court as he discussed the importance of Republican exit in the early elections.
"All we have done so far will be placed on the dice in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big – I don't run, but I'm really fighting, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Continue, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means available to them, seeing wickedness, wickedness.
They don't care who they're gonna hurt when they have to run over to gain power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and hinder".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "the wrathful, the wicked, the disgraceful and the untruthful."
He mentioned Senator Diana Feynstein from the ranks of the Democrats, set up by the Senate Judicial Committee, by name, to which the audience reacted with a cry of outrage.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Ah, what.
No, and no, I'm waiting a little – it was a very bad speech on the body – the worst speech on the body I've ever seen."
Labs no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion are not tolerated
When the activists of Momentum voted against me in my local party, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last member of the Labour Party parliament to be told that we are not welcome – just because it expresses its opinion.
My colleague-parlementer Joan Ryan received similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticised me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Eastern Labour Party meeting of Nottingham stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party parliament, Friday night council meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately today, this is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a "fair, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if indeed, ever began.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged as acceptable to party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when I felt that we had previously shared a similar political opinion, they expected me to completely change my thinking and take positions which I would never otherwise have taken, whether it was national security or the EU's internal security.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical abuse of social media that calls for condemnation, rejection of the centre's policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the labyrinth party.
And I'm not the only one with this kind of experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have a great fear of professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face a number of sexist or racist harassment every day, but they never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin argued last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for "no confidence" or change of rules of selection, the party becomes closer.
I have received many tips over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not be so loud, and then “everything will be all right. ”
But that's not the reason I came to politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the neglect of the Tacher government, which literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who were most needed, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Eastern Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the demand on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country goes to Braggsite to hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to spend my time and energy loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have a message that is not about Nottingham Momentum, but about my electors, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how many condemning threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will discourage me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of the Eastern Nottingham Parliament.
Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: the undefeated Ear goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the final score to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ear earned the triumph in this wonderful party competition on the day of the Scottish Championship in football.
They are now on top of the table, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
Finally, everything is due to their superior defenses, as well as their better-used chances, which the home team carried out, and Coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: “Thanks to Ear, they took better advantage of their chances than we do. ”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute point, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Air the advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for the Vorrors game, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo extended Ear’s lead with foam, earlier, right at halftime, he scored a point, converting a solo point to achieve 17-5 for Ear in rescue.
But Melrose started his second half well, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by the Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruard Nott, who was taken out on the stretchers, and from the beginning, Ear continued to torment himself with the point of Stafford McDowell, converted by Klimo.
Air's D.C., Blair McFerson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose paid for an extra guy with an unconverted point of Bruce Colvin at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team returned, and when Struan Hachinson received a yellow card to knock Klimo out without the ball, McFerson took a tacduan from the foam line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did almost from the beginning, after Kyle Row took David Armstrong's strike and sent wingman Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
Still Game Star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiran seems ready to move to the catering industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, where he is a screenwriter and plays along with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duoto announced that the next ninth season would be the last season and it seems that Kirnan is planning for life after Kreggling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kirnan was trying to engage in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in a covert-flanked Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a blue sea flag.
Sailing bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued with the motto: “The sea is ours.
It's our duty to return."
Throughout the land of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost in behalf of Chile in the bloody 19th - century conflict of resources is still fresh, as is the desire to sail again after the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the biggest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the momentary, spirit of unity and serenity and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Kalsadija, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the international court on large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of alternating talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to Bolivia's sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia of indigenous origin, facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, also depends quite on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he solemnly said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge in favour of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge in their favor.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate territory to Chile and has indicated that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And for the past four years, they may have embezzled Bolivia’s cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
The military rhetoric of Morales undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, a Bolivian official in The Hague, rejected the idea that making a court ruling is unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit", he said.
Kalsadia also rejected that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the problem with the sea as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says there won't be nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep their promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of rebooting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Young Un.
Ri says it is "fiction" to believe that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to the declarative end of the Korean war will bring Severna Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing with the Declaration without Pyongyang to take significant disarmament measures first.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris fashion reviews reveal the latest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest stores in your neighborhood
If you want to improve the size of your hat collection or completely block the sun, then don't keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of crazy big hats about their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the fashion style set up in Paris.
The most impractical hats were launched Instagram this summer, and these designers sent out their creations that fall into the eye of the track.
The piece highlighted by Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide rim in the form of feathers that flooded the model's head.
The other too large additions included lube with circuses, a magical hat, and even pineapple, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creation looked like a diving equipment full of glasses and a diving tube, and the other looked like a melted corned ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style trackers predict that giant hats can come to the stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", the straw hat with a stabbing wide two feet that all from Ryan to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind the too impractical hat spread through social media sent another large creation along the track, a straw bag for a beach about the same size as the height of the model it was pulling.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a pack of raffia and a white leather handle, was the piece highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus on Fashion Week in Paris.
Stillist of the famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has generated so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Needed for Global Citizens · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results of the tests, which only reinforces with individual and group success in sport, art, music and other community commitments.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide their students and parents with the best service.
Independent schools seek to train their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement adapted school programmes, we see modern languages continue to be popular and desirable as an electoral object in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, he will make him haughty.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will hit him in his soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent test results, we can see that languages surpass all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages achieved a higher score of "5+".
The data collected from 74 schools in SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher score of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an election subject, are seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes, as well as elsewhere.
The CC Committee's Employment and Skills Survey in 2014 noted that because of employers' failure to fill jobs, 17 percent were due to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more language - seeking jobs, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such life skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give priority to the polyglot before competition.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken by more than ten percent, that is, 15 percent of the people.
Therefore, investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered the most important in the OK when they look to the future by 2020 as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be a number of languages that can be chosen in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare their children and equip them with the skills needed for success, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this has to be transformed into schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
‘Il faut bien le ferer’ (it must be done).
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will lead Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday.
Waiting was almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, announced James will play in the first game in Sunday's Presidium against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But as long as he's playing, it's still not decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his six-game schedule plans before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the preseason in this phase of my career to prepare," he said.
U-tube channel for Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of mittings as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five scheduled duties in the coming week, including visits to favored places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the blanks in the Supreme Court is at a standstill, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because Republicans may lose control in Congress by voting in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you view it online?
Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 a.m., Eastern Coast Time Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump rally in West Virginia via live on YouTube.
This week, it is likely that Trump will appeal to the hearing of the man who nominated him for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, which has become tense because of allegations of sexual misconduct, with an expected postponement of the Senate's vote by a week, as the FBI's investigation continues.
A primary objective of the round of mittings is to help Republicans win a coup for the November elections.
Hence, President Trump's campaign said that these five mites next week are aimed at "instigating volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important on its agenda that the president will travel to the more federal states with the beginning of the tough campaign season," a spokesman from Trump's campaign told Reuters, who refused to be named.
Appointed at the Wesbanko arena in Willing, the rally tonight can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, according to Metro from West Virginia.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrisei that the president has to come to improve the popularity of polls," said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Raider 2018: US team shows courage in the struggle to keep hopes alive at the start of individual competitions on Sunday
After three single - page seasons, the four of us on Saturday afternoon may have been just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The curvature of happiness is a fully invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
Who would say that happiness is now?
"They had six-point leadership, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky I suppose," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
The Europeans have the advantage, of course, of leading four points and another twelve games.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the sails although they have a satisfactory incentive, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each achieved three points of four.
The exam was excellent and leads with an example.
Those strong calls of celebration grew stronger during his game, with a key blow leading to a leveling of four when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His stroke they won the 15th match was greeted with a similar cry, so he tells you he believes the US team is not out of the game.
"You just have to get deeper and take care of your game," Spit said.
That's all any player has left now.
18 holes to reach a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but wonderful, Europe's duo is four out of four and can't make mistakes.
Molywood was the only couple with no bad punches on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad punches on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine on Friday morning.
This series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who will win Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, except Flitwood or Molinari.
They both prefer different holes at the same time.
However, talks on European glory remain unwarranted.
Bubba Watson and Web Simson quickly dealt with Sergio García, the morning double pair hero, when he joined up with Alex Noren.
A missed blow and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole from which they never managed to get out.
Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to see from close to each other's interaction, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't listen to and the way the strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus took a significant lead in the last day, but the four season also showed that the US team could fight though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans led 10-6 on the last day of Raider Cup
Europe will take a solid advantage on the last day of the Raider Cup after Saturday's leadership in double pairs and fours from 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Flintwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tiger Woods was struggling to take the lead so far on Le Golf National on four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who struggled to keep the trophy you lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the US team that had a lot of failures in double couples this morning and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans offered more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but they couldn't reach the lead.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points of 12 individual competitions Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flintwood is the first European novice to win four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, called Molywood after a sensational weekend, are the second pair ever to win four points in the first four competitions in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After "smashing" Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played great and beat the exhausted Woods and US rookie Bryson Dashambo with an even more pronounced 5&4 score.
Woods, who made it through two swords on Saturday, played great at times, but now he's lost 19 of the 29 doubles and fours and sevens in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning double couples, returned as a partner of Henrik Stanson in fours with the 2–1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka -- ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not after all that pleasant, windy day south-west of Paris.
The three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a measure for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Puller in double couples and came back later to beat Puller and Rory McClerroy with 4&3 in fours, but lost on the initials, two holes.
Just twice in the history of the Raider Cup, a certain team has recovered from a lack of four points in the individual game, although as holder of the title, Furik’s team was satisfied with an even result to keep the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the weekly counterattack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says "no chance" to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened mistrust in the United States and that there was no chance the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as the halting of nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing itself to proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States." he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, he will not trust our national security and under such conditions there is no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to nuclear disarmament "in the phase", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for taking the steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongian did in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in general at the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim undertook to work for "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to impose strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S.A. insists on "nuclear disarmament primarily" and increases the level of sanctions to achieve their goal by coercion and even opposes "the declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can kneel on our knees is a lost dream of people who do not know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have ended in such a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the U.N General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles on the American mainland was inevitable after "My Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened "complete destruction" of North Korea, much more praised by Kim for his courage to take steps for disarmament, but said that much work remained to be done and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for it, saying "Does it take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter?"
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking steps.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue completely and without exception until full, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council unanimously stepped up sanctions on North Korea from 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pjongang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but last time it didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea only a few hours later because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has committed itself to meeting with Moon this month for disarming the missile plant, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for are the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalising relations with Washington
Harvard Students Visit Courses to Get Enough Vacation
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates to sleep more in order to fight the growing cat-culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the leading university in the world often know nothing about basic self - care.
Charles Chazzler, professor of medical medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the British Women's Hospital, designed a course he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving talks about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the lecture, a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping -- which surprised me," he said about a Telegraph.
The course that was offered for the first time this year explains to students how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic results, and improves overall well-being.
Paul Barra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a student home where students press coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic results and the importance of routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn about how a long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart and brain attacks, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus, with interactive icons, then urges participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," added Professor Chazzler.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and in addition, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid obesity, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaizler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course in the entire student town.
He hopes the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competent institution.
Professor Chowzler recommended that students consider setting an alarm about when to go to bed, and about when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "Blue Light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which shifts the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal took down Gerard's men
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Stephen Gerard's team to Livingstone 1-0 in defeat.
Ibrox's team wanted to register its first victory after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the confused leading team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga suggested seven minutes before half-time, and Rangers' placement lost inspiration and a chance to level it up.
Now Rangers have fallen to sixth, and Livingstone has gone to third, and they're only behind Hibernian by the difference in heads.
There may be additional problems that Rangers have been waiting for since the L.A. Judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after he was obviously hit with an object from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the team Aer spent in the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 of Livingstone who won a point with Harts last week and would be happy in the way his well-trained position choked the opponents at every chance.
Rangers may have dominated the position above the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score two minutes after the start when the first time that Menga lost Scott Pittman to the goal of Alan McGregor, but the middle-order player missed the chance.
Then a blow from the distance of Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defence partner, Alan Litgow, could only play openly in the defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their last-third game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have received a penalty at the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not give a sign of approval to the Colombian appeal.
Rangers managed to score only two shots to the goal in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalie Liam Kelly didn't get tired of his head punching Lasana Coulibally and Ovy Edaria's weak blow.
Although the beginning of Livingstone's 34th minute might have been the opposite of the course of the game, no one can deny that they earned according to their game.
Again, Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' stroke.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cold head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick effect when the wingman passed over Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with the blockade.
But Livingstone managed to lure guest players to play the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgo and Hackett catching up on a lot of long additions.
Holt's team could have extended the lead to the end of the game, but McGregor got up and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head on the horn.
Ranger's replacement, Glenn Middleton had another penalty request after he crashed with Jacobs, but Thompson approved us again.
Almanah: Geiger Counter Inventor · Global Voices
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, a.m. 136 years ago, and WE RECOMMEND... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, it has become the main stronghold of science, the gaiger numeral has become the main stronghold of popular culture, as in the 1950 "Colorado Bell", in which these seemingly unreliable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear:
Man: “What is that again? ”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emit radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “That must be jumping right now! ”
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name and then exists.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "look away" cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "look away" cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize stray cells as part of the treatment.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their alteration in the laboratory
You can “see ” protein honor in many cancers and then be returned to the body
The trial vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize stray cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can "see" protein honor in many cancers called HER2 and then return them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of Betseda National Cancer Institute of America, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "enhanced the growth of several cancers", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach by extracting immunological cells from patients and "teaching them" as to target cancer cells works in treating certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Tramp out, wearing a drop with his motto, after Saturday night's performance live.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was observed in the studio during a live show Saturday night, after a useless performance praised by US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the performance of the third song that night, called the City of Spirits, in which he wore a hat with an inscription To do America Slavna Again, he began to criticize the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"Frequently when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday night's live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked with Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee, related to the charges of a sexual assault on Christine Blacy Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of the West incident was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had been hard past the stage because of his drop.
"Behind the stage, they made fun of me.
They said, "Don't show up with that droplet."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in the sinking place, he said, according to Washington Egzeminer.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sinking place?" he said he would "set up his superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments attracted public outrages at least twice, and the evening show crew seemed embarrassed, reported the Varayetti, one man told the publisher: "We're missing the entire studio."
West was brought as a replacement at the last minute for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing the song "I Love It" dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPSAD, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for having been sent to the crowd."
But the hostess of the show Karen Hunter tweeted on Twitter that West "was himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") for which I believe he accepts a wider ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Kane West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Didi, also known as Paf Dedi, Paf and P. Didi.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dog has the name Snoop Lyon and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name into a symbol, and then into an artist formerly known as Prince.

The Star of the series Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington, attacked toxic manhood
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman as Jon Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series Game of the Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a cat hero, when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they must be strong to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times culture section, Keith said he believed that "something is wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #Segregating era.
Kit, who recently married a star from the Game of Trons, Rosie Leslie, also admitted 31, that there are "strong feelings" on that issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment -- where did we make mistakes with the man?," he said.
"What do men learn when they grow up about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic men, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is born, but what is learned?
What learns from TV and what on the street makes young boys feel that they must have a certain aspect of masculinity?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the continuation of the Game of Thrones when the series will end next summer, saying that he had "ended with battles and horses".
Since November, Keith will be performing the restoration of Sam Shepard's Real West, a story about a movie producer and his brother as a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he was thinking about meeting Rose's wife is the best thing that came out of the game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose was playing Ygritte, a character who had a love attraction with the character of Keith, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won Emi's awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/Sida: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China published a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and Sid.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new events have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and Sid in China grew by 100,000 people.
Moving HIV through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is a large community.
Because of the conservative values of the country, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data provided by a member of staff associated with a Republican party senator as "dangerous lies" and "controversy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters rejected charges Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal information to three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims were "ultra-right" sympathizers and web sites.
" Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes home address and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hech of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Bret Kavano, nominated the Supreme Court judge.
The information provided appeared shortly after Kavano's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redstreet have announced that the IP address identifying the source of the announcement is linked to Waters' office and information about a Waters staff member is published, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and represent an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those untruthful and false accusations - is not in any way responsible for the information provided.
Unhappy accusations are completely false and are absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"These denials are nervous," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that it has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Democrats associated with Judge Kavano, who was indicted by critics because he seemed too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in midterm elections, also tweeted.
"If it's true, that's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed "the relevant institutions and police of false claims.
"We will allow offenders to be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
The thought of Johnny English Attacks Again -- undermines Rowan Atkinson's spy fraud
Now it's traditional to look for elements of Briggsitis in every new film with a British connection, and that seems to apply to this renewal of the franchise of the fraud, action comedy Johnny English -- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was reborn in 2011 with Johnny English: reborn.
Is careful mocking the subject of how clearly we are nowhere going to be the new export option of the nation?
In spite of all, the face with big eyes and a lot of makeup on the incompetent Johnny English got a license to "drive" things for the second time -- his name basically means that he's a comic creation with a wide range made for cinema audiences in places where no English is spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, in spite of his bizarre efforts for a careful glamorous slightly similar to Clouseau, has the drawings of Mr. Bin and a part of the boy playing a note from the song Cochia at the fire ceremony opening the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
Its basis is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in the now forgotten TV commercial of Barclays, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I liked it a lot when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor's fins hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially because the "serious" film brands such as 007 and the impossible Mission contain the elements of the comedy themselves.
The humor looks like it's meant for children instead of adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy accidents aren't as inventive and focused as they are the untapped Bean of Atkinson.
The topic that goes on all the time is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated the super secret network of spies in Britain, exposing the identities of all British field agents to the disappointment of an official agent -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a more pompous and combative figure and is already suffering from a total meltdown of political non-popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best in this Quazi-Tereza-Mei image, but there is nothing in the script that would work.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling yourself Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a private school, but "black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good boys here, when English offers a school of spying that resembles a rock academy.
English was quickly called to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former co-worker Bow, who plays by Ben Miller.
Bow is now married to a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up all things in the Royal Secret Service, they go back into action and meet the fatally beautiful Ofelia Buletova, a character playing by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the perilous influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walta, a daring Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their drive of absurd actions: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; make a waste after they smuggle themselves on the luxury yacht of Walt; and English starts a real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of Walt's house.
All brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and loud as it is, there's quite a baby TV in the whole movie.
Nice temperate things.
And as with other movies with Johnny English, I can't help but think: can't the British film industry play a role for Rowan Atkinson to use his talent?
Labors deny that the British plan is to work four days a week, but to be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labyrin's party will think of a radical plan that would put the British working four days a week -- but they'll be underpaid for five.
The party reportedly wants companies' bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three - day weekend — but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "response" with the party's economic agenda and with the country's plans to be more favourable to workers.
The transition in a four-day working week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way of bringing workers benefits from changes in the economy.
A highly ranking party member told Sunday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a working week of four days is a pursuit consistent with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, aspirations are not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, "The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party does not consider such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labourist conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of "personless directors" and "professors" in utilities.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour Government could make "deductions" for unethical behaviour.
He also confirmed the planned workers to become part of the board of companies and to set up Inclusive Property Funds with which 10 per cent of private firm capital would belong to employees, who would be able to take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lyndsey Graham, John Kennedy making a statement about "60 Minutes" about whether an FBI investigation into Cavanaugh could reconsider
An FBI investigation into charges against Judge Bret Kavano has postponed the final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and has raised the issue of whether the findings of the bureau could rethink some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview published on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them reconsider.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think I understand," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavano.
I called him after this, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, appeared carved in stone.
"My decision has been made for Bret Cavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied energetically," Graham added, referring to Christine Blacy Ford.
"Everyone she names could not confirm.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen festival and did you do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City will be hosted by the Global Citizen festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now being held on the seventh track, and the Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy the performances of names such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group hoping to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (except if they do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), participants have to perform several tasks or "acts" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a telephone call or some other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is he because he has 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to do something or just another case of "click-activism" -- people who feel they're making a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped encourage world leaders to announce dedication and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and predictions resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that congregations of funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of Ishrana, a partnership of investors and implementers, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children exploit their potential", which promised to provide $35 million for Rwanda to help with insufficient food in the country after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition, a landmark in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of Ishrana's Moc said before the gathered people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities were taken in connection with calls to improve maternal and child nutrition in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, Ishratta's Power, which would cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
How do you answer one of the frequently asked questions on their web site "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens replied: “It will be a long and difficult road - we will never succeed.
But as well as the big civil and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mandez, Cardie B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy to disrupt Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington can "use the Navy if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinki has discovered, as Washington Egzeminer quoted.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria -- named where it operates after an invitation to a legitimate government -- is a front for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they're in the Middle East is because of energy shopping, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the seaways remain open and if it is necessary with the blockade to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addressed an event organised by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a selfless group representing itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he was effective as well.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stake and replacing the fuel," he said, while Russia was talking about "one awkward pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after Trump's administration launched a mission to boost natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step aside from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, from Berlin, has made Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2, which is worth $11 billion, should double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandar Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American stance has been resisted by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemf, the first man of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully consider" whether to run for president in 2020, Senator Massachusetts said
A senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after midterm elections.
During a meeting in the city congregation in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was thinking of running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our non-functional government, which means a woman on the forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president."
Warren evaluated President Donald Trump's work during a meeting in the town hall and said he "guides the country in the wrong direction.
"I am too worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano.
In a message on Twitter Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that a large number of voters in its election unit think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not be running, according to a study by the University of Saffolk/Boston Globe Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent support such candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Dewal Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a potential nomination and 48 per cent against it.
Other known names from the democratic party discussed for the 2020 nomination are former Deputy President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin is talking about Trek Paylin's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's rally.
Trek Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he applied in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he's returned, I know how other families feel torn up because of the more traumatic syndrome and wounds our soldiers are returning to," she said in front of a rally audience for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paileen called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "they come back a little different, they come back solid, they come back and wonder if there's any respect for what they and their companions from aviation, and any other member of the military gave it to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence with assaulting a female, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman in Vasili.
18 federal states, Washington City support dispute over new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new US policy that prevents the giving of asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the Washington city filed a petition to the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who contests politics, envisaging En-Bi-Ci News.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace case against Parliament, who submitted the US Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state defender Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from where many asylum claims in the United States originate, as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annuls the Board's decision on immigration complaints from 2014 allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City's attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of passing laws at the level of federal states, federal and international levels".
"The federal law requires all asylum requirements to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle," according to a petition to the court (amicus curiae).
Moreover, the advocates in the letter argue that the policy preventing immigration entry is harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary labour force".
Lawyer Jeff Seasons ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sesns said in presenting the policy on 11 June.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu because the number of victims doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," Risa Kusuma's 35-year-old mother said as she comforted her male baby in an evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clear water."
Residents return to their destroyed homes and choose from their alleged objects to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who had fractures on his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside for frequent consecutive minor earthquakes.
Tears came into his eyes when he described the severe earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, so I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, but then come quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador blames China for "painting" with "promotional advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the US daily, listing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump discussed last Wednesday's paid addition to China Daily in the De Moine Register -- the most sold newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of interfering in the US congress on November 6th, China rejected the indictment.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked a joint US services for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalation campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise trade promotions, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which they align import tariffs with each other.
China's revenge tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were directed at exporters from federal states like Iowa, which support Trump's republican party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly edition of De Moine Register, "now doubles the harassment with propaganda advertising in our free press."
"In the decade of propaganda, the government of China misuses the U.S. free speech tradition and free media by putting ads in the de Moine Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you will not see the genuine reflection that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the Chinese Communist Party's firm hand," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most widely read newspapers in China rejected his bid to publish" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was about.
Republicans distance from women's voices before mid-term elections, due to the debacle with Kavano, analysts warn
Since many Republicans cannot see or defend Brett Kavano's nomination at the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially for women in the upcoming midterm elections of the mandate.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already said they want to proceed with the vote.
Of such things there is no turning back," Grant Richer, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, wrote for Hill, in a column published Saturday.
Richer said he doubted the FBI's pressure to investigate Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) will be satisfied with calming the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, told Washington D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "Neumbries Come!" in a protest in the Senate Hall, when Republicans, who have control in the Legal Affairs Committee, decided to proceed with the Kavano nomination despite Dr. Christine Blacy Ford's testimony, Mik said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site, said.
"People already say they're tall; that's true.
But they can be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court judge's candidate, analysts suggest there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to EN-Bi-Si news.
"It is not only about voting in the commission or the last vote or Kavano going to the hearing, it is also about the way the Republicans handled it and treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that assists in the election of Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans are divided over who to trust after witnessing to Ford and Cavanaugh, although more are accepting the first page.
A new U-Gov poll shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they definitely or probably believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Cavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent felt the same way about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least some others, of Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee, under oath last week that Kavano in a drunken state attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court judge of showing her genitalia at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
World Network inventor plans to start a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Team Burners-Lee, World Network inventor starts with a start-up business that claims to be a rival on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrapt, is a company that was built on the Soleid Open Code platform on Berners-Lee.
Soleid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lee was joking that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Soleid's technology to allow people to create their own "Internet data warehouse" or short-circuit DS.
It may contain lists of contacts, to-dos, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluk, Slek and Spotifai all available to one viewer at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data warehouse on the Internet is that it depends only on the user who has access to certain types of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
Inrapt's idea, according to the executive director of John Bruce's company, is to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Soleid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Burners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers with a project work contract and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrapt's website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a full change where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a press release published on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that "the Inrapt mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Soleid."
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Consortium of the World Network of the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
Lately, Burners-Lee has been an influential speaker in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even when starting with Inrapt, Burners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the internet," Burners-Li added.
Bernard Van: A famous bear on a Victorian cross since World War I · Global Voices
The only Church of England priest who received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Honor Bernard Van was granted the recognition on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Belengliz and Lehaukur.
Yet, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military distinction.
A Comorian stone was discovered by his two grandkids at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "an amazing symbol" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Qwentin "Niz very thick fog and under a strong fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the places where he fired himself and "the greatest courage" led ahead, before attacking himself a cannon nest and incapacitating three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I know I'll never be able to do, but it's something that makes us modest."
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Van said that "it is a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people".
Fans of combined martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got Pepa Prase
Imagine, you've been awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and you're not gonna be able to watch the main event.
San Jose's list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were thrilled when the channel moved to Pepa Prasse.
Some were not impressed when they stayed awake until the early hours of the fight.
One of the Twitter fans described the transfer of children's cartoons as "some sick joke".
"The law was such that at 6 a.m. that the content was inappropriate, so they had to be transferred to a children's program," said Dave Schwarz, Vice President of Belator for Marketing and Communication, when he was asked about the transmission.
"Pepa pig", yes"
The company's president, Belator Scott Kuker, said they would work on a schedule that would include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think when I think about re-launching, I think we might be able to find a solution," Kuker said.
"But there is six o'clock in the morning Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, we got a lot of messages on the transfer, and none of them were favored.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We'll limit the number to five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more for the fans and we overdid it.
That's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discos: Tom Daley felt "inferior" over sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to high school that "all are not like me"
Speaking on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, on the first television show Disney on a desert island, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presentation of the long-term Kirsti Young show took several months off because of the disease.
Showing up as a role model in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, those feelings of lower value and variety were things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two bronze medal Olympics became a prominent supporter of the LGBT Campaigns and used its performance at the Australian Commons this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "surprising me".
Daley married the Oscar, who is 20 years older last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much early," he went to the first 14-year-old Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his eyes" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was connected to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept death and one of the last things he asked were whether they had tickets to London 2012 — because he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about all my life -- jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song — the pride of Heather Small — that turned into his head in the preparations for the Olympics and that he was still tired of.
The discos on the desert island of B-Bi-Ci Radio 4 are Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michelson, he's not in shape. He was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
USman Phil Michelson will set a record Sunday when he plays the 47th Raider Cup, but he will have to change the form to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Michelson, who played the bienal event, the record 12th time, was sent to the bench of Captain Jim Furik during Saturday's double couples and fours.
Instead of being at the center of attention, as often represented by the United States, the five - time winner, he divided the time to cheer up and practice his game, the range, in hopes of correcting what was quiet.
He was never the best leader, not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for Le Golf National's narrow playground, where the long-term harsh blows are a regular punishment for neglect.
And if the field itself isn't terrifying enough, Michelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces the exact champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who is playing pair with the rookie Tommy Flitwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual games, begin to struggle, the Michelson game can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see another.
"He fully understands the role he had today, touched me on the back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's part of the celebrities and he's given a lot about these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't picture him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went away and we thought we had to do it that way.
He likes to play, like everyone else."
Michelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played game of the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 lost games and seven-and-seven, although Furik said his presence had something immaterial on the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's sensitive, he wants to joke with people and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think the younger players were playing with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He's offering a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that significant leadership in front of individual competitions on the last day of the Raider Cup can easily be turned into an incomparable position.
The Danish debuted at a game in Walderama in 1997, when the Steve Ballesteros-led guy had five points ahead of the Americans, but "they crossed the target line only with the noses", with the smallest lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had a great lead in Walderama; we had a great lead in Brookline when we lost in Walderama, when we won for a while," Bjorn said, as you watched the 2018 class win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a lead from 10-6 on Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're going ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play as you should.
This is not over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and the focus remains on it.
All the time I'm saying, I'm focusing on 12 players in our team, but we're fully aware of the opponent's side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn added, satisfied with the results of his players on a heavy golf course: “I don’t want to make early assessments on that issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow, individual games await us, and that is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, they test all abilities like golfers.
It's the message you have to send to the players to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furik will require players to play better individually than they played in pairs, exceptions are Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furick himself was at both ends of the changes in the last day, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment goes in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the middle matches.
We set up the line properly, and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of resisting first and facing Rory McClerroy's most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Polter, in the most important part of the order.
"I decided to do this way with the boys because I think that's how we'll cover everything," Bjorn said about choosing individual games.
New German warship postponed again
The latest frigate of the German navy was to be shipped in 2014 to replace obsolete warships since the Cold War, but it will not happen until at least next year due to the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
Delivery of Rhineland-Faltz, the new class leader frigates Baden-Vitemberg, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Zeit, calling for a spokesman for the military.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the issue after delivery has hindered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Vitemberg class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the outdated Bremen frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stelt technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic track.
Among other important features is less maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships -- which should enable Germany to have power across the oceans -- will be obsolete by the time they enter the service, Di Zeit notes.
The frigate with unfortunate fate F125 reached the front lines last year, when the German navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to Blom and Vos Shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of key "software and hardware defects" for which the warship was useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Vitemberg class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half of the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also turns out that the ship is dramatically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Faltz weighs 7,000 tonnes and is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
Besides the troublesome hardware, the cost of the entire project -- including crew training -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- an increase of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings about Germany's reduced naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, confirmed that the navy "is running out of ships that can be deployed".
The representative said the problem had worsened over time, because the old ships had been withdrawn from service, but ships were not provided for replacements.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Vitemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Bat’s Secret Life
A new property survey is being carried out in the Scottish mountains to find out how bats use the area in search of food.
There is hope that discoveries will provide answers to the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help to conduct future protection activities.
The study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular and soprano lilacs, as well as brown bats with long ears and daubenton bats at Inverou Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities during the season.
En-Each-Es personnel and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
Experimental analysis of the sounds of all the recordings will determine the frequency depending on the bat's species.
Then a map of habitats will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, an adviser to nature conservation in En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of living are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
Such information will help to determine the benefits of living management, such as the creation of meadows, and how best to maintain the forests of bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect beds and the loss of housing.
Windmills and lights also pose risks, as well as sticky bands for flies and some chemical treatments for construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
Yet, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, who cares about more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of country in the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, bed inspection, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even adopts the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at Triv properties in Damfris and Galovius, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property Manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"This way in Triv we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are a lot of unknown things about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us find out more about what they need to make progress."
He stresses that it is important to check whether there are bats before renovations of properties are carried out because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and illegal to kill, torture, or disturb, or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish bat protection officer in Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and other species, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo dropped rape charges, and lawyers sue the German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "false news," and added that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spigel, which announced the charges.
Portugal and Juventus are charged with raping an American woman named Katherine Majorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 to stop talking about the incident, Der Spigel said on Friday.
Speaking live on Instagram to 142 million followers, hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was presented today is false news," the five-time gold ball conqueror said in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spigel for the charges, which they called "an unacceptable transfer of doubts from private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc said the player would seek damages for "moral damages in line with the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the indictment incident took place in June 2009 in the hotel and the Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the documents filed before the Clark courthouse in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 percent" "good boy", but fell below that "one percent".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken pictures of her injuries to the hospital, but later agreed to a treaty without judicial participation because she was afraid of retaliation and was concerned that she would be "sacred publicly".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to redefine the treaty because there are traumas to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join the Real Madrid of Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juventus with a 100m-euro deal.
Braggsitis: Britain will "always regret" losing car manufacturers · Global Voices
Britain will "always regret" if it loses the status of a world leader in the production of cars after Bragzit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota-Britania had said about the BBC, that if Britain left the EU without an agreement it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
Japan's car manufacturer said that the impact of the border stops in the case of Bragzit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston -- manufactured by Toyota Auris and Aventis -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"According to me, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a stop in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about how cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-Ve and Jaguar Land Rover, would operate when leaving the EU without an agreement.
Be-Em-You, for example, says she's going to close her mini factory in Oxford a month after Briggsit.
The main concerns are what car manufacturers call the risks to the logistics chain in the case of Briggsit without a deal.
Toyota's production line works according to the "right-time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a break in the border that industry believes could cause delays and shortcomings in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory supply at the Derbyshir factory, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "rightly done to avoid such border checks".
"We should have a deal. We should have the best deal that will allow us not only success in which we will enjoy the present, but to seize this opportunity," he told Radio 4 today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also other producers are that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce factory competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Civalris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union representative at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In the light of my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman, "We have established a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House said
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Public Advocate Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week" as the fight continues on Bret Kavano's nomination for a Supreme Court judge, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who is investigating Russian voter interference, ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and potential law violations by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby threaten Miller's independence, he has been stirring up rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein was thinking of wearing a camera camera for the Trump talks and the possibility of removing the president over the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "I would not like to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Justice Committee's hearing in which both Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blacy Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI regarding charges against Kavano, which would further postpone the Senate vote.
Trump's secretary of press, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
On the question of meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting has not yet been established, could be held this week, and could be postponed for another week in view of all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things are going, and I'm always trying to get the press properly informed."
Some journalists contest the claim: Sanders has not given a briefing to reporters in the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Saunders said the small number of briefins did not owe disapproval to the "great influence" of television journalists, though he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great impact."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president is organising more sessions of questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We have reviewed those numbers."
There will still be bribs, Saunders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States questions, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more often, and you're witnessing that we've been doing it all the time over the past few weeks, and the talks with the president of the United States will replace the briefing for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this was the case with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance to the congregation’s journalists.
Health Secretary by letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system in relation to the fears associated with Bragzit
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers working in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and its desire to remain after Bregzit.
Jean Freeman, an MP in the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to cover the costs of decided applications for EU citizens' status working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued during the summer, with the aim of making the expected decisions this fall.
But the government of the United Kingdom also intensified preparations for the possibility of not reaching an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the working staff, regardless of his citizenship.
EU-wide colleagues and more widely share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, a defensive player at Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury to the match on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to "Vanderbilt Commodores", says Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury took place shortly before the half-time.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and he just stomped on the country," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, and then put it in and carried it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the "WSMV" in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Centar Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/level of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abekromby is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red dress at Tennessee State after the transfer from Illinois.
He took a total of five meetings Saturday before he left the game, resulting in a total of 18 meetings this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these extra funds will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralise Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Ministry expects this move to collect up to 120 million pounds a year, funds to be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be considered an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-income people.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and non-taxable companies in the United Kingdom, with additional funds stepping up the government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount that includes higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it could reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, leading to price increases and causing difficulties for those who buy property for the first time to be involved in this housing process.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was only published a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for the administrative fee to be reduced to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of offering high prices to properties that keep the land, but did not use it and asked Ms. May to change access home quotas in order to correct the "probable housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including house controls and ending evictions for no reason.
He also wants to give counsel to give more authority to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to the return of the British dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Still, it is not right for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to be able to buy homes in the same easy way as the valuable British residents.
The dream of owning a home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland" · Global Voices
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland said his "end ambition" is in the future to become the manager of the Scottish National Club.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeastern club currently ranked third in the first league with just three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to "The Stadium of Light" after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told Scotland's "Sportsound" to BBC.
"But I grew up constantly looking at Scotland in "Hampden" with my father and always pulling me back.
However, such an opportunity could only be obtained if I was successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as the manager of "Sunderland" are Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Head of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any anxiety knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club, after he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success is currently being assessed with "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy for this club to get there, but I'll probably think I've achieved success here only if I get the club back there."
Ross works as a manager for only three years, in which a career he entered after working as assistant to the head at Dumbarton and after 15 months of engagement as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped "Alloa" recover from his third league and returned "St. Mirren" from the end of the title loss in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was playing "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"It was probably a real crossroads for me," he recalled taking over "Alloa".
"I sincerely believed that a career manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making enough of it, and enjoying certain high powers.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good at acting as a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my whole adult life."
You can hear the full "Sportsound" interview on Sunday, September 30 at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST (British summer time)
According to one study, the perfect time for a beer is 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs currently in a very difficult situation, but has put pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July, but the profits of restaurants have decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA's business consulting services to determine these numbers said: "Sunshine time and longer than England's expected participation at the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when pub profits rose by 2.8 per cent and restaurants declined significantly.
The decline in sales of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June has worsened further during July.
The pubs and bars that mostly sell drinks have seen a much higher increase than in previous years than in restaurants where falling has been observed.
The pubs in which food is mostly sold were also badly affected by sunny periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and the sale of food by only three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for vacation and hospitality from RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is no surprise at all that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 percent over a year will be particularly striking as an addition to the current pressures generated by the costs.
The long warm summer could not come at a worse time for locals that mostly sell food and time will show if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide much needed rest."

One in five children has a secret social media profile that she hides from her parents.
One study found that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media profile that she hides from her parents and teachers.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
News Increases Fear of Such Profiles Declare Sexual Content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "head" profile that they show to their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates a social media profile that he hides from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a shortcut to the Instagram website where photographs are shared.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content has been published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "head" profile that they showed to their parents, while they had other private profiles.

A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half admitted that one of them was secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics board.
Elid Doyle was selected as the executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most distinguished athlete in Scotland and President Ian Byty has described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and global athletic communities has great respect for Elid, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the board," Byty said.
Doyle said, "I am ready to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help in the proper direction of sports in Scotland."
An American who won the titles at the Atlanta Games in 1996, despite the winning four gold medals at the Olympic Games and who now appears regularly as a commentator of the BBC, could not go after having suffered a long-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would tell me if I recovered or to what extent.
The whole process was arduous, but I was able to recover completely, I can go again and do agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouragement messages!"
An advertisement for a chest pump where mothers are likened to cows has led to a division of Internet opinion
A chest pumping company has created a division of the opinions of the Internet when it publishes advertising that breast mothers are likened to milking cows.
In order to mark the launch of the product that is said to be "the world's most important breast pump", the user-oriented technology company Elvie published a ridiculous advertising inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are breast-feeding.
Four mothers dance in a cow's barn full of hay whose lyrics sound like this: "Yes, I milk, but you don't see the tail," and "If you haven't noticed this, these are my breasts."
The phrase continues: "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, milk my breasts."
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it accentuates "the horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, except the fact that their children are stolen from them after only a few days after they have given birth," one of the comments said.
The Elvie Building is discreetly incorporated into the Breast-feeding Garden ("Elvie"/ "Mother").
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "A really inappropriate commercial."
Others defended advertising, and a woman admitted that the song was truly “smart. ”
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd buy a pump like this if I still had it.
I felt like a cow because of the latching.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a product of genius," one of the comments said.
Another commented: "This is a fun commercial intended for milk-milk mothers (often in their jobs or toilets) and they feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discreet pumps were shoved into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk-milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, there are no wires, no pipes, and discreetly fit in the breasts, allowing women to move, keep their babies, and even get out of the house while milking.
Anna Balarin, a partner and DDR in "Mother" commented: "Elvie's pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By setting parallels between women who milk milk and milk cows, we wanted milk to be milked with pump and the challenges it brings to the center of attention, showing the incredible sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has been present in all headlines.
During a fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Yakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has increased significantly even though crossings at the monthly level have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult for children to be accommodated by sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unidentified immigrants and were afraid of endangering their own stay in the country if they wanted to be a sponsor of a child.
Risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would need to make fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official last week testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of applicants for the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor family are illegally residing in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we keep chasing those individuals," said Mr. Albens.
In order to deal more quickly with children, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not within 60 days, as shelter workers say it was the previous standard.
Many will appear through a conference video call, not in person, in order to bring their case of legal status to the immigration judge.
Those considered to be unfit for relief will immediately be deported.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which could lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, workers in shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where its size makes it more likely that signs are neglected that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city, without having enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, could increase the traumas that most of them already face.
Syria tells US, French, and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem has urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces illegally resided in Syria's territory under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they would be treated appropriately."
"They must immediately withdraw without laying conditions," he told the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people lost their lives since 2011, and millions were displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to lead this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" of the two terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this country destroyed by war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions were good for them to return and accused "some of the Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise the question that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction assistance until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last major rebel stand in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed at the jihadists, including the Nusera Frontote fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who will "be eliminated".
UN envoy Stafan de Mistura hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee made up of government members and the opposition in order to draft a post-mortem constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Mualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "considering members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump Will Win Second Mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless his presidential mandate is suspended by impeachment and scandal, which is likely to be high hopes for a large proportion of liberalists.
What will no doubt be "The most dramatic finale in the presidency ever seen!"
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the impact rating has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nielsen says "Fox News" averages 2.4 million viewers in impact time, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on "MSNBC" reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in evenings when important news is being reported.
"This is like a fire to which people feel attracted because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main television producer of the "Designed Survivors" drama of "ABC" for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after Capitol has been destroyed by an attack.
Nell Skovel, veteran in the writing of comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He replied, "Because I think he is really funny," Mrs. Skovel told me.
There's a certain fun value in all this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe case versus Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Disengagement from all of this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have been looking at a panel of experts who are debating the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a skin bomber for Paul Manafort's $15,000 ("Blood dress," as he called "The Washington Post") and the implications of Mr. Trump's shocking descriptions of anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"Some of what he does and gives you a sense of how to watch a reality show is that every night he brings you something new," says Brant Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" for the rotational team of Trump's show and daily twists (punishes with NFL, praises to Kim Young-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode because then you won't be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Flays this week was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Cauai, but he was locked inside and watched "MSNBC" while recording on CNN.
He couldn't stop looking, at least not when Brett Kavano was supposed to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Foreign inflow to the toughest middle-aged race in the Upper House
It is not surprising that the 17th convention area in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganization of congress areas where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently renovated suburban area in Pittsburgh is run by Democratic representative Connor Lamb, who won a seat in another area in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th congressional district, which is largely intertwined with the new 17th congressional area.
The maps were changed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas were manipulated in favour of the Republicans, contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional area is a difficult competition to fund campaigns between the main sponsors of the parties, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaigns Committee ("DCCC") and the National Campaigns Committee of the Republican Party ("NRCC").
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the 18th congressional elections in Pennsylvania held in March, characterised by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won the area by a score of 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats little advantage.
US decides to punish El Salvador for supporting China, then quit
Diplomats stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognised Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a friendly meeting in June 2017 with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled Trump's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, State Department spokesman in a statement he made earlier this month.
But only in terms of El Salvador were penalties taken into account, which received US aid of about $140m in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and the high unemployment and killing rates in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar gathering last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials stressed that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively put an end to any reflection on El Salvador's punishment.
Deputy President Mike Pence should address a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance that the administration assigns to the assembly, diplomats say.
The three US officials also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of severe messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thinking on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by a foreign analyst who was close to the administration and who also talked about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that can happen is the release of Special Adviser Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which is currently very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller has reportedly also directed his investigation into the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign has been linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress's composition changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before the voters, and possibly before the jury composed of his colleagues.
There are a lot of uncertainties here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed to do so, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The flow of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot seat after this paper said that last year he proposed to secretly film the president and speculated that he was uncomfortable with the function he performed.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"How will we proceed if the new Brett Cavanaugh investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the middle of the year to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I do believe that this will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for Saturday on a table with a swastika logo.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of the Rangers with an optimistic stance in front of the Rapid Vienna conflict
The Rangers are hosting the Rapid Vienna conflict on Thursday, and they are aware of the fact that after a failed match against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month the victory over Austrians will solidify their position to qualify for the Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, the mid-order player for knee injury was prevented from appearing in the season until the unsolved 2-2 game with "Villarreal," but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as an offboard for bigger achievements.
"That was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and returned with a won point.
We may have been able to do a little more at the end, but the unsolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and were better.
Another big European night awaits us on Thursday.
I hope we win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of fans, we'll return and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year since everything that happened, my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor regarding the site.
The team's good and the boys really enjoy it; the training's good.
I hope we can go forward now, leave last season behind us and achieve success."
Women cannot sleep at night because of this fear associated with pension savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of the way they wanted to be cared for, few talked to family members about it.
About half of the students in the study conducted by Nationalwide said they had talked to their marriage mates about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they do not take steps to discuss the same," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Company "Nationwide".
Here's where you start.
Discuss with your mate and your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how care can be given because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your election to finance long-term care can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy of cash, which can help you cover costs or provide yourself with self-sustainment insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Manage your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the very beginning.
Take out the health care responsibilities so that you can empower a person of trust to supervise your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider, too, the privilege of your finances.
In this way they would choose a person of trust to make financial decisions in your name and to pay your bills if you were not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs immediate medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and his allergies?
Note these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asks.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan like this."

His injuries were not life-threatening, and the police appealed to the witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials announced, with the number of victims expected to increase.
Because of the interruption of communications, aid workers are unable to obtain information from the Dongala district, north of Palu, which is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated.
In addition, several key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Dongala is a district stretching more than 300km (180 miles) on the coast of the northwestern part of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's economy, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovov, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Indonesia's disaster relief agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit and west Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific ring of fire and regularly strikes earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226.000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of them were residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra by the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that destroyed the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentaway, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focus earthquake hit Paddy Jaya County in Aceh, causing devastation and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the earthquake caused no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Big earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for family violence charges
Trek Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice president's candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of family violence, interference in a report on family violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the Mat-Su detention facility, with the possibility of leaving if he pays an amount of $500, said "KTU".
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when he was asked how he pleaded before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A-class violations, which means he can be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a B-class violation, fined with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before Alaska's Veteran Court is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with a domestic attack, interfering with a report on a crime of family violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her on the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by the veteran groups in 2016 after saying that her son's violent behaviour stemmed from PTSD, the result of his service in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit an area near Central Sulavesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
Social media is running videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the Palu beach festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of New York Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Syfulo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, in October, allegedly used a rental truck on Home Depot to attack a bicycle path on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan and run over the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a report on the intention to seek a death sentence delivered to the South District of New York.
According to the court's documents, there is an opportunity to impose a death sentence on both of these grounds under the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal grand jury filed charges against Saipov on 22 bases, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of racketeering, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
In order to carry out the attack, it was necessary "deal planning and intent," prosecutors said, in which the way that Saipov carried out it described it as "grossful, cruel and crooked."
"Sifulo Habib Saipov caused, injuries, damage and loss of family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lore Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the state said in a report on the state's intentions.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since a death row in the South District of New York.
The defendant, Kalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal case was executed in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death with an electric capital on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
Police said he told the investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent on all 22 grounds.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea for guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of release will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved," Paton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Turkish lawmaker says NAJJEL FARAJ should be in charge of the Briggsit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilise the People's Army" during a protest at the Turkish Party's conference.
The former party leader Ucip said politicians must "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, with one of Teresa May's deputies suggesting that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
A conservative supporter, Peter Bon, of the Birmingham march said that the United Kingdom would have been "out of the EU" if Mr. Farage had been the secretary of the Bregzit.
But the challenge facing Ms. May regarding the integration of its deeply divided members was highlighted by the counter-Bregzit members of the "Tori" party who joined in a special protest against Braggzit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Chekers plan despite pro-Bregzit attacks by individuals, counter-Bregzit individuals and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would force the Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bone told the pro-Bregzit meeting "Leave Means Leave" in Salihal that he wanted "the plan has been rejected by the Checkers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge of the negotiations, we would have been outside the EU by now," he said.
The Velingborough MP added: "I will support Braggsit, but we must reject the Checkers plan."
Voicing his stance against the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars so that we would now be subordinated.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely inaccurate."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Party "Tori" and pro-Bregzit, also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chekers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually going out on the streets and who owe our victory in the elections.
Please give up the Chekers plan and listen to us."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs while they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Bregzit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Bragzit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has enabled us to win in Bragzit and which will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bregzit marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour gathering in the city centre.
After the group's gathering, a small number of activists appeared this weekend who wore banners with the headline "Torivs v. Bregzit".
Lord Adonis, a Labour Party member mocked conservatives on security issues facing the opening of a conference on the party's application.
"These are people who tell us they can establish IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for a border without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Bregzit," he added.
Warren plans to think twice about running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think well about running for president" after the November vote.
Boston Globe said the Democratic Party of Massachusetts representative spoke about his future during the town hall in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run in the November re-elections against Republican Party official Jeff Dil, who was co-chairman of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holiok was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump came to the presidency, whose maintenance uses a city hall format.
One of the audience asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, which includes putting a woman on top."
Suspect arrested on the shooting and death of basketball Simms on the LSU team.
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Simms from the "LSU" team that happened on Friday was arrested.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the arrest of Diton Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 o'clock Eastern Time.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help to identify the man from the recording.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms had a gunshot wound to his head and as a result of the same death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, "247 sports".
Wade got involved in defending his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, possessing weapons, and shooting at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
As a junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Simms played 32 games with 10 performances last season, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 caught balls after the game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders secured his victory over Sebastian Vetel
Since Saturday, Walter Botas qualified for Louis Hamilton, it has become clear that the orders of the Mercedes team will play a major role in the race.
From the half-point Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on a CD while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel entered boxing first and let Hamilton fight the riot at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing one circle later and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of one who forced Ferrari's driver reluctantly to leave the inside of his free risk to stay aside after a double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstapen began from the back row of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
He then led most of the race and directed the tires of his car to the finish line and to reach Kimi Raiconen, taking the fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxing of the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raiconen came to fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me through.
The team has made a really exceptional decision to have a couple in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad talk on the body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feynstein at a rally Saturday regarding her insistence that she did not publish Christine Blasi Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "wicked and rude and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and careless and honest," he said.
"When you see reports and leaks of information and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you publish this information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish it... no, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Feynstein regarding the charges against Kavano by Ford in July, and they were published in early September, but Feynstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish her story," Feynstein told the committee, "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep them confidential, and I did what she asked."
But the president does not seem to believe her denial, and he commented on the same thing at the rally on Saturday: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad talk on the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use instructions to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You can see their wickedness, their meanness, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they need to pin on to regain their power and control," the president said, as Mediaite declares.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for "Giants" in the match against "Dundee"
Dundee Stars paid for the loss of the Elite League match on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 match in Dundy on Saturday.
Giants received the advantage of two goals achieved by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney got a head start on the host before Dwyer could reinstate the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bushar aligned for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the season of the Elite League for Adam Cefi's boys, who returned their victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, 3:35 with Kendall McFol's addition, which was secured by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan provided the host's leadership at 13:10 p.m., before Matt Mercart assisted Kauni to achieve the 15:16 p.m. result.
Dwyer took care of Giants to take the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them with a powerful game and goal, with the result being 27:37.
Cawney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen first secure Dundee's leadership in the second period late and he secured his team's victory for half of the final period of the fifth match.
Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next game on Friday on the domestic field in Milton Kanes.
Flying controller died helping hundreds of people on the plane get out of the earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous for being a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong consistent earthquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are stuck in ruins in the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues fled to save their own life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower at Mutira Sis Al Jufrie Airport in Palu, which was constantly moving.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's flight number 6321, which was on the runway at that time, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was crashing.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that her decision likely saved hundreds of lives, said Australian "ABC News".
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Siggy and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under rubble, while many cannot even approach," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho's spokesman.
Waves that reached up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told of "Sky News": "The ambulance carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said of the “CNN”:“The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Yoko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and ordered the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that a man disappeared after he had previously said that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said Saturday afternoon they could not find the male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane hit the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some Witnesses felt that the plane had missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others were able to cross the water that reached half of them and head for emergency exits on a sinking plane.
He said the stewardess were panicking and shouting, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the port reconstruction also helped rescue by taking people to the shore before sinking in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water by means of an inflatable ship.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents on aircraft registered in the NG in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini.
Analyst established a time frame of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended up presenting the case Saturday for the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rovelt, an analyst at the U.S. Justice Department, witnessed for hours as a witch in the field of intelligence analysis.
He pointed out to the jury that he used phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rovelt said he received data on the location of several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contrary to his previous statements, said "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went to talk to Sandford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they only knew each other for a week.
Rovelt said some time after Chambers's death, Tellis deleted his messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her phone contact information.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defence should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is a conscientious hip-hop?
Hip-hop Trio wants to defeat the negative attitude towards this genre by including positive messages in his music.
"The High Breed" of Bristol claims that the hip-hop has distanced itself from its origins as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists like "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lovekey".
Another black?!
A New York donor sues a married couple because she was fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York widow sues a married couple because she was dismissed on the basis of discrimination after she mistakenly received a message from a mother who complained about the fact that she was "another black woman."
The couple deny that they are racist, saying that the lawsuit is actually "extortion."
Lynci Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new nanny Giselle Morris found out she was a black woman.
"She's not here yet, one black woman," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Fluxman in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing what she actually did to Flat-Faxman, feeling "inconvenient" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, was doing a bad job and that she was expecting the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, said New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first work day and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the married couple and demanding compensation for damages for a $350-a-day bailout in a period of six months, an engagement that would involve her living with the family, what she was initially engaged in, but without a deal.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she said on Friday, adding, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple responded to complaints that they were racist, saying that Mrs. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable act because they feared that they could no longer believe her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasko said of the "Post".
"But would you entrust your children to the person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Saying that the lawsuit is "extortion", Plasco said that his wife bore the baby just two months ago and that she was in "a very difficult situation."
"Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public immediately condemned the social media couple, criticizing them for their conduct and logic.
Paddington publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect to a talking bear, found in the new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It is really difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about Paddington's huge success.
After he said that her father who worked as a cameraman for "BBC" before he was inspired to write a book from a little toy in the shape of a bear, would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and didn't want to brag at all," she said.
"But because you felt "Paddington" so real, it was almost like you had a child who had achieved something in life: and you were proud of him even though success didn't owe you yourself.
I think Paddington's success was perceived in that way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited them to Paddington himself."
My daughter was on her deathbed, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
On landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital “Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that it will not survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slow and they came out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
All I had to do was sit back and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I could not scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay safe."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz mourning for his daughter's loss got on the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation he was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head, and tears did not stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt great sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Sad women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as a contagious smile.
"Everyone remembered him after his smile.
People always said his smile could light up any room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place."
His brother who was then 11 was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I constantly fear that this will have a consistent effect."
Ms. Davis makes the cards “to make it clear to others that there are people out there that they can turn around and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quietly, you need to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost her partner, Mark, to whom she was married 15 years after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or said anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the day of Christmas when the children opened their gifts, and he looked them in the eye and made no contact with them."
She said that his death is a major trauma to all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “That’s something that upsets the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we must continue to fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain since the FBI launched the investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembles what he was looking for, a limited-time investigation, with limited scope, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee "deployed" under the conditions of the ingrained guerrilla state.
Why did Kavano and his Republican party supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their volatility is solely due to the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, 6 November, and if Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, meanwhile, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate's vote, allowing Vice President Mike Penz to change the unsolved result and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "decreased" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, an MP from South Korea said.
Park Beeong-seug, quoting data from South Korea's unification ministry that last year there were 1,127 border crossings compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said the more expensive border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang did not make a public comment.
Most of the refugees from North Korea are currently receiving citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and which can be easier to cross than the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China sees these people as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still technically at war, has improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on stagnation of denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal -- the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho charged Saturday with sanctions imposed by the United States for stagnating progress from then to now.
"If he doesn't trust the United States; he won't trust our national security, and under such conditions we can't unilaterally first disarm ourselves," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavano "hysterical" and said that given his temper, he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the "Texas Tribune Festival" festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman did so, they would say it was "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavano's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasi Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavanaugh was very emotional in his introduction, sometimes even shouting and snooping as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "the grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016's presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Cavanaugh's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it turned out that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavano from office if allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he is not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to serve in the court where he is currently in office," Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about the possible rulings that Kavano would bring against the Law on Access to Health Care or Roe versus Wade, as it is believed to be the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, "this is really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's a really harsh criticism, months and years of raring anger that she can't free him from himself without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued, “A woman who performed an executive function somewhere, and who told me that she was crying when she was angry but was able to develop her own technique, so when she became angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to,“ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continues to cry.
I think it's genius."
Tears are allowed as a blow vent for anger partly because they are actually misinterpreted.
One of my brightest memories of one of my first jobs in an office where men dominated is when I once started crying with unspeakable anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager from whom I always had a certain fear, grabbed my neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will enjoy the fact that they've managed to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder was in that period a democratic congresswoman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-mart affair with the name "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for president.
"That was not a well-considered decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow and the Seven Dwarves."
Given the fact that the campaign had long been launched, it did not have enough funding, so it promised not to enter the race if it did not raise $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I should have a discount?" she wondered.
During a speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign she was so overpowered by emotion, or gratitude to the people who supported her, frustrated by the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger at sexism, she began to cry.
"If you saw me you would probably think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to the incident.
"You'd think Klinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my tombstone.
"She's crying?"
Like the U.S.-China trade war can be a good thing for Beijing
Opening fire with the start of the United States-China trade war was deafening, and although the battle is far from over, the conflict between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning this year at the beginning of this year by assigning key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The situation significantly escalated during this week by introducing new $200 billion-dollar tariffs on goods, effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing returned in kind each time, a recent imposition of tariffs of between five and ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return to the United States equally, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will soon give up.
Trying to get Washington to back down means accepting his demands, but public worship before the United States would be too embarrassing for Xie Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing does well, pressure from the trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China in the long term as the interdependence of the two economies will be reduced.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the start of a sudden decline in economic aspect in any of the countries is much more dangerous than was previously identified by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, which is a thin tank.
Syria "prepared" for refugee returns, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and makes efforts to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by the long war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, owing to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas ravaged by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally imposed economic measures affecting their daily lives are now being met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomed help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe achieves a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe beat the US team in the 2018 Raider Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in order on European territory and has not won the title of Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its primate after the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points that were needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Michelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, threw his first punch out of a hole in the water in a steam-3 on the 16th hole, losing his French Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari stressed in all rounds, becoming one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 after the tournament began organizing in the current format in 1979.
USman Jordan Spit lost 5-4 of the lowest ranking player on the European team, Torbjorn Olezen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top ranking player lost 2 and 1 to Ian Potter from England, who may have played the Ryder Cup last time.
Spanish veteran Sergio García, a participant in eight Raider Cups, became the European who won the most titles in the winning 25.5 points during his career.
"I don't normally cry, but I can't stop today.
It's been a really tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy to be able to help," emotional Garcia said after winning Europe.
He is now deposing his compatriot John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, the US golf legend on Sunday, 2-1.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to direct the game to low-grass pitches, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik after his team's disappointing game said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point in the morning, we gave the team a lot of trouble from Europe.
We fought.
Capt down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Association of Professional Golfers of America and our committee for the Ryder Cup, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit to them.
We're outnumbered.
