In China and the area, two men killed themselves.
Previously, one of the hangings had attempted suicide.
On 30 October, around 1-00, in Lugovo village, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had attempted suicide before.
Which led a man to such a step is unknown.
On 31 October, in 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a Chinese resident, died at his place of residence.
No signs of violent death have been found, reports MoM Press Service Qinezemsky.
Do you have a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair the crumbling road system, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box neatly mounted on your vehicle's instrument panel.
These devices, which track and transmit to officials every passing mile, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize America's old-fashioned highway finance system, undertaken by the planning authorities of Washington and the state.
The usual boring arena of highway planning has suddenly sparked intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow the Government to use small boxes to track the amount of miles you pass, and even perhaps where you pass them, and then to use this information to compile tax accounts.
The flute movement in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues concerning private life.
Although the congress cannot yet agree on whether to proceed or not, several states are not expected to wait.
They reflect on how the next decade can be moved to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have satellite tracking functions.
This is really necessary for our country.
“It is not the question on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihrat, executive director of the Association of Government of Southern California, who is preparing plans to start tracking by the state authorities the miles passing by each California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's technology for that.
The need for this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Government Road Construction Fund, financed by taxes paid by Americans on auto-fuelling.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to tax even one cent at high prices for gasoline.
“The tax on gasoline cannot be maintained”, said Lee Mannich, an expert in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed to test the wrong payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term”, he said.
The boredoms call it a misplaced user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, since taxes will change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California ' s planning bodies are looking into this system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state ' s ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives of Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transport Committee of the Chamber, said that he also viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Réason Free Marketers are also excited about making drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that goes into the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Political Affairs, Reasonon.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement was also supported by two former US Transport Ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards a wrong payment.
The U.S. Senate approved last year a $90 million pilot project involving some 10,000 vehicles.
The leaders of the House of Representatives, however, rejected this proposal because of the concerns of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel many miles in daily life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The most enthusiastic is in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of running instead of a gas tax.
The pilot project has already been completed in Nevada.
It's under review in New York.
Illinos will try it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
A coalition of I-95, which includes 17 East Coast States transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), explores how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could monitor their every move.
“The concern about the “big brother” and such things is a major problem”, said Alauddin Khan, who is responsible for strategy and performance management in the Nevada State Department of Transport.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were complete, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be almost easy to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, massive technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the day-to-day movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where poor technology is difficult to find, which would allow the state authorities to keep track of miles, but without information on the location and time.
If you can do it, said Han, society will feel more comfortable.
This technology has led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not involved in the State tax collection.
It sought to enter the developing market of the type of road insurance in which drivers paid on the basis of the running.
But the devices it tests involve road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically loaded with modems.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you do not track their speed or track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There were several major errors in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are far less expensive and less demanding ways to do this.
In Oregon, projectors are experimenting with different options for drivers.
They can select a device with or without a GPS.
Or they could completely abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all the residents of the state travel through.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a careful public, forcing devices to do more than that.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax facility that will also accept parking meter fees, provide “travel” insurance and collect real-time data pools from other drivers who could be used by motorists to avoid traffic.
“Vehicle drivers will be involved in the benefits they will offer”, says the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, are wondering whether all misrepresentations of payment are simply a huge distraction.
In the Gulf of San Francisco City Transport Commission, officials say that the congress could very simply overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for Road Construction by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid drivers and other persons whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is accept aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private lives and many other things.
EU prepares support measures for Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan for Ukraine by gas, as well as to agree with IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a standby loan and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their purpose is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and IMF can overcome long-standing differences in funding conditions.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to obtain assistance and the international rating agency S&P, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step on Friday to “B” on “B”.
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the EU country's financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to provide Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now coming from Russia.
Maybe it'll be the gas from the North Stream or the reverses from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia “insulates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and is likely to reduce supply to other regions.
“There are negotiations between EU and Ukrainian countries on how to create an enabling environment so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but from other routes”, Reuters added.
Russia outside the urban pollution control of automobiles
Efforts to address the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most megapolises of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
They were usually either re-engineered and expanded roads, or attempts to reduce demand for, and use of cars.
Singapore ' s example is well known, where a sharp quota has been introduced for the increase in the number of private cars and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price may double the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, entered the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only vehicles with a certain ecoclass are permitted to enter, also using high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environment Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year clean air plan” with a total value of around 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As the Director of the Transport Control Division of the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, Beijing Li Kunscheng, said, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (currently 5.2 million) and increase by not more than 5 per cent in fuel consumption per vehicle.
According to the agency, road transport in Beijing is responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme are the limitation of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes on owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the Green Five-year-old include an accelerated transition from the rest of the country to European fuel standards, the introduction of a local ecosystem system and the marking of cars and fuels, the restriction on the entry of vehicles into the central part of the city, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (but also the establishment of incentive schemes to replace old cars for hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service vehicles), the development of public transport (including high-speed transport).
The road innovations of Beijing also include a ban on all private vehicles to move within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the PRC) one day per week (the corresponding information is contained in the vehicle registration plate) and the issuance of lottery registration plates (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the 2010 number).
According to the existing Environmental Protection 2012-2020 programme, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to Mindura, in 2011, 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants into the urban atmosphere accounted for “moving sources”.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times more than industrial and in St. Petersburg, nine times.
In the RF, it is only time to think about the possibility of restricting the regulation of cars in urban streets.
The Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel can only be taken by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of poorly responsive to any regulatory effects - commercial and personal cars, as well as vehicles of “privileged” users, totalling at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of Moscow’s total fleet).
In the days of the urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg, a study was prepared to analyse the balance of urban areas between housing, road surface area and the amount of road transport.
The main findings of the researchers are that the city’s center is twice as much as the required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them in parking or just on the streets for a long time.
As a result, it is proposed to build, not parking, but car storage facilities, rather than expand, but reduce the carriageway (in order to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the borders of the protected area of the historic centre (a common territory of some 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vlogde will increase on an average
According to the urban authorities, the increase in fines would help to bring order in Volad and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they carry out often do not pass the adequate sanitary control.
This means that the health of the wetlands is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade will increase from six times from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles in November, reports the Voloda Administration Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the chief driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer credits and massive cuts in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of this growth.
It has recently been fully driven by consumption that almost slows down the turnover," said chief economist Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Graf, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
The nominal wage growth in Russia is now around 10%.
With inflation of 6 per cent, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at around the current level, expected at Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is declining, so they are likely to be optimizing staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages rise by 10 per cent, GDP by only 2 per cent, explained Mr. Graffa.
Companies have experienced a decrease in profitability.
If it does not grow up, this may lead to dismissals and increased unemployment.
Not to raise wages, the Russian business cannot, comments chief economist Barclays Capital on Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantušin.
Unemployment close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise wages in order to lure or retain employees.
Russia's consumption of support is also a very rapid increase in the need for credit.
According to Mr. Graf, due to the very high rates of consumer borrowing, this type of credit does not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
“The benefits for the economy from increasing the demand for credit are not seen, the money is not divided by the economy, but is returned to the same banks as interest payments”, said the economist.
But the problem is another - Goldman Sachs expects an increase in the delay on unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by the poor, who have nothing to provide for their security.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are often not returned," said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible non-payment crisis on unsecured loans.
The Director of the Ushe Banking Institute, Vasili Sodkov, is already seeing signs of a emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, while not having access to cheap resources, such as the gosbanks, were forced to attract the population to high interest rates.
In response, the Gosbans went to the bottom of the war and began to lower their rates of credit - the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot lend the same interest, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the canisters do not give up dumping, Russia is facing a full banking crisis, according to Vasily Soodkov.
The loss of licenses of several banks in recent weeks is considered by the economist to be a harbinger of mass collapse.
“Hosbanks themselves will fail to cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system has not originally been designed for a systemic crisis”, warns the head of the institution.
But the increase in consumption will slow down without a non-payment crisis, they believe in an investment bank because of the failure to index the salaries of the public and military personnel in the current version of the draft budget.
In part, the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopolies tariffs (and, as a result, the decline in inflation).
But only in part: if the investment does not grow (and the assumptions do not yet exist - see the reference), consumption growth will still slow down, confident in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantušin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the prerequisites for the realization of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is the continuing fall in oil prices," he said.
He estimated that Russia's economy would start to decrease at less than $90/barr oil prices.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB has not yet been able to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has declined, and banks have begun to raise interest rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that announced the transition to inflation targeting," said Clemens Graffa.
The Central Bank's interest rate policy does not affect market rates; it only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the CB, it's a collapse of all hope," said Clemens Graffe.
Banks use money at auctions, not to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
Once the rate decreases, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
“It is early or late that the CB will understand that the strategy is not working”, said Mr. Grafe, and recalled that it is planned that the State should put the ruble in “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But either you have to do it sooner or you have to raise the key CB rate (5.5 per cent), he thinks.
According to him, the roubling rate is now artificially overstated by 10 per cent.
There's only one way to go, weak, the expert's finding.
But if the CB in the financiers had any doubts that eliminating the currency corridor was not part of a policy to reduce the rubble, it could destroy the ruble much more strongly.
A second meeting of the peoples of the South Urala took place in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum is connected with People ' s Unity Day, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The meeting was attended by delegations from all cities and areas of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious faiths, legislative and executive bodies - a total of about 350 persons.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening inter-national agreement.
We can show an example here not only to other regions but also to other countries.
We don't have any differences or disagreements.
We live in complete understanding," said Feofan, Mitropiti Chelabinsky and Zlatoustovsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
Following the meeting, the resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations in Chelabin Region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “co-operate” with Germany on the matter of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, U.S. Intelligence., stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Streebele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, a member of the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “In spite of the positive outcome of my efforts, my Government continues to think differently as a miscarriage and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that do not provide any protection.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The U.S. Department of Justice charges include espionage and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, informed Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do so.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that the NSA had been listening to Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy head of a parliamentary intelligence group, said that if there was an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States completely”, it should be used.
Mr. Streebele, a member of Parliament from a party of green Germany, published his photo with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Streebele said that according to the lawyer of the former ANB contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “in security”, said the MP.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the world's response to “his political remarks”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high - ranking officials — including in the United States — felt that uncontrollable surveillance systems were useful to society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities, “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge a hand toll
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers for carrying a hand lay aboard their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a hand deposit and $2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers could keep the entire bank.
The new handbag fee applies to bags in the upper baggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said he would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers paid only when they left for landing.
Frontier's representative Kate O'Malley said the $100 bill should make the passengers take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to pay for it,” she said.
The airlines began charging for the first and second bags in luggage in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid these charges are putting as much as they can into a hand deposit in the upper baggage compartments, which often means that there is no room in these sections.
Meetings are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said that this new collection isn't really about making money.
The point is that Frontier's most loyal customers claim to find a place in the upper baggage compartments is becoming more difficult.
Passengers who buy airline tickets won't have to pay.
This means that one passenger in turn may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in procedures on the website and the flow of Frontier registration is intended to ensure that passengers know about the call before they get to take off.
Frontier's new collection for the hand lay will not begin to be charged until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of the luggage costs money, and the passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of flights after several years of loss.
However, most of them did not relate to hand-held fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first handhold fee three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air followed her example later.
The only other airline with such a collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said Air Consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
According to his December 2011 report, the collection of hand-held deposits is worth $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he was interested to find out that he was going to land when passengers faced with an unusual Spirit collection by hand.
"The landing process was the smoothest of what I saw for my career in airlines," he said.
I expected to see the teeth folded and the start of a landing fight.
The plane was taken captive, he said, “and the landing was fast. ”
Frontier also follows Spirit with respect to $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received gas or juice could keep the entire bank and that the share of coffee would be provided free of charge.
It will continue to distribute water free of charge.
The US Airways had been trying to charge a drink for a short time in 2008, but had given up seven months after passengers began complaining and no other major airline had followed her example.
Frontier's manual charges initiative, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last measure to get customers on its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than to resort to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went beyond that.
In September, it began to give twice as many bonus miles as the frequent passenger to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut a premium number of miles to 25 per cent of the mile journey.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would provide 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only be selected in advance if they buy tickets directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a foundation of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming wasteful.
Profits fell by 9 per cent, and summer opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to a financial outcome published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to improve Frontier's finances as part of the airline sales.
The NSA blames “internal error” rather than hackers for termination of the site
The Secret Security Agency stated on Friday evening that the termination of their website for a few hours caused a technical breakdown, not hackers, as reported on the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update,” the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the shift was caused by the “refoulement in service” attack [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems reported that the ANS site had not been operational for at least six hours, and the site was still not accessible to some users.
ABC News had previously reported that the agency ' s internal secret network “not” had been hacked.
No classified information was in danger, the representative said.
At least one online group of hackers-activists claimed that it was responsible for withdrawing from the ANB site by means of DDoS attacks.
DDoS attacks are designed to trap the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is out of line.
Hackers' tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The previously supersecret NSA, once named Net Such Agency, has been the focus of public attention and intense criticism in recent months following a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and within the country, all of this has been a response to classified NSA files stolen from the agency and published by disappointed former ANB officer Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked the fact that today's incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier's profits are falling as supplies and orders are being ordered by aircraft
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported on Thursday a 15 per cent reduction in net profits due to reduced orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
The Bombardier company in Montreal also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its new CSeries and did not provide new information on whether ambitious plans would be implemented to put the aircraft into commercial operation by the next September.
After the first flight of the pilot model of an aircraft about one and a half months ago, it flew only three more times, which raised questions as to whether the test stage was on schedule.
The results failed to meet the forecasts and led to more than 8 per cent decline in shares on the Toronto Foundation Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his estimate Thursday from "higher market" to "mederno" because of the belief that the growth of shares is limited in the nearest quarter or two.
“Although the decline in the quantity of aircraft supplies was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the moderation of the transport division’s profits,” said Doerxen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the summer test programme continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will be more skeptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow her to win a seat at the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominant.
The first test sample of the aircraft was submitted in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders to CSeries are not yet too many — 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the summer tests to verify the company's fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
Pierre Bodwan, Chief Executive, was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, leaders also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
“The test model of the plane has not remained on the ground for longer than expected”, Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software upgrades were planned during the simple flight.
All manufacturers plan different tests.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will take place throughout the summer test programme.
The second of the five test samples must be taken in the coming weeks and all the others will be following him shortly, as the company has reported.
However, analysts sceptically refer to the claim that the first client would be able to start operating CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it assessed the time frame for entry into service and would provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow pace of summer tests, although apparently consistent with the Bombardier internal schedule, reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerxen said.
In the third quarter, ending on 30 September, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, with $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted profit for the share remained at 9 cents.
Gross revenue decreased slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected the profit of 10 cents on share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
A fourth aircraft manufacturer reported that he had placed 45 aircraft per quarter, which was lower than the previous year ' s figure of 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of the Air Space Division's orders was $32.9 billion as at 30 September, without changing since 31 December.
“In the field of aviation, the results have been consistent with our objectives, but the small number of orders received and the general market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
Gross income in the aviation field fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that gross income in the sector had increased by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit was $32.6 billion as at 30 September, slightly higher than the figure on 31 December.
The revenues of the transport unit have been adversely affected by the performance of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier shares, which also announced that Google's principal financial director Patrick Pichett would join the board of directors, had fallen by 8.5 per cent to C$4,83 in mid-Thursday trade.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest Bombardier competitor, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual profits
Japan's electronics producer, Sony Corporation, finished the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, to reduce the current financial year's return forecast.
Sony's results from July to September 2013 have been more disappointing than expected, owing to the decline in demand for televisions, video cameras and Japanese private computers.
Sony TV, the first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in the first three years of the second quarter, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
Japan's consumer electronics market is going through tough times, especially as the demand for television declines.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently placed emphasis on industrial kits: sales are growing at a high rate, especially from road systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profits against the previous 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that the figure would be significantly higher and amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the food line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart hours from the Japanese corporation was announced, given a number of fashionable functions, which would eliminate the need to get a smartphone out of karmana 100 times a day.
After Sony reduced its annual income and income forecast, the company’s shares in Tokyo lost more than 11 per cent in the morning at the opening of the tortoises, dropping to 1668 yen per share.
The Gen of Speech has been a catalyst for synapses education.
Scientists at the University of John Hopkins and Mount Sinai Medical School discovered a protein that stimulates the development of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and a summary of its contents can be found on the magazine’s website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 because of the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak correctly and at times did not even understand each other.
Scientists have found that the work of Mr. Foxp2 has been disrupted by family members, but how he performs his function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their Foxp2 function is a catalyst for the formation of new synapses in the brain related to speech formation.
It's doing this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by authors, with Foxp2 being the only source of activity.
The fact that SRPX2 actually influences the volatility, scientists have confirmed in the experiment on mice.
When animals had artificially reduced activity, they screamed less when they separated from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sounds produced was restored.
Previously, mouse links were also shown to the Vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals who were introduced by a human gene were eating more actively and at a lower frequency than regular mice.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and its controlled SRPX2, respectively, are related to purely “mechanical” sound or more subtle processes.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation in prison
42-year-old Basharat Ditt transmitted information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarboro
Lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction to prison for three years.
Basharat Ditt, 42, provided criminal authority to Neil Scarborough with classified information on the investigation into his illicit drug activities after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
Lawyer, who received the nickname Bash and who had been called a “cool lawyer”, was arrested at his home in 2011 after the Scarboro police investigation operation, which he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
The officers observed that 32-year-old Scarborough had left three packets of cocaine at a lawyer's house in the city of Blackburn County of Lancashire while he was at dinner with a bar association with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta “regularly used” a class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he tried unlawfully to obtain information on the arrests of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were currently under police supervision as part of an extensive investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambodia, Mercisade, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police took out heroin and cocaine raids of £1.5 million and over £200 thousand in cash.
Ditt, 42, was passing the information to the criminals because he was afraid his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditt, who works forbes Solicitors, a law firm in Blackburn, was disgraced after confessing his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted to storing cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer's disclosure took place after Scarboro police officers found out that he had been talking to Ditta regularly on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and discovered how he went to Ditta's house in Blackburn and put drugs of 60 percent purity in a black glove for a golfer under a lawyer's trash box.
Shortly after Scarborough was transferred, he reconvened with Ditta, who was at a football stadium in Iwood Park, the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs, and there were nine conversations between them.
The court found that Ditta had “habited” cocaine on a regular basis after tests found traces of class A drug in his hair, in his wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, but denied the use of cocaine, said he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “advocate secret”.
While Ditt was in custody, he took his wallet and tried to remove some credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
At a police interrogation, he said that, along with the workplace, he had a home office, and his clients came to his house in legal cases.
However, it became clear to the court that, following important arrests, he had called the largest drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented in court to tell them that detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, Ann White said: "If anyone knows that they should not violate the law, it is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would no doubt prove lawful because he was their lawyer.
However, this has greatly crossed the boundaries of the usual relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He prevented the police from investigating as much as possible in order to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not read his profession, but disgraced her.
He had drawn too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and had given rise to doubts about his lack of interest.
Ditta did not plead guilty to saying: “If I were a corrupt lawyer to whom I am not, and would like to convey information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police stated: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he began to buy drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to criminal gangs, which entrusted him with valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and give society confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to conceal his profession.
Mr. Ditte ' s investigation led the Lancashire task force on particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage, and now to obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve fair punishment for criminals.
Let the case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarboro himself was convicted 14 years after confessing his guilt in conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 persons involved in the machination have been sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Dieta organized a question-and-answer discussion, in which he says that his dream is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the perfect companion for him for dinner — Mohammed Ali, and motivation for work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavla was not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, noted police officers attending the meeting of the RCF CDC today.
In their view, the programme was overstated about twice.
During the 1/16 match, Russia's Kubka final with Spartacom was used only a thousand stewards at a regulatory rate of 9,000.
Spartakov fans were given 2,200 seats, that is, 10 per cent of the stadium capacity, but, as agreed with the Moscow Club, 5,000 tickets were sold to them.
This data was released by the head of the CDC, Arthur Grigoryantz.
Americans listened to Japanese high officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the representatives of the U.S. Special Forces, who chose not to disclose his name, stated that the United States had been listening to the telephone conversations of senior officials in Japan.
This person confirmed that there are several points in the sun that are meant to be heard in the country.
He noted, however, that the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not carry out intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, has reported the NHK television channel, despite its post-war alliance with Americans.
Officially, none of the parties has yet commented on this information.
Let's remind you, news of the U.S. Special Services behind the chancellor of the FWG came up last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have been listening to Merkel's phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor himself, according to some data, took the report of her audition very painfully.
She stated that the allies, who she believed were the FWG and the United States for decades, were not acceptable for such an observation of the head of Government.
However, Edward Snowden stated that he was prepared to share details of Angela Merkel's telephone interview with the German prosecutor's office.
The Germans specifically flew to Moscow to meet a former CIA officer.
Basquiry may place grain on the market not earlier than early 2014
In the course of the public procurement interventions, Bascarija may place grain on the market not earlier than the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister for Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to the intervention fund.
While the market is higher, there's demand.
“Perhaps the grain will be traded after the New Year”, he stated at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that this year, crop crops for 2013 amounted to 3.1 million ha, including crops of 1.7 million ha, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
Under the harvest of 2014, 550,000 ha (105,000 ha more than in 2012) were planted.
The areas under the winter wheat and triticales were covered, and the flowers remained at the old level.
There is no "Bratsky Circle" in the IMF bases, to which Leps was assigned in the United States
In Russian syllage databases, the Bratsky Circle group, to which Washington has been assigned by the singer Gregory Leps, does not exist.
According to Interfax in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after media reports of the introduction by the U.S. Ministry of Finance of Gregory Leps into the control lists on suspicion of membership of the Euro-Asian criminal syndicate “Bratsky Circle”, all databases have been verified, but no such group has been detected.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian mob”, which is allegedly operating abroad, is believed to be in power structures.
"Even in the name itself - 'Brother Circle', there's some element of mystery, there's a hint of a secret lie.
"It's all very like a pear-action," said the interlocutor of the agency.
On 31 October, the U.S. Ministry of Finance announced the listing of its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurovision criminal syndicate “Bratsky Circle” by Arthur Badalana, Grigoria Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalina, Sergey Moskalenko, Jakov Rybalski and Igorya Schlykov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of being associated with someone named Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be influential members of criminal groups and have been on United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps “is a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev”.
In the production centre of Gregory Lepsa, they refused to comment on the U.S. charges against the singer, calling them "bread".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama took the Bratsky Circle syndicate as “the main transnational organized criminal groups” and assigned the mine to “keep and prevent their global criminal operations”.
The blacklisting of the American Minfine entails freezing his assets in the United States and prohibiting the business of persons living in the United States.
Scandal video hit the police.
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless excuses, fell on crack smoking.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had a video recording and were prepared to launch an investigation against the mayor.
He stated that he would not leave his post, reported CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use appeared on the Toronto Police website.
Bill Blair, head of local law enforcement agencies, held a press conference on this matter.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share with the public the footage, but he vouchs for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was found during an antinarcotic raid held by guards in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of this video, but until recently there had been no evidence.
The mayor himself makes no comment on this.
He just says they're not guilty of anything and he's not going to resign.
The video recorded by the police is one of the evidence of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Lisi, accused of drug trafficking, extortion, illegal income and criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lisa served as the driver of Rob Ford.
The city's residents have long been demanding the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought journalists, appeared drunk in public, allowed himself to be racist and sexist.
Assmann Beraten + Planen recognized the German company as the winner of the tender chosen by the object designer.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaroere does not disclose.
According to the OAU press, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the hospital in the spring of 2014.
The winner has to design a new airport passenger terminal as well as infrastructure facilities, inland roads and airport facilities.
In the first phase of the construction, the terminal area would be 50,000 square metres, possibly further increased.
According to Rostovaeroere Invest, project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and 6 million passengers by 2035.
By the time the tender was closed, the architectural concept of the Southern Aerospace Complex, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects, was defined.
The design of the main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-na-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has the experience of major projects, the company has designed C and E terminals at Sheremetievo International Airport and a new Aerological Complex at Knewichi International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport will be built in the Aksay region of Rostov district and replace the current growth of the airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into the city building.
The start of the construction of the aerospace complex is scheduled for 2014, the introduction of all facilities for 2017.
Turkey's politician announces hunger against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities started building a separation wall in the area of Nusaybin in south-east Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PIC party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish town of Nusaybin Ayse Hekhan, on the border with Syria, protested against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported RIA Novosti in the Press Service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PBM) on Friday.
The police repeatedly fueled protest demonstrations.
Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Muammer Guler, first refuted the construction and then stated that the wall was built to ensure border security.
"Mer Nusaybina Ayse Hekhan, a member of the PMD, has declared hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly fight," said the party press.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from one another, and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhuman situation with which Kurds will never agree," quote Ayse Hekhan of the party's representatives.
According to the press service, a rally against the separation wall is scheduled to take place in Nusaybin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set exchange rates for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - Boliviar - in relation to the dollar for tourists.
On 1 November, Bloomberg reported on this with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travellers are allowed to exchange US$ 10,000 equivalent per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivians purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the diseaser vis-à-vis the dollar will be determined at a later date.
In February, Caracas had to devalue the local currency to 6.3 per dollar.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 Bolivians.
Since the beginning of the year, the Bolivar has lost nearly 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
Raphael Ramirez, Minister of the Oil Industry and Vice President of the Economy, said on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the Bolivarian Republic of Korea.
According to informal information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
Policies to curb prices for products and consumer goods, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, have led to a lack of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Andrey Belmach, Director of Southern Affairs, noted that it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant following the resignation of Sergei Shepelevi.
The resignation occurred just a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, ITAR-TSS says Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find a coach, but someone who's gonna work at our club for a few years and get some results with him.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the media provocative law
“This is a scary place, and there are reasons for the question: what could prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judicial system in the future?” said the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, the parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and a news site.
He said that the new media judicial body “will always be biased because it is a continuation of the Government” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's situation in the global economy.
“I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to his deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to “take the media dead ” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have received a serious blow” and criticized the bill as “drakonovian”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping centre.
Kenyan media have aroused the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras, where troops who were sent to the scene of an attack allegedly looted the expensive mall.
The response of the Chief of Police, David Kimayo, challenged two journalists and media officers to interrogate, although the challenge was lifted after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishing can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being “off-listed”, i.e. to be banned from formal journalistic accreditation.
The Court shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called “living blogosphere”.
Politicians understand that by keeping the media quiet, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote a journalist named Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
“The policies that have been submitted will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of the lifting of the cuts appointed by the national payroll commission and the restoration of their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings per month, which are not taxed, one of the highest in the world.
In the utility charges, the fences will have a new cost line, which is the major repair of the house.
At the most approximate cost, the standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to be paid from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The Government of the region will determine precise standards.
So when you decorate the driveway, bring into order the stairwells, or even replace the elevator, you're going to have to decide for yourself.
Such a law was approved by members of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klonikov, President of the Voronez Regional Duma, noted: “In this case, it is also necessary to establish order — order order of the depository of houses, a accumulation of funds not in the company managers — which we often have registered in Moscow, then in Orenburg, that, somewhere else, it will establish State control over the spending of the funds that the residents collect for the repair of multi-family houses.”
State-controlled construction is now also under way.
The law, which protects against fraud, has been approved by a holocaust in its final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,5 thousand people have been affected by dishonest builders.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law enshrines the rights and responsibilities of all participants in the construction.
Vladimir Klonnikov, president of the Voronez Regional Duma, stated: “It is no secret that abuse has also begun in this area, because in the 98s the debtors had the same hit, and in the 2000s the same debtors.”
People started making money to cover up the loophole, including the two laws.
Voronjem decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals to be deported.
The District Parliament adopted such a law not only under pressure from the Federation.
The problem of illegal migrants in the region is at least dissipated.
For example, in the past year, almost 100,000 foreigners have been placed in immigration records.
But only 1 in 5 formed a formal work permit.
Where the others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klonnikov, President of the Voronez Regional Duma, said: “They have broken the law, but they are not criminals.”
There's no court, but they have to be deported somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation that regional funds should provide such facilities.
In the Voronez region, this place is defined as the Old Olchanka of the Semiluk district.
Well, the regional parliament has recently given new benefits to large-scale parents.
First, families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport taxes.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million, but the same savings are also saved by large-scale parents.
Second, and most importantly, those who adopt the 3rd and the younger will receive housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square metres at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
A family, for example, out of six people -- dad, mom, family, and three -- adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State acquires a dwelling of 108 square metres - 3 million roubles.
For the left bank or south-west micro-region, it's an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the rink for that amount.
Baumgertner nominated to the Board of Directors of Uralkalia.
The current board of Directors of OAO, Uralkaly, has proposed the candidacy of Mink-Genedor Vladislav Baumgertner, a new board of directors, on the Russian company's website.
Bamügertner entered the list of 11 people nominated for the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for the extraordinary Assembly of Shareholders on 29 November, at which a new composition of the Board of Directors would be decided by vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
In his arrest in August of this year, he was charged with abuse of official authority.
Later, however, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, stated at a press conference that Baumgertner's accusations were reclassified as “striking”.
Matthew Dalton's doorman, Matt Dalton, refused to comment on Vladimir Krykunov's resignation from the position of the under-Kamite mentor.
Holkiper believes that Dmitry Balmin, the acting head coach, enjoys great authority from the players and will meet his responsibilities.
Let's just remind you, Nephtechic sent Crykunov to resign today.
To be honest, I wouldn't want to comment on Vladimir Crikunov's dismissal, quote Dalton RIA News.
All I can say is that Dmitry Balmin will meet his obligations, which I have no doubt about.
He has great authority on the team, and this young specialist is certainly looking forward to a great future.
Juventus' protector Leonardo Bonuchi will not help the team in the next match of the Italian champion with Parma.

U.S. Secretary: Secret Service sometimes "go too far" in data collection
The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that in collecting data and auditions, U.S. intelligence services sometimes “go too far,” however, the politician noted that media coverage of 70 million people did not correspond to reality.
I assure you that innocent people did not suffer during this process, but the attempt to collect information was.
Yes, in some cases this has gone too far and has been illegal.
I recognize this, as the President also admits... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future” -- quotes the Secretary of State AFP.
Italian internship workers turn to young people
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the population was unemployed.
So bad has been done since the Second World War.
This rate is several times higher among young people.
40.4 per cent of the population aged 15 to 24 years are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being carried out by the country's largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for employees with an internship.
On the other hand, Italy is looking forward to a common challenge for the ageing population in Europe.
And economists are not sure that the advance rotation of personnel will justify itself.
The construction of TPU in Moscow will lead to
With each year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transshipment nodes.
It is planned to implement 255 TP by 2020.
What's really going on with the project was our correspondent.
A couple of months ago, the Smolensko-Pokrovsko subway started a construction fence.
The inscription said that there was an arrangement for the transshipment node.
This was all very strange, as there is no ground transportation near Smolenska and therefore cannot be moved.
To reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Sadducee ring, we must cross some 130 metres, including a ground crossing through the Karmanic alley.
It's almost over at Smolensko's.
A flower lare, a newspaper stand dismantled, and the asphalt was replaced by a brush.
That's the whole transport unit.
Transport hubs are flat and capitalized - explained in the press service of the capital transport department.
Capital TPUs are not available yet.
The flats include the construction of parking spaces, the removal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and upgrading.
Not even transporters, but professional repairers from the Moscow City’s capital repair department, are even part of a flat-rate TPU.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex construction, explains the director of the Transport Economics and Policy Institute of the Mikhail Blinkin Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes there is enough roof over the head and the board to announce the time of arrival of the transport.
For example, the Yasenevo Metro recently opened a fully-fledged flat cross-sectional node.
No curtains, but with intercepting parking spaces and a board indicating when the bus arrives.
But in the pursuit of the numbers, the clerks put everything in the TPPs.
As early as 2011, the mayor planned to build all 151 knots, 59 of them with capital construction.
The plans up to 2020 now amount to 255 TPs.
One and a half of them promise to give up this year.
Although the city has a TPD development programme, there are no qualitative criteria, notes Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "City and transport".
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of transplants on each of them is often deteriorating.
The expert believes that there should be two criteria: firstly, reduction of transplant time, secondly convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without going into the rain.
In Moscow, when the TPU is repaired, sometimes the opposite is the case.
A bright example of the VDNH subway.
Earlier, suburban buses from the Jaroslav highway came into the well before the main entrance to the WCC.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to the streets of Cosmonauts.
Farther from the subway, much farther than the monarchs, but closer to the dwellings.
It's a shame that the residents didn't want to go under the windows at all and complain about all possible instances.
The capital TPPs in Moscow were not immediately asked.
The first one started building five years ago at the "Plannery" subway.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
Indeed, there has been a sample of how the transplant node, which has been repurchased by investors, has become a banal trading center.
No, there's a Perron for the buses, a rooftop, so we don't go from the subway under the rain, and three floors of the car.
True, Chemical Trolleybus No. 202 and No. 203 did not give the Moscow TP in principle.
They've been pulled away from the subway as strangers.
But there's more to the deal.
It's just 32 stores' clothes, and there's almost everything from zoos to autosalon.
Well, really, then, who's gonna need to buy a new car in the road?
We have a trading center, when they're building a capital T.P.P.U., for some reason they always do.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when part of the car park decided to market.
Now, on the third floor of the TPU “Plannerna” among the parking spaces marked on the floor there is a boycotting trade.
Fruits, spices, Chinese jeans, neurotic speech, and security guards staring at our photographer.
The transplant knot has finally turned into a market.
The point is, before the "Planner" Metro had a market, but they took it down.
In the prefecture, merchants were pityed and put on an intercepting parking lot.
Still, because of the high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market collapsed in order to build in its place... a new flat TP.
It's a rock 'n' roll.
The subway, "Kaluskaya", was 50 metres from the metro lobby to the bus, says Alexander Morozov.
Since the construction of the trading centre, allegedly TPW, the distance has increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you need to get through the whole mall.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, it must pass under the open sky.
After all, the constructions on Plannerna and Caluskaya will soon be displayed with flowers.
In mid-September, the mayoral Land Commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPs.
Four of them will be 25-story, not counting two or three underground poles.
The main monster will grow at the Tusino Metro, with a total of 418.7 thousand square meters of square meters.
Representatives of the RZD railway station in charge of the construction of the TPP in the subway have already told journalists: shops, hotels and apartments will be located in the future.
At the same time, officials believe that multi-line parking lots of mutos from one third to one half of the square.
Take, for example, the "national" garages.
Let's say a garage of 258 machines, recently built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 square metres.
So it's going to take about 80,000 quads to park for 26,000 cars at Petrovsko-Zozumiński.
That's less than a third of the machina they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all the perrons for the buses.
At least 150,000 square metres of commercial property remain.
And this is, for a minute, almost two GUMAs.
If the capital TPs are built by railway stations and railway stations, the remaining sites will be occupied by Metropolitanians.
They also promised that there would be many “functional facilities”, including hotels, offices and even sports facilities.
In fact, in Moscow City Property Department, journalists have recently been told that they are developing a draft decree that investors will be able to apply for a site for TPUs directly to officials.
No contests.
Because, please, transport for the city is a priority.
The perfect TPU is, for example, Harvard Station in Boston or "Snappyna" in Toronto, confident Alexander Morozov.
There the trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the subway level and the distance from the subway to the tram is only 50 metres without access to the street.
There's no extra trade around here.
But Moscow officials are being thrown into extremes.
Either we don't build anything or we just play 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser suggests equating patriotic insults to extremism.
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens against provocations and insults against Russia, righteous Russia proposes to equate the patriotic feelings of extremist activity with the punishment of five years in prison.
According to the News newspaper, such legislative amendments, prepared in advance by the mind committee on energy, Oleg Miheyev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government to obtain an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of the citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional relationship of the person with the country of which he is a national, characterized by love of that country, responsibility for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Miheyev, domestic legislation punishes abuse of formal signs of public authority - flag and herbo.
In the view of the Parliament, the protection of Russians whose feelings can be affected and insulted by public symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country is insufficient in Russian law.
As an example, he brings up the debate every year on the Day of Victory, when some media figures have questioned the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on 9 May - the current vakhanaly is starting on an annual basis.
As a result of histories and an “alternative view” of history, some publicists have come to the conclusion that, regrettably, the cultural Germans have not won the wild Soviet Union!
I find it absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the principal “spiritual fastener” of the nation, Oleg Miheyev resents.
In addition, according to Miheyev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of the believers, while insulting patriotic feelings can be almost unpunished.
In the opinion of the popular electorate, it is necessary to equate the patriotic feelings of extremist activity with the appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The draft provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from a 100-thousand fine to a five-year imprisonment.
The 6.6 Magnitude earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the district of Kokimbo in central Chile, is being handed over by Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean 10.7 kilometres deep and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, and is explained on the US Geological Service (USGS) site.
The pieces were recorded at 8:03 local time (3:03 1 November Moscow).
Nothing has yet been reported about the victims or the destruction caused by the underground blasts.
Let's remind you that Chile is in one of the most seismic regions of the Earth, so the earthquakes of different forces aren't rare.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
At that time, the 8.8 magnitude earthquake and tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in recent history occurred in Chile, where 9.5 Magnitude was recorded in 1960.
More than 5,000 people were killed as a result of that disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case to be dealt with fairly
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the RF announced on Friday that Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict accordance with Russian legislation.
France may have no doubt that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, we hear all concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Ero.
Greenpeace activists are French citizens.
Pierre Pizanu, like the rest of the activists, is charged with bullying.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quote Mr. Ero 'RIA Novosti.
“Our country cannot support activities that could damage the environment, no one has the right to violate laws”, said Dmitry Medvedev in turn.
He said that any structure that tried to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, was dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were “like a powder barrel” and recalled what had taken place in the Gulf of Mexico, was transmitted by RIA Novosti.
UN Proclaims New Goals for Overcoming Poverty
The United Nations must work immediately on a new set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were formulated 12 years ago to overcome global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the MDGs targets, which expire in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro on the eve of the evening.
They were included in the outcome of the document signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that the time had now come “to rise above national interests”.
“I am pleased that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and monitor the implementation of the universal goals of sustainable development,” he said.
These CSDs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to take advantage of the powers given to me by Member States to translate our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of powerful people
At the top of their eyes, the statue of Samora Machel, founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered at the centre of Maputo to scandal the slogans for peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Suss, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed her business costume to a T-shirt decorated with “We Require Security” in Portuguese and joined Thursday by a crowd in the capital area of Independence.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo were received — one of the most brutal clashes since the cease-fire more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once known as the rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will once again face a full-scale conflict, but recent developments have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
Rates are high for a rapidly growing economy, as the discovery of huge shelf gas and coal deposits in the north-west may attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, which has been a political force since 1975, and the Renamo party has accused each other of creating tension.
The Renamo Party argues that the Government has begun to close the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional Renamo fence, on 17 October.
The attacks on former rebels were then aggravated when government forces attacked the Renamo base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the leader of the group, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking the soldiers.
President Armando Gebuz tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Gebuza stated to AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama had felt like a failure who wished to use “everything left of his strength to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew after the report that Mazanga had declared that Renamo had renounced the 1992 Peace Agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that he was referring to non-compliance with the Frellimo party agreement.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
The previous negotiations between the parties have little done to alleviate the tension that has been fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Hebuza and Dhlakama) who have been hit by the foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and none of them are prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reform, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The percentage of votes for Renamo has fallen since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which was founded by the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebusa, who had to leave the post next year, when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He does not want multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency”, Mazanga said.
It is unclear what Renamo is capable of, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but include Beirut, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of rail routes for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was avoided when asked whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo party wanted to “warn the international community that things in Mozambique were not going well," Mazanga said.
Unstableness has increased the Government and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the Mediacoop independent media company.
“People think that the Government and the President are responsible for the country’s future, who must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultan, a participant in the demonstration, said people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want the peace back, they want free access to the roads," he said.
The series of "Art-Myerstrim" premiere films will take place in Moscow
A series of Art-Mystrim movies, where viewers can see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they enter the race, will take place in Rolan cinema from 1 to 5 November, RIA News reports with reference to the organizers of the project.
The programme will be launched by the French film director and actress Reim Kerici "Paris at any price".
It's a story about the Maya model working in the French capital, which is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerrichi's film, the viewers will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Dok "Mebius" by Oliver Hirschbigiel's melodramatic by "Diana: the History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the May Cannes Film Festival "Life Adele" by Abdelatif Keshih.
The only Russian participant in Art-Minstrima will be the winner of the festival "Cinotaur" film by Alexander Weldedinsky "Geographer globes polled" on the basis of one-name novel by Alexei Ivanov.
The lead is Victor Služkin's charming failure teacher, while Constantine Habenssky played in the film, whose work was also marked by the "Kinototavra" prize.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of life”, the author said.
The sayings of Torah could show that “the harsh power cannot defeat subtle trickery” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
In saying that many myths would be “very wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too rude to teach in schools”, Crossley Holland favours “a thorough selection” of suitable texts by age.
“I think it’s wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America,” he said.
I advocated the introduction of them into the training programme for twenty years.
He added that the “excess morals” of authors and teachers “regards” children, while the main ideas are “sublimated” in fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, also wrote the Journal of Norwegian Myths for the publishing of Penguin and British People's Stories, said: “You may certainly have intentions, but you better keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the greater difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or led to a happy ending, but it is essential that there be an innate understanding of right and wrong.
And this has to be sublimed; it's revealed through history, not clearly defined.
Old principle: show, not tell.
In Voronez district, a football fan is being detained, breaking the window in the train station waiting room.
At nine o'clock in the evening, on 29 October, two football fans were removed from the train by the transport police at the station of Grazie Voronez.
After going to the favorite team, the boys on the way set up a drunken deboss on the train.
Young people were brought to the police station in Greece on duty to produce a protocol on an administrative offence.
There the fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police formed administrative material and released it.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and awaited his arrival at the station.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly came back and broke the window of the front door in the train waiting room.
A transport police officer and a POP guard “RJD” ran into the bell of the broken glass.
They were able to apprehend a criminal trying to escape from the scene.
The South-East ILA officers of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs have been screened.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case was resolved, the senior reference to the communication of information and public relations between the South-East Ministry of the Russian Federation on the transport of Sergey Olhovic.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermeans?
I think we're back 15 years ago.
The Minister of Sports Vitali Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots on the rostrum during the match of Kupka Russian Federation Shinnik - "Spartak".
I am in favour of organizing sports events: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we can see that they've taken a long stand.
They're waiting for someone on the side to arrive and order.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
We've got to set up the dentists, the clubs have to invite their stewards, not run the case on their own.
We have now drawn up a special decision by the Government on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
Once it has been adopted, we will deal with the problem.
But I still have to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, make the law quick.
It feels like the Bavarians are here in Yaroslavl and they're all set up.
We're outside observers.
And it's actually terrible to see the rostrum poured out of the brandy.
And that's in the country that's preparing for the world championship.
"I feel like we're back 10 or 15 years ago," Mutko said.
Snowden can interrogate Russia
US special forces expert Edward Snowden will probably not go beyond Russia to testify on the hearing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As Interfax said on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, an American can answer questions from the German Attorney General's Office in writing or directly in Russia.
Edward Snowen's exit from Russia is practically excluded.
“In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by US allies”, said the interlocutor of the agency.
“In principle, however, the Office of the Attorney General of the FWG could send representatives to the RF or refer written questions to Snowden”, added the source, adding that the issue should be addressed at the inter-State level.
Earlier, German Bundestagan Hans-Cristian Shrubele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of the hearing by the US intelligence services of the negotiations of the Chancellor of Germany.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in German territory.
An ex-cop at the CIA made it clear that he knew a lot.
Although the U.S.A. blocked all his movements, Snowden was ready to come to Germany.
However, it is necessary to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival," Srübřel told Euronews.
Lawyer Snowden Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the source Interfax, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide for himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (ANS) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he published information on U.S. security intelligence on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow through transit but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been revoked by the U.S. authorities who had already filed serious charges against him and remained in the Sheremetievo transit zone before early August.
On 1 August, Snowden received a document providing him with temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and left Sheremetievo on the same day.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated that his client was employed by a “large Russian company”.
The German media reported an ANC tracking Angela Merkel last week.
According to journalists, the phone talks of the chancellor began by the Americans in 2002.
The tracking station was reportedly located at the United States Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, following the publication of these reports, stated that the monitoring of Merkel violated German laws and sovereignty.
Pnomarev left Fair Russia.
A Member of the State Duma from the Justice Russia Party, a member of its branch office in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he made a statement to the party ' s New Siberian regional office.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of “justices”.
We're sitting down, drinking tea...
"Sometimes many want to see the painting "Ilja Ponomarov puts on the table of the party," but it's not that epochal," commented the MP's decision.
Pnomarev noted that he maintained good relations with the regional office of `Assers'.
However, Mr. Ilya Ponomarev is not going to give up his mandate.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and was legally unable to leave the party.
Reports of the intention of Ili Ponomarev to leave the Justice Russia party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitry Goodkov and Valery Zubov would come with him from the R.E., but the latter soon refuted the information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of the conclusion of a peace treaty
Head of the Japanese MIDA Fumio Kissida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“I would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, said the meeting of Kissid.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between countries became more warm and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would go to Japan to address complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the disputed North Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today requiring the return of lands lost after the Second World War.
The Japanese capital is driven by cars, from which the loudspeaker reports: “Return the northern territories!”
The police are not stopping the protesters, they are keeping the noise from falling.
Ben Greenman: tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said boldly that New York is the birthplace of a standap comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, Frank Fae, an aristocratic artist at a conference at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
In time, the Fay innovations captured others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and controlled by Caroline Hursh, founder of the standap club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these Hedliners started in Carolines, and then got more successful, reached the level when they were already too famous to join the club,” said Hursh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the Standup for Heroes, the annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where they will appear among Bruce Springston, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Kosby.
The world of comedy also expanded with the expansion of the festival.
Several comedians attending the festival this year have gained popularity in a non-traditional way, for example through shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll is famous for his role in the comedy series on the low-profile cable channel (also known as "Ligae" on FXX on the Fence-Futball theme), and now he's doing his own Comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slatt was involved in both the Saturday Night on Live Air and the Parks and Rest Zones, although it is best known for the series of viral roles "Marselle Rakushka in Boots".
Both Kroll and Slatt, like other young comedians with their own style (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, the evil one focused on the racial theme Kamau Bell), is the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Stainberg started as a standap comedy, but then became a successful director on television and in cinema, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Stainberg.
The meeting will be held in Town Hall, in the heart of Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the central element of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes wandered around a piece between two houses and he thought, "If I'm left with no money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities began talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities began negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the British Embassy, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, is on a visit.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on the negotiations with Islamic extremists during the meeting with British Vice Prime Minister Nick Kleggo, with whom he discussed Pakistan and India's relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister stated that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun, as stated in the statement of the Pakistan Embassy in London.
“He said he hoped and prayed for dialogue to work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan”, the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same-name Afghan movement, but operate independently in north-west areas of the country bordered with Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the creation of an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously attempted to begin negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would only go to negotiations if the authorities took the troops stationed in the areas where the Taliban were operating and released from the prisons of the arrested Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell at a price of $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about large stocks were suppressed by a message showing that China ' s energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining power.
The US oil standard in December was 14 cents, with a price of $96.24 per barrel later in the morning after European time in e-commerce at the New York Stock Exchange.
Thursday, the contract rose by 39 cents, amounting to a fall in October price by 5.8 per cent.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that the United States stocks increased by 4.1 million barrels per week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels have been replenished.
On Friday, however, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports of the Chinese industry, which demonstrated the explosion of its activity.
This indicates that China ' s economic recovery could continue to gain momentum after the third quarter of growth rose to 7.8 per cent after the 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent, a reference class of international oil, also used by U.S. oil-processing companies, went 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Patrick Rua, chief coach of Colorado, explained the decision to release the Sémén Varlamov holika from the first minute in the Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind the bars had not shaken his confidence in the Russians, conveyed Natalia Schmelev from Dallas sokor “SE” .
And what do we have to wait for, said Ru after tomorrow's "Lavin" party.
Of course, what we all are concerned about, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on ice today.
We want him to go out on ice and show his normal level.
So you're absolutely sure that the situation has not changed on the doorman's condition?
We'll see today.
Unquestionably, our players will support Varley by helping him guard the gate, as it was in the previous games of this season.
Mainly, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
There's no need to be a vegan in Siberia: a warm tomato can't replace a soup.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, explained RIA Novosti’s correspondent.
People who have completely abandoned products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
They are not here to carry the winter without loss of health, and no heat tomato compensates them, they are considered by New Siberian nutritionists and doctors who were interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drinks litre oil
Strict vegetarianism, when it gives up not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, the nutritionists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, it is, at least, ineffective for health.
A complete refusal of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by-products.
At least milk or eggs must be included in the diet," says Diethologist Marina Bojay.
It cites, for example, the fish containing the irreplaceable fatty acid Omega-3.
The most abundant of their vegetable oil is linen.
"To need it in human quantities, you must drink liters!" says the nutritionist.
The medical profession is confident that the people of Siberia need to pay special attention to the diet in winter.
Vegetarianism is particularly questionable during this season.
In our realities, there are high requirements for food.
It takes increased calories to keep us from freezing.
“If a person restricts himself to animal products, he does not pick up such calories,” says the specialist.
Olga Pozniak's doctor agreed.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better for a person to feed mainly on foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is geared to better absorbing and digesting these products.
And in the winter people want not a cucumber to bite, but a hot soup or something more intense," the doctor explains.
She said that, from what may be vegans, various grains, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples left in winter, frozen berries.
But this certainly is not enough for a full meal.
According to the gastronomy physician Claudia Arifulina, symbiracies have a vitamin level that is sufficient only in mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, when the temperature can change to 30 degrees per day and snow in May, is inconvenient.
The body needs energy for life, and that's, first of all, fat," says the medic.
Doctors point out that vegans are particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And in keeping with vegetarianism, we give them less than enough.
Pregnant people also need increased protein, vitamins and micronutrients on the menu.
The vegans don't get them, I'm sure of God.
Arifulina says a grown man is willing to choose whatever he wants to play the toys he wants.
He's already got the body, the skeleton, the organs.
Yet, children should eat fully.
If the parents deprive him of any micronuts or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for brain development, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she said.
All medical professionals interviewed agree on the low quality of winter produced in warm and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us by the heat also contains less of the micronutrients we need than (turned) in the open ground.
"The quality of products is not," says God.
Arifulin also notes that imported and heat-treated vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Some of the producers ’ desire to harvest larger crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples don't become brown on a slice, the cucumbers are rapidly yellowing and clapping, the tomatoes are tasteless and unpalatable," says the medical examiner, adding that they are likely to be bloated by an excessive amount of fertilizer.
And they're not vitamins, they're cells.
This is not accepted by the mastermind of the Siberian Institute of Agrarian Physics and Technology, candidate of the Vera Petruk agricultural sciences.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all the rules and requirements in the heat, full vegetables could be grown.
If they try to drive more out of a square metre, they will, of course, become more frequent and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers are growing quickly, tomatoes are large but watery and light", she explains, adding that the issue of quality depends primarily on the manufacturer's conscience.
Court suspended enforcement of the decision on “stop-and-search” in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring changes in the police department's “stop-and-seek” programme and suspended the judge from the case.
The United States Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Shira Scheindlin ' s decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of the city ' s appeal.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the constitution by implementing the street arrest and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and decision on remedial measures, including the requirement to appoint a controller, to assist the police department in changing its work practices and its related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate by the parties on a motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to dismiss a judge because it violated the code of conduct of US judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing prejudice, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by misrepresenting the black and Latin American people under the “stop-and-search” programme.
She appointed an external controller to oversee major changes that included policy, training and control reforms, and also decided to launch a pilot programme to test television cameras in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to put an end to the practice of storing names and addresses of people on whom cases had been terminated after the police inspection.
The debate on the city's appeal should be held after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic was criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The search has been conducted for several decades in some form, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically with the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a collective action.
The supporters of the change in the “stop-and-search” programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to bad practice, form a more reliable and effective police service and may influence how other police departments are carrying out this practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce the military spirit of the police, rather than the crime rate, lead to unnecessary money losses and will not solve the more global problem of the police situation due to a reduction in the number of officers by several thousand in the past decade.
The judge noted that the practice of “stop-and-search” was consistent with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the area of the Trekakov Gallery
A new pedestrian zone appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Trekakov Gallery and occupies a two-kilometre station from the Novokuznskaa Metro station to the Bolotno Square.
All along, there are street bags, flower shops, feces, bathrobes and toilets, clothes for deaf people and illegal advertising.
In addition to the Klimentovsky and Lavrušín alleyways, which were already pedestrians, five streets were closed - Ordinsky deadlock, the Great and the Small Tolmacheval alleys, the Kadashev Coastal and the Bolt Square.
Transport on the streets of Marosaica and Petrolka is not limited.
On the Friday Street section, the conditions for pedestrians have been created without removing the movement and cutting the carriageway, passing newsmsk.com to the Klimentov Strait.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Trejakov Gallery, the temple of the priest Clement of the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments, and other attractions.
Previously, the Tver Pass, the Stolesniks’ alleys and the Kuznetsky Bridge were completely pedestrian.
The large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, was determined to close cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone break-in to verify a confidential message
The former editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used a “phone, surveillance and counter-insurgency” in an attempt to corroborate false information about Charles Clark's novel, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, Royal Lawyer Andrew Eddis, informed the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, the News of the World received a mistrustful news that Clark was meeting with Hanna Polby's “a very attractive special adviser”.
The paper ordered private detective Glenn Mulkeir to break Polby’s voicemail and alert her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails, and he heard the court.
“The prosecution considers that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will be standing outside someone’s house hoping to find someone suddenly, is a man who likes to offer history to people to see what they say,” said Mr. Eddy.
He said that the News of the World had used three ways of investigating history: telephones, surveillance, and opposition.
An editor himself involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone break-in?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes! "
Rumors of Clark's novel drew attention for the first time to the news of the World, when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A tape with voice messages received from her phone at least three times was withdrawn from the house of Mulkeir in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as “Projects”.
During the period when she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls requesting information, Mr. Eddy said.
At the time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weserap were overseeing Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we are planning to publish tomorrow and that I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Eddy said that Coulson's involvement in this story was based on the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blancett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blancett about a marriage affair with a married woman while he was meeting Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiracy with other people to break into phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkeir, Turlbeck, and Weserap confessed to breaking into phones.
Snowden states his willingness to communicate with the authorities of the FWG in the wiretap case
The CIA expert Edward Snowden is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to meet with representatives of the authorities of the FRG and sends RIA Novosti.
A letter from a former CIA official to the FWG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by a member of the Bundestag Hans-Cristian Shrbele, through whom Snowden sent a message to the German authorities.
On the eve of the day, he met Snowden in Moscow.
Four people were injured as a result of fire on Tver Street
As a result of a fire in a collector in downtown Moscow, on Tverska Street, four passersby were injured.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in emergency services, one of the victims is hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-bys were hit during the fire in a cold underground passage.
According to RIA Novosti, with reference to the head of the capital department of fuel and energy management of Paul Levinsky, electricity has now been fully restored in all homes on Tver Street.
Fire in a heat collector near home 15 on Tver Street took place on the night of 31 October.
There was a heavy smoke coming from the sewer hatches, and smoke was created in the underground passage at the Armenia store.
As a result of the fires, 11 houses on the Tver Street have been destabilized.
At 9:45 a.m., the fire was eliminated.
United States cuts in food allowance for the poor
The food allowance for the family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday in the United States, the financial provision of food vouchers known as "Foudstempa" has been reduced since the end of the relevant public programme.
Officials say that the food allowance of a family of four will now be less than $36 per month than before.
This will affect 47 million poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the 2012 financial year, one person's allowance was an average of $133 per month.
Food aid expenditure in the United States increased to $80 billion a year owing to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid provided by the "fudstemps" that have been known since the time when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress required further reductions in funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should aim at helping those who needed more.
Food shopkeepers across America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
The U.S. congressmen continue to argue about how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard made a 19-year-old platform free of charge
The Blizzard studio released its 1994 Blackthorne platform on PC free of charge.
WoW Insider reports it.
According to his data, the game is available in Battle.net in the section of classic Blizzard games.
However, some gamers note that only users whose accounts are part of the United States service can now jump it.
For Russian users, the game is also not available yet.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC does not seem to be different from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorne Soundtrek has also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne Platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally appeared on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and bright kingdoms.
One day the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill Light King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to confront Sarlak’s paratroopers and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game the studio ever released after her name was changed to Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was the Interplay company.
There will be new machine guns in Moscow's metropolis.
But they're not going to sell tickets to passengers for money, they're going to be selling tickets to their seats.
One trip worth 30 roubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 landings.
The number of visits will count a special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TSS referring to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first equipment will be installed at Exhibition station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new ticket athletes, the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic champions Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamoldchikova will be welcomed.
Recognition by the National Security Agency reinforces corporate paranoia in relation to public monitoring
On a warm day at the end of August, the German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
As instructed by the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, its task was to photograph the roof of the United States Mission, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV had hoped to detect listening devices antennas, and these actions had led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Klepper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States did not use external intelligence “to steal commercial secrets from foreign companies in the interests of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractual servant who has become a public defender, he has started publishing to his treasurer the secrets of US intelligence, European governments, and company leaders, whether he can be trusted by the director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and obtained access to data stored by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised paranoia of corporations caused by the monitoring of the State to new altitudes.
The last drop was to report that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been on the phone for about ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made it clear that there was intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it's quite likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up”, says Oliver Grun, president of BITMI, who represents the German IT and IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US is now presenting almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published by the EY Advisory Agency in July.
All documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden have yet to show that the United States has transferred the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some information technology and the Internet, and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical of that.
Someone in the German Parliament says we need to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It’s not an option,” said Gusso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, it was not worth letting her die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany from coal to cars and farmers.
Everyone but the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of U.S. espionage agencies, known as Snowden's revelations, has been a shock to some companies that used to think that China represents the greatest risk of surveillance.
There has been a major shift in cloud technology, where the leaders of European companies are better aware that data stored in the United States are within the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of non-American participants refused to use the US-based cloud-based provider following the release of the US-based intellectual data analysis programme Prism.
Jim Sneeb, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: “We see that consumers are asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction”.
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are merely evidence that they already knew that powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore that data should be protected at any cost.
What is happening in economic espionage is not surprising.
He's always had a scene.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bok, Chief Executive Director of the chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we're spying on them too, because it's part of our national interests -- to protect our business.
Corporation leaders usually do not like to boast about the counter-actions they have taken, as this may give an advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long adopted the idea that taking a free flash drive on the exhibit or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is, at least, unwarranted.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi Automotive Company, said that for many years it was standard practice to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they could not be used as listening devices.
The Federal Constitutional Protection Service of Germany recommends that company managers consider the possibility of using simple overpaid mobile phones during foreign travel owing to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discharged.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to burglary and surveillance.
In Germany many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niches.
“Little and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns the BfV report.
The US has warned its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report placed France with Russia and Israel in the second series of hackers for economic exploration after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “French is worse than all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency, DCRI, said in an interview this month: “Services know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies”.
Parents of a teenage girl from Georgia who died of “indescribable accident ” think their son was killed
The parents of a teenage girl from Georgia whose body was found inside a closed gymnasium in his high school gym, believe that their son was killed, declared a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta State of Georgia was found in a vertically standing mat in the back of his high school gymnasium, on 11 January.
Researchers in the Loundes County Sheriff's Department have concluded that Johnson died of a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old family is challenging this.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was killed”, said FoxNews.com Benjamin Krump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says he did.
“They think that this is contrary to logic, to the laws of physics, and to common sense,” Kramp said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or the people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they returned him to their corpse bag,” he said.
US attorney Michael Moore stated Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of the crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to know the truth.
“I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of a “positional asphyxiation”.
However, the second discovery, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are several questions that should be resolved or clarified”, he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to require criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A representative of the Loundes Sheriff's Department was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
Judge South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to publish all video footage of the surveillance cameras that the investigators were looking at.
A teenager’s parents said that they hoped that video recordings contained the key to understanding how he died.
“Spartacus”: For information on the persons who hung the fascist symbol
On the official website of Spartacus, a statement from the Moscow Club concerning the arrival of a flag at Jaroslavla.
On October 30, the "Spartacus" cup match, the unknown provocateurs at the Jaroslav Stadium displayed a fascist symbol.
Call on all who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to provide it
“Remuneration is guaranteed” is stated in the statement.
We're looking for fans hanging a fascist flag in Jaroslavla.
Let's remind you that in the 1/16th match, the Russian Kubka "Shinnik" - "Spartak" was interrupted several times by riots on the stands.
Fascist symbolism has also been demonstrated in the Spartacus disease sector.
In the form of punishment, Spartacus may hold about three unattended matches.
A meeting of the Committee will take place on Friday.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations for schools on child allergy
On Wednesday, disease control and prevention centres published a list of recommendations for control of food allergies among children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. Government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff serving with regard to food allergies among children and how to help in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenalin supplies — most often for injections, used automatic EpiPen medical syringes — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to make their supply of adrenaline less difficult.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is stuck in my tongue”, “the feeling that I have hair in my tongue” or “the tongue of my tongue”.
Parents of intersexual children can choose “unspecified sex”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born to outside sex of the intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be assigned male or female.
The new law does not require parents to call the sex of such children, allowing parents to identify the sex as “unspecified” or “undetermined” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to eliminate the pressure on parents who could make hasty decisions on sex-adaptation and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
One intersexual person, according to BBC, said many years later, “I am not a man or a woman”.
I'm going to be the doctor-made piece with bruises and scars.
Some of the 2,000 children born each year are neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological formations that are diagnosed as “sex development disorders” — a collecting term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (maternals or sperm) or abnormally developed outside sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
Gender identification has not been sufficiently studied yet, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before the operation, if any.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dresher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require rapid intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign the floor without an operation and then see how the person develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexuals as different from transsexuals or transgenders, because their condition is not gender-related, but rather their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typical of both.
These characteristics can be seen in secondary sexes, such as muscle mass, the distribution of hair cover, breast and body; primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice-based crime.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put male, female or third sex in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Walby became the world's first person recognized as a “dissolved” person to remain in court for a lifetime of “undetermined” sexual status.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third symbol in addition to M and F to X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still contradictory, according to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove a “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also disagreed with the German law, wrote that “in a situation where the world is getting involved in a new state where sex is the subject of choice, and sexual activity is not, we turn two more pillars of civilization”.
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have children set up sex at birth.
“It is hard enough to grow a child without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child”, she said to the parent’s website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitals were called Hermaphrodites — in the name of a beautiful Greek god, who had signs of both sexes.
And ten years ago, the medical community saw a gender as a leaf that could be wiped out and then painted again.
But now many argue ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and the doctor sometimes makes the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called an urgent psychiatric case,” Dreser said.
When such children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of John Hopkins University, who believed that a gender could be easily altered.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals — how parents grow the child — interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case, in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during the negligent circumcision, castrated the child completely, removed his eggs, and raised him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not,” Dreser said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dresner said that some doctors are still “using this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these sex-changing operations claimed themselves, “an unsatisfactory result”.
That was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate-type genitals.
The doctor could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that he would never be able to live a man’s “full life”.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genitals and ovaries were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He started giving female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was assigned to vaginal plastics.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he knew was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Once he learned the truth, he became a man again, receiving his testosterone shots and removing his breast.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he is defending others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring people into a normal sense of intersexuality.
But Anne Tematís, Executive Director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “promots to cheer the labels and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an “indefinite sex””, she said.
We fear that it will help to intervene.
We believe that it is better to adopt male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Theor-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because “it allows adults to make choices in favour of the third sex”.
“Adolescents should be able to make their own decisions on formal gender,” she said.
The German law implies attribution at birth.
This is a battle in which young children should not enter this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Barac, an X-ray mom from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual abuse and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law “support” both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called the “androgen insensitive syndrome”.
Since her androgen receptors are not working properly, Katya has developed female signs.
She's got a vagina, but she doesn't have a uterus or ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Kathy is married to a child psychiatrist's office at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own,” Barac said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and analysis of the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "man" or "woman".
In such a case, you are fine — raise a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“This allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that parents move because they do not feel that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
Eventually, the child will decide with which sex he or she is more comfortable — and this is wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago doorman Nikolai Habibulin emphasized that he understood that he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Habibulin first missed six pucks from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game it was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I have failed, CSNChicago says Habibulin.
- I have to find confidence in practice, and I think I should approach them as a game, and try to achieve a better outcome.
You must study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been encountered.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in practice, I feel pretty good.
But somehow after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snow coma.
Maybe I need to relax a little bit.
The gatekeepers, I don't think I'm so alone, they're always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not happy.
No matter what happens in front of my gates.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so many pucks.
It's great that my uni-clubs are supportive, but in principle, it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games isn't the whole season, but I wanted to do them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'll just try to play the next match better.
A bus turned over on Altay.
A PAZ cruise bus was turned over to the Rubtsov district of Altay Province.
As a result, 13 people were injured by the DTA, according to the updated data, in the regional management of the MRF.
Earlier, the law enforcement authorities of the region reported 10 victims.
According to the department, the accident occurred about 9 a.m. on the local time on the road of Novonikolaevka - Vishneva, 1 km from Novonikolaevka.
On a bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, there were 12 passengers and a driver, all of whom were injured in a different degree of severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to Rubtsovska City Hospital, two persons hospitalized at Rubtsovska Cemetery.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 to be deployed to Europe
Russia expects that the Superjet 100 aircraft will be placed in Europe once the markets of Latin America and Asia have been established.
“We hope that, in total, we will receive more than 170 copies of such aircraft,” said Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of Russia’s Interfax at a press conference with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but it is hoped that once this aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also become our partners in Europe.
“I hope he'll ever be in France,” the Russian Prime Minister emphasized.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by the Suhogo Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Leiner developed on the basis of modern technologies and offered high standards of quality and comfort in a segment of 100 passenger seats.
Dnepropetrovsina energy has begun a unique rescue program... the nests of the aristians.
In an old age, the peasants on a high stake were able to get a wheel from the calf, and the heavy nest was holding it well.
Such special supports are long gone, so the aristians love the power lines - the interlaced branches rely on the wire, making the austrian hut stand secure.
Anja's grandmother, whose asist family has been living in the village of Ivanovka Petrik in the region for twenty years, began to notice the nest sitting in spite of the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are putting new branches on top of them, and the bottom layer is already clearing between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, a pity for the seven aristians who nested in the yard every year, brought and fed three or four birds in the summer, but without light, they would not want to remain.
As soon as the birds flew to warm lands, Anja’s grandmother called the Imperial RES, which is owned by the resistance.
And I didn't even expect them to respond so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, said Technical Director of DTEC "Dneproplainergo" Sergey Berezowski.
The wires, which appeared to be essentially corrosive inside the nest, weighing between 150 and 200 kilograms, began to corrosive.
At any moment, the birds could have died of an electrical discharge.
Even locals risked losing light because of wire damage.
Therefore, the liners have launched a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from Dnepropetrov National University who developed a nesting scheme helped.
They did training for district staff.
A prominent Dnepropetrovian ornithologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, advised energy at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that more than 50 auspicious “accommodations” were in the area of emergency.
Special metal platforms resembling a crow were welded for their reconstruction.
The foundation was wrapped in silk branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to the experts, it is sufficient to lay the old branches as a basis for the birds to know the nest and return to it.
After that, the aristians will build their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka of Novomoskov region.
A new railway pole was installed near the power station and a platform with an old, already-used nest was placed on it.
The whole operation has run out of nine thousand grives of energy.
On the day, the same novelty took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikov district in the courtyard of Ani's grandmother.
Here, the platform was secured in its original position, just above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that careful, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “accommodation” has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected to be done by four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Kiričan districts of Dnepropetrovstina.
By the way, while rare birds are being rescued, others are being ruthlessly killed.
The whole area was surrounded by sad news — in the village of Ust Kamenka Apostolov district, on the day of the start of the hunt for pheasants, poachers shot a swans family on a local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds did not fear at all the people who were fed and wronged by the locals.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, and the four swans were already lying dead on the water.
Now the members of the Apostolic Paradise police find out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
Russian March is becoming more popular
On 4 November, on the Day of National Unity, the Russian March will be agreed with the Mayor of Moscow.
According to the Levada Centre survey, support for Russian marches has increased, with 40 per cent of citizens at different levels agreeing to the idea of carrying them out.
According to Levada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens approve of Russian marches to various degrees: 11 per cent of them are definitely positive and 29 per cent are "rather positive".
The popularity of “Russian Marches” is growing gradually, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed in 2006 and twice as many citizens (28 per cent) have already been supported in December 2010.
"Absolutely negative" to "Russian marches" are only 7 per cent of Russians, "rather negative" is 19 per cent.
A further 35 per cent could not formulate their attitude towards this action.
This year, Moscow's mayor agreed to hold a Russian march of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, which was reported today by the Head of Security of the capital, Alexei Maiorov.
This nationalist action has been taking place every year on People ' s Unity Day since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, "Have you heard that the Russian marches are held in Russia on 4 November under the slogans for the protection of Russian rights in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of citizens replied negatively.
Only 1 in 5 Russians (20 per cent) now know about this stock.
It is remarkable that almost one third of the citizens were heard about the Russian march in December 2010 (31 per cent).
Recall that three years ago, on 11 December, a natural rally of nationalists took place in Manning Square, which turned into mass unrest.
Levada-Centre also asked the Russian about the date of the celebration on 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (National Unity Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
After all, only 15 per cent of citizens are going to celebrate this celebration.
Approximately the same (17 per cent) intention is to celebrate the Day of the October Revolution on 7 November.
Most of the citizens (62 per cent) are not going to observe any of these holidays.
As the Moscow Mayor agreed "Russian March" in Lublin
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March in Ljubljana on 4 November.
The leader of the Russian Federation, the organizer of the march Dmitry Demishkin, reported this.
In addition to going to Ljubljana on People's Unity Day, there will be a rally and a rock concert by the Colosseum group, also agreed with the authorities.
How did the Russian March 2012 go?
On the Day of National Unity, in 2012, the nationalists passed the sixth from the Jakimano Coast to the Central Artist's House, where a rally took place.
The organizers evaluated the number of participants in 20,000, and the Ministry called the figure 6,000.
Communication: Obama election headquarters considered Bayden's exception in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's immediate advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Baden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This is the most vivid sensation from all of Mark Galperin's and John Hailemann's expected book on the 2012 "Runs doubled: Game changed 2012" campaign.
The Times received a copy of a book ready to go and reported on Thursday evening that the nearest President's assistants had conducted “a large-scale study in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Bayden's exclusion could help raise the waning hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to the political columnist The Times, Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by senior election headquarters and White House officials, namely, the former White House administration chief Billa Dayly, to assess the effect that the former Secretary of State Clinton would have on the vote as Vice-President.
Possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded election headquarters in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only six of the President’s closest advisers — including Daley, the former head of Obama’s election headquarters, Jim Messin, and former senior advisers to the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that replacements were under consideration.
The book "Stoves doubled" claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden despite their “close personal relations”, but eventually abandoned this step when their data showed that Clinton's addition to the electoral list would not “immediately improve Obama's chances”.
In an interview with Martin Dayly, the Administration did indeed consider replacing Baiden Clinton.
“I actively advocated the consideration of a multitude of things, and it was one of them,” said the daily newspaper.
You must remember that the President was in terrible shape at that time, so we thought, "Oh my God, what are we to do?"
Although Daley described the study as “necessary inspection”, Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the election headquarters had invested a lot in studying whether the dividend would bring this step to the vote.
“The pre-election headquarters don’t spend that much money on interviews and focus groups unless they consider something serious”, said Martin in AC 360.
It was unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had been studying the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if he knew his boss at the time about a possible crash.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the President was aware of a possible replacement, the former Head of Administration admitted that Obama knew “possible”.
Martin added that Stavki doubled does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political sensing had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he considered it serious that Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of removing Baden from the electoral list.
“Possible”, said Martin.
You want a glow in the dark of the ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first lighted, dark-frozen jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop a glowing meal.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and convinced the Chinese scientists to reinvent the glowing protein chemically.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the eater, raising the pH in the protein and causing it to shine.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to light up when it responds to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lisme, I'm yummy," says, "This is an amazing thing, but it's still at the very beginning when it comes to production, so for £200 you get about 2 g of substance."
The protein that we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up, it'll raise your pH and start to light up.
We've been testing it over the past few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it's creating such a wonderful luminous effect.
This may be the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because the luminescence of the jellyfish is four times the price of gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and creamy gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It's not possible, by definition, because of the fracture caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Coach "Avangarda" Vladimir Chebaturkin, referring to the preparation of his team for the match of the regular KHL champion against Salawat, noted that the omichi carried out a thorough analysis of the defeat of the Magnito-Gorian Metallurga.
The specialist stressed that Avangardu should be given increased attention to the defence game.
We watched the video match against the Mathellurg Magnitogor's Metallurg, which brings up the official web site "Avantgard" by Chebaturkin.
- You missed a lot of pucks, not a very nice moment.
They missed out on their mistakes because of the failure to perform the game.
We knew the rival had the performers.
According to the statistics, they had five attacks from the move, three pucks killed us.
Very good implementation.
These errors were taken into account in preparation for today's game?
With our boys, each match is carefully understood, talked after the game, getting ready for a new rival.
The main thing is that the installation is being implemented.
Everyone saw the first season of the Metallurga match.
The game was done, and the score was 2-0.
They missed a goal in the locker room, and in the third period, they made mistakes.
Given the difficulty of playing, I didn't see the point of connecting the defense attorneys.
Defend yourself with the entire team.
Now, Avangarde has a long home series, the matches go in a day, and the team's tired?
All teams are in the same condition.
The key now is the realization of your moments and the performance of the game.
Hockey's an emotional game, if you're doing your job, it's not that hard.
Because of the new regulations introduced by Russian Customs, hundreds of coaches have been standing in line on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Presently, small - time officials promised to provide drinking water and biotuals to drivers
Hundreds of vans were copied at border crossings when Russia entered.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules governing the customs administration of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the turn creates a Russian side that has not warned of innovations in advance.
Since 28 October, Russian Customs authorities have taken additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, according to Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
Passing points work in an enhanced mode.
The correspondent, FACTOV, visited the border and communicated with the far-off fighters who were held hostage to the situation.
Prices in the coffee-travel shop at the Novoazovsk Pass are rising every day, as is the row from the van.
The trucks stand in several rows, rising about two kilometres.
The Novozazovsk Customs Terminal, Veselo-Voznesenka, provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the goods are sent to Stavropolsk province of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday through midnight, they were still running, and after the rules were introduced, Alexei Golovanev, a long-distance fighter (in a photo) who was taking goods from Turkey to Kazakhstan transiting through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and a cargo insurance package.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which it is carried.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 rubles (about 1100 - 1300 grivins).
Those who travel nearby (saying to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 roubles (3,800 grivins) and drive by.
The rest of them are stuck. No one has that much money with them.
Imagine, if the driver carries a load of only $4000, but all the way to Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 grevens) to pay for his transit!
The conditions for survival on the border -- no, no, they're sitting on the side of the car.
In border stores and cafes, it's always expensive, but prices like this, we never met anywhere!
The sellers were focused and quickly developed: 15 grubs are worth a baton, seven cup of coffee, 25 grivin is a bowl of soup.
And the coffee shop's alone.
There's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppes, that's where we go to the bathroom.
Don't wash, don't shave...
I can stay out of the car for a week. My wife's on the way.
I'll give you a week, he's comforting another long-range fighter, Victor Scottarenko.
Is my car gonna be in line in a week?
Why do you have a pound and a pound of vodka? We're interested in the only border shop.
There's 11 and 15 grubs.
What, is the bottle of crystal or the water pressing on silver?
We have coffee, not a store.
Get something while there's something else, it's steaming up the seller.
After media coverage of the situation, Ukrainian drivers were brought to the attention of the region's authorities.
The leadership of the Amvrosiev and the Novozazov Raigosads were given the task of providing all those who lined up on the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water - said the Acting President of the Donetsk siege administration, Sergei Dergunov.
Emergency teams are now on duty at checkpoints.
Biotuals will also be installed for people's convenience.
According to the official, the issue of the order will be resolved within the coming days.
As of 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles were freed at the international crossings of Usprenka and Novaazówsk, respectively, as reported by the Donetsk Olysation Press Service.

Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to engage in information provocations against the high-ranking people of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership - such a statement was made to the BNS in the Department of State Security (DGB).
Information on this is published on the DelFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is about to “negotiate” the President of Lithuania, Dalu Gribauskaite, and to publish the fake documents allegedly found in the Russian Hosarchive, which relate to the facts of the Lithuanian leader's biography.
According to the intelligence service, the Department of Information Research is conducting an analysis of public processes in the administration of the Russian President's administration on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania on several occasions and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People ' s Party.
A member of the operation is also reportedly a member of the Department of B. Smirnov.
According to the Special Service, Smirnov, under the cover of scientific work until the end of 2012, regularly visited Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now prohibited from entering the country.
On the eve of the day, President Gribauskaite stated that she knew about the information she was preparing for.
In her view, the main reasons were the successful presidency of Lithuania on the Council of the European Union and “the country's aspirations to energy independence”.
The Lithuanian leader has not once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She thus claimed that in Kremlin, Lithuania was “inadequately respected”.
In addition, Gribauskaite accused RF head Vladimir Putin of moving to Lithuania “one claim only”.
To remind you, in September, Ross needed to suspend the import of the Lithuanian hammer into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products was not in line with sanitary and epidemiological standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare a petition to WTO.
In the United States, the director of the school fired on teenagers.
The director of one of the U.S. High Schools had literally led to despair.
The man said he had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, juvenile hoodlums threw a man’s home with toilet paper.
As a result, the school director opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not on the Director ' s property, he was charged with assault under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125 thousand.
Notably, shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Literally on the eve, a man opened fire in the center of Ridgecrest, California, just across the street.
Then the criminal took two random passers-by hostages, hid them in the trunk of the car, and tried to hide.
In the early years of primary school in Newtown, Connecticut, there was a shooting.
Adam’s mother worked at school, and she was a tutor.
Shooting at an American school: a 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat confetti, and we were allowed to stay up late to bed and have a masquerade for our area.
I'm more like a circle now.
I haven't been invited to give out candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I probably won't do it this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white crow with regard to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on confetti, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that costumes will go $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion spent.
This year, on the peak of fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer need to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizzas, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I think we'll see a lot of zombies coming from the Walking Dead, and I'm sure the Daft Punk-style cosmonauts will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the costumes most commonly sought are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
I don't think there's anything wrong with the traditional approach.
We ordered our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million on pet suits this year.
That means a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to confetti, we don't talk.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chewing coffee and Clark Bar candy.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is excellent news for 41 million confety-needed children who have prepared to subdue our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and — we will not deceive ourselves — we will eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is corn-grain confetti; yet, according to the National Association of Capitols, nearly £35 million is sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses Halloween as much as houses with ghosts.
They have shocking names, such as “Woe and Shout House” (which, by the way, is in the real prison), “Woe and Shout House”.
Moreover, according to the American Hunts community, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses in America that generate about $500 million of income, as well as those shocking photos where you almost described what your friend put on Facebook, and you can't take away, and then the guy that you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like a "class face".
And in conclusion, let's talk about the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Tikou when we were kids, and cutting Jack's flashlight is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for the baby in the week only started last year because of Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack's lighthouse, slowly draining on your wing, probably came from Illinois State, which raised £542 million this year.
If you want a job more complex, visit Tim and Susan Metison in the city of Napa state of California and try to cut out some of their pumpkin weights in £2032.
Estonia's Minoboro site was restored after the Ukrainian hackers attacked
Estonia's Ministry of Defence's work was restored after the morning cyberattack, reports the press service of the agency.
According to Deputy Chancellor Minoboron on information and administrative matters of Timer Peter, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded by a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly fixed everything, so far the site has been restored.
"The damage suffered to the Ministry is minimal," said the St. Peter to the Posttimes edition.
According to Peter, it was early to talk about who had organized the attacks.
“We will necessarily analyse the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents”, he admitted.
On the contrary, on 1 November, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted an address on the web in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the site of Minoborona Estonia and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We must not be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
There's no need for Russia either.
Ukraine must not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says the statement Anonymous.
Earlier, Ukraine reported that the company of the Marine Infantry of the Feodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps would participate in NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 team training exercises.
A number of schools and hospitals had to be closed because of the violence
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabelle had to be closed because students were attacked by... goblins.
As the local elder said, the children were panicking, and continuing their studies proved impossible.
The story of goblins may sound like an invention of a child for a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument to close the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean forces.
In summer, for example, Zimbabwe closed down a hospital because the staff were also attacked by goblins.
Land Rover Award announced
Inward seats and six-point seat belts, as well as internal communications systems, are located.
Additional upgraded brakes, a package of services providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between activities.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rallyers who applied to Bowler have changed”.
Some of them are not experienced drivers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to propose such a way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try the different disciplines of the rally in Britain and abroad, and to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally-read.
We were very happy to develop the Defender Challenge, which would be a really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian forces are not aware of the Bratsky Circle group - New Messages
INTERFAX.RU writes about this by referring to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the RF.
"After the media reported that the U.S. Ministry of Finance had put Leps on the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurovision criminal syndicate 'Bratsky Circle', we looked at all databases, but did not find such a group," said the interlocutor of the agency.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributed to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously stated, the U.S. Treasury Department released a list of alleged members of the criminal group "Brother Circle" on its website yesterday.
Among them was Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Grissa," put it on the front page.
With data from a popular Russian executive, they coincide.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevridze, creative name, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned there.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a Uzbek citizen, and another ex-USSR, whose nationality is not indicated.
In the United States, they are confident that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was carrying money for bandits on their orders.
A photograph of the singer is attached to this communication and all of its data, which correspond to the validity of the song.
Moreover, Lepps actually recently bought a house in Phuket.
In the department, they indicated that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of the American Minfine entails freezing his assets in the United States and prohibiting the business of persons living in the United States.
Lips' assistant, Maja Serikov, said that no notice to the singer was received: “It is difficult to answer the question whether it is Gregory, who is now being talked about in connection with the U.S. scandal”.
All Leps knows is media coverage.
Officially, there were no notifications to him, although I do not know if they exist in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, surprising and unexpected," she declared RIA Novosti.
According to her, in Phuket, Gregory Leps does not live, but according to the U.S. Minfin, he does have a home on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had caught him during his flight to Blagovechnsk.
Escaped in a field at Shinnik's match.
Some details of the fan's identity were made known, which ran to the field during the 1/16 match final of Kubka Russia between Jaroslav Shinnik and Moscow's Spartacus.
As head of KDK RFS Arthur Grigoryantz said, referring to the data of the IMF, this boulder is Moscow.
He's currently in custody.
"In addition, Grigoriantz described how the fan managed to break into the field: "It was clear that the one, called the viewer, had gone to help with the escort of two spectators, referring to problems with the heart.
He came to the ambulance, that's what the doctor confirmed to us.
Then he pushed two escorts away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the Eastern and Southern rostrum to the corner of the Eastern and Northern rostrum.
He ran all over the field.
That's what stewards are responsible for.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sport Act, this flight attendant area of action cannot be interfered with by the police in the field.
He reached the rostrum, crossed the Eastern rostrum.
At that time, riots began on the eastern rostrum and on the treadmills," said the head of the KDK.
Recall that by decision of the KDK, Moscow Spartacus will hold the upcoming 15th round of the Russian championship against Lokomotiva and Zenita, and will pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.
Fire teams were called to save a lost puppy who got stuck 50 feet above the ground at a dangerous career retreat.
Coker Spaniard Ruby ran away after she got into a little accident.
Three days later, she was stuck in a career and noticed a man walking a dog.
Firemen went down on a rope down the slope to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was fortunate to be saved after the fire teams were called to lift him up and take him to a safe place after he somehow stuck at 50 feet on a dangerous retreat.
Ruby's nine-month-old co-worker ran away after she got into a car accident on Sunday, and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her host, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Flappit's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They feverishly searched for their missing dog and posted social networking sites after she fled to a career after a minor accident.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a star dog saw Ruby stuck at 50 feet on a career retreat.
A technical rescue unit from the Klekchiton fire station rushed to the scene, went down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used a wire to lift her up the slope.
Andie Clayton, a rescue officer, said, "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of the spring slope, 50 feet [50 m] to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move, and she had a muscle to save, and she was completely dead.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate a cookie.
That was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Peter Lau, a rescue officer, said, "Ruby was very lucky to have been rescued."
It was likely that she could have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection, and she was found to be fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching salvation was scary”.
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was back in our hands.
The vet said that if she hung up and lost consciousness, she'd probably fall.
The fires were great.
It was very brave — what they had done.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of the city of Kitley added: “We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there.”
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play Katie Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, the pop-star declared that she was a bec-vocalist for the 2004 Jagger song Old habitats die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker, and she said, "He played with me when I was 18 years old."
She added: “It was a long time ago, and it was very good.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative of the seventieth-year-old Jagger said that he “rejected that he had ever hit Katie Perry”.
The representative added: “Perhaps it confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who showed up as guests at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: Europe’s gap gives Scottish people a choice
Another day, another independence scarecrow.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
There's a series of passport control stories in Berwicke and a barbed wire line along the Adriananova shaft.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although — predictablely — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU member countries spend a lot of time turning their formal rules as convenient as they could.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap assignment for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from Scottish people.
So it's not a worthy story.
And so old that it became a fossil: for the first time, I had heard of a “run” that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment lost in the retelling of the old story.
Why should independent Scotland even obey Europe’s orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: a major post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the Eurocrisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties against the EU or the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party “Alternative for Germany” — founded only this year — appeared out of nowhere and received nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing the Free Democrats (the same as our Liberal Democrats) out of Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the federal Europe plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the bonds imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are working in excessive budget deficits — that was just for Greece alone.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members from exchange rates that benefit German exporters — that German policies and want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a pre-conceived position in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut wages and public spending, which Berlin actively supports.
The current problems of the budget and currency pose a deeper challenge to Europe ' s productive capacities.
As a result of the green energy package introduced by Brussels, a code that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
It's a paralyzing unfavourable price environment, as we've already seen in Granjmut.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the devastating defeat of the cheap US shale gas over the European petroleum industry.
As a result, a rebellion is raging, especially in France, once the EU's most prominent defender.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way of controlling Germany and putting Paris at the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the devastated economy of France in distress.
The result is a right against the EU party, Marin Le Pen, the National Front, has just won a decisive additional election, dropping the ruling socialist party to the third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote — a timely warning to British Labourers that it cannot be assumed that the right-wing split will automatically affect the left-hand side.
What does Le Penn do with his new-born popularity in the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to establish a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If — and this is very likely — parties against the EU will receive support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: the rapidly growing sentiments against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are being consolidated to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become a kind of vague European (supervised) nation, which General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several economies dependent on it can preserve the euro, but France and southern Europe are recovering their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is moving away from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be unattended in the cold Atlantic.
In what way does Scotland leave this?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will succeed in a more free European arrangement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party Government in Scotland is, as no wonder, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority in 2011 due to objections to the reductions in expenditures proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and subsequently created by the coalition of the Torah and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now be foolish to vote in favour of independence only in order to take measures of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: aging early
African American and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturity is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the trigger mechanisms for early sexual maturation
The trend towards early sexual maturity is less pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family matters.
Should mothers be frightened if their daughters begin to develop breast - cell conceptions and grow lobe hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes were quite common among American girls and constituted a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — that doesn’t usually mean quick sexual maturity,” Kapplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, frontal and insinuation hair and body odors, appear before the girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in menarch age (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and fell from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years to menarch,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book Early Maternal Maturity of Girls: How to Cope With This Widespread Problem.
Time is the most accurate examination of how puberty will progress.
Discussions are under way on what constitutes the actual onset of sexual maturity but is considered “premature” when breast growth is accompanied by a sharp increase of up to 8 years.
In most cases the process will slow or slow down — that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression may be the basis for analysis by an endocrineologist in order to avoid serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to retain early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone ageing, which can eventually slow growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations on drug or hormone therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
He is careful with drugs, but admits that “the suppression of sexual maturity can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from teenagers”.
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy, or even how they deal with hygiene,” Kapplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-spoken theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys — as well as girls — have sexual maturity earlier.
Kaplovitz claims that the assumption that is the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which links fat to puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In the country, African American and Latin American girls tend to become sexually mature before their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Even more enigma: Although boys have hair on their face and forehead at a younger age, the tendency to fully early puberty is less pronounced than girls do.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even infants and children of jasper age may experience the appearance of the hair and the forehead.
“We should be careful about how we determine the true onset of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not shy away from receiving guidance from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“It could mean earlier than expected conversation,” explains Kapplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when they do so earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
Stuck in Cheetah by American Boeing preparing to take off
The Open Sky Treaty observation flight over the Russian territory and the unplanned landing in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 Moscow time, will leave the city's air harbor.
The airport authorities allowed the flight to take off when they got the fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan Wade.
According to other sources, he's going to the United States.
A plane flying to Ulaan Ude was reportedly landed in the Zabaikal region because of fog.
He was not released from Chita Airport due to unpaid accounts.
There are 30 people on board, including crew, and two nights on board at the airport, ITAR-TSS reported.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, air-shiped persons are not allowed to go beyond Chita Airport, they can only pass border control at two Russian airports in Cuba and Ulaan Ude.
The Open Sky Treaty was signed in 1992, involving 34 States.
Observation flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, promote monitoring of arms control agreements, enhance crisis prevention and crisis management within OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do late celebrities earn - MK in the U.S.
The rating of live celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But her deceased Michael Jackson, whose death income was 160 million between October 2012 and October 2013.
He is far behind the other celebrities who “earned” a few times last year.
Elvis Presley, 55 million a year later, was listed as the most “constant” of the missing celebrities, with 37 million under the cover of the Penuts Charles Schultz comic book.
In addition to the first five, Elizabeth Taylor, a leader (25 million) last year, and Bob Marley, a musician (18 million).
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein were also listed.
Igorya Gulyaeva's first boutique opened in Moscow
On 23 October, Igor Guljaev's first flagship bottle was opened in Moscow.
The designer Igor Gulyaev is famous for the wide public with his magnificent products made of luxury fur.
And now they can appreciate even more fashion worshipers -- in Moscow, his first boutique finally opened up, about which the designer and hosted a dolce-style party vita.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That is why I am especially glad that I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there really is a part of me.
It was with these words that Igor cut the red tape and invited all those who wanted to... to look at the models!
Manufacturers of jet planes are hostile to the width of the seat when orders are high
There was a heated dispute between the leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on the far voyages, setting a tone for fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats provided on the far-magazine voyages to economic-class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of the airline's attention, while the volume of space allocated to them plays a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would cover the width of a seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economic classrooms, but her main American competitor, Boeing, said it was up to airlines to decide.
The dispute is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sales of the increasingly large versions of their two-engine freeway aircraft and potentially record orders are expected at the 17-21 November event.
The rear-facing of the aircraft — especially if 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row — is central to the applications for the economic efficiency of the new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches in the width of 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people to the economy class in seats 18 inches wide, located 9 inches in rows.
Airplane giants often share technical shocks by advertising in the professional press.
Airbus is now turning directly to the public in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what might be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing the financiers a slide showing three people in a restaurant who were stuck with each other, entitled “Would you agree to that?”
“Boeing offers far-sighted flights on seats more narrow than on regional turbines,” said Airbus John Leahy, the manager of the sale.
With changes in diet, people gain weight, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when broadband Boeing 747 set standards for modern long journeys, the average American man aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The size of the 21st-century average male waist is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus argues that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average waist coverage of those recently referred to as “reactive public” has already been.
Airbus said it ordered a study showing that an additional inch in the width of the seat improved the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests the airbus numbers by the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in deciding how to find a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her research, the comfort of the living room depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It is all about providing airlines with choices and opportunities to do what they feel they should do to achieve success,” said the expert at the Kent Creaver salons.
They don't want us to decide for them what they'll get.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space by side, but for suppliers this is increasingly a factor that may affect profits.
The dispute is followed by a race for at least $700 billion in fixed prices over the coming decades for aircraft orders to change the ratio of US and European exports.
For the first time, as Reuters reported in July, the location of seats is precisely what warms competition in the battle between the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing have declared a 20 per cent increase in profitability per seat in their last two motor longway models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared Boeing characteristics are partly based on a comparison of the 10 series of 777X with the original 9-bed series of constructive decision 777.
Wins at a particular cost are decreasing compared to the 10-places currently used.
“The reason why Boeing does this is to press more seats and make his plane more competitive than we do with our design,” said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that lounges with full ten-seat lines for the existing 777ths indicate that many passengers prefer a dense dissipation, which can go hand in hand with lower fares.
“The seat width of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view the Airbus proposal is due to the threat posed by the 777th model,” said Mary Kirby's interior specialist, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling around the world, jet aircraft salesmen even carry roulettes with them to check out competing plans.
With its comfort, all manufacturers also offer airplanes with a very dense compartment for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10 rows, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had stressed the need for additional cabin modifications, offering more space for some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but may distract attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
A new anti-nicin vaccine may deprive the smoking process of satisfaction
Scientists have developed an anticancer vaccine that could deprive the smoking process of cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from the nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed prior to the start of human testing, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Wayll Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern tools,” said Professor Cornelius.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to produce a stable antibody stream.
Antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine blow.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that they didn't give the vaccine were relaxed, and that's the sign that nicotine got to their brain, says researchers.
These experiments are described in Science Translation Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain high levels of antibodies, the shots had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns the liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they want to try a cigarette to prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that she will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not be satisfied with the nicotine vaccine, and this can help them to get rid of the habit”, he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Olejnik: A third of the rural settlements of Podmozkowya are fully subsidized
Deputy Governor of Podmoskowya Yuri Olenikov stated that nearly one third of Moscow ' s rural settlements were fully subsidized
A total of 187 settlements from the region's budget are received out of 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenue of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent are subsidized.
Within the framework of the budget, some 25 billion rubles are allocated from the regional budget," said Olejnikov.
The Governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytiště, Odzovo and Pushkino - had a budget income of more than 1 billion roubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million roubles, which is “not enough”.
The cost of maintaining a local administrative unit in 88 settlements in Podmoskowya is over 70 per cent, while “the quality of services is lower”, said Olejnik.
He had previously instructed the heads of municipal entities of Podmozkowya to consider which settlements needed to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or to change the administration system.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Before that, the Governor of Moscow said that the administrative reform of Podmoskowya planned to reduce the number of rural subsidized settlements.
Also in Mojaysk, Kasher, Solnechnerski, Kolomensko oblasts, Ljubercs and Kotelniks there is a request for an increase in municipalities.
The discussion of this issue will begin in November in cities and regions of the region.
The President, Mr. Igor Brynzalov, also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 regions of Podmoskowya were planned to be grouped together within the forthcoming adreforms.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in Podmozkowya, less than one third have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 grants.
Diana Arbenin celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure she derives from raising her children.
Although Arbenina is now especially devoted to creativity and social activities, she still has the opportunity to go along with Martha and Artema, not only does she spend time teaching them, but she also entertains them as much as she can.
In the last week, Diana twice reported to her worshipers about her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she was talking to the fans, showing me how she put Artema and Martha on Halloween.
We're ready for the broom race! our first halloween" - that's what Diana called a picture of her children dressed in holiday suits.
That is unwise, for like any other Russian boys and girls, they are involved in this celebration because they were born in America.
Germany first introduces “unspecified sex” in the registration of children in Europe
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to register children born to Hermaphroditus instead of male or female, to indicate “undetermined”.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the gender in the unfilled birth certificate for a time.
For "F" (women's sex) or "M" (men's sex), parents can write "X" (unspecified).
This decision is intended to prevent parents from rushing into an “explanation” operation.
According to statistics, one out of 2,000 newborns in the world are born with a hermaphrodite.
Tripods deny that they are influenced by Obeby
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, will be the figure of an investigation into the anti-corruption oversight body of the state.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Jo Tripodi, denies changes in the lease arrangements for the seaside facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on State land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had lobbyed for several state ministers to extend leases to Serkular Kei, where the Obid family owned two restaurants and cafes, without going through the tender after the expiry of their term of office in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid ' s secret involvement in real estate facilities following testimony from the former Deputy Chief of Administration, Mr. Tridody Lynn Ashpoul, on Thursday.
During the several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease should be put on open competition.
The tenants were against this, as well as wanted longer leases.
In 2009, leases of enterprises to Serkullar Kei, which brought about $2.5 million per year to the Obajd family, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, originally advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, according to Mr. Triedi, urged the Government to change its lease policy.
The ICAC communication communication provided included conversations between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division, in August and September 2007.
“Was the issue discussed during these phone calls the question of the development of commercial lease policies?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willi, Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but that was definitely wrong.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
A senior administration official in Fox News interviewed confirmed that Israeli warplanes struck a target on Thursday evening in the Syrian port city of Latakiya.
The clerk did not specify what the purpose was, but said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the purpose of the rockets was to produce the Russian production SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried aircraft on cargoes with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of division 457 may be tested for “substance”
The test for foreign visa workers of Class 457 is under consideration by the Government because it suggests an increase in repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied according to the criteria for preventing the use of 457 visas to fill unqualified posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKew criticized the Government's rhetoric about foreign workers, he said that this could offend Australia's neighbours.
“Through statements like “foreigners at the end of the line” and “the work of the Australians” represent a very unpleasant departure from the times when trade unions demanded a secure labour market,” she told the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was the white work that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw the sound of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper before the discussion outlined 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials regarding human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are under consideration.
If the criteria for “subsidity” are adopted, the applicant for a visa may be examined for the purposes of “whether the candidate is a genuine candidate under the conditions of being a relative or a close acquaintance of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise”.
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of visa holders of division 457, since previously enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees were then employed by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died allegedly from a heart attack following his arrival on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s nine - year - old son, who was killed, had accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he had been supported by a cousin who was also aboard the ship.
The Australian authorities rushed the man to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A friend of Simeon Varlamova said that a hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov Evgenia Wavrinyuk said that he suffered from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking”, said, inter alia, a woman.
Recall that Vavrinyuk sued for beating up Semina Varlamov, who is also a member of the Kolorado Club.
She said that the hockey player pulled her by the hair, and beat her, after the attack, her hands, breast, abdomen and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athletes in the country's movements, but prohibited them from approaching Vavrinyuk.
He is also threatened with imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The British Government has announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, with the start of the First Step in 2026
Baroness Kramer, Minister of Transport, noted that the project “will unite Britain”.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Keith Brown, said that he was “in awe” of the prospect of working on a plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is engaged in negotiations with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and shorter travel time for North England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the route from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal on HS2 is to create a genuine national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a crisis of capacity in our railway network.
But it's also about urban transport; across Britain, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get a better message thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: “Today's announcement is good news for Scotland”.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called upon Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in HS2.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for a high-speed railway all over Britain”.
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, for the benefit of all and for the continuation of the Glasgow-Edinburg railway, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the following steps.
Tori is a new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on climate.
Renewable energy sources require a large space for generation.
The nuclear power is the same, but it leaves a lot of expensive waste in the waste disposal process.
Recently, scientists drew attention to the theory, another radioactive element of the Mendeleyev system.
It meets all over the world, and experts say that its fissure does not leave the waste that has to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices by aircraft in Australia remain in force for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to switch off their board and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures to soften US regulations relating to the devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed American carriers to change their procedures in such a way that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in flight mode.
Passengers can already do so during the main part of the flight, but many annoy that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required American airlines to undertake a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they were not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
In the Civil Aviation Safety Office, they also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were still in operation in Australia.
“Civil aviation safety management currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft”, she said.
This issue is regulated by rules requiring air carriers to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety rules notified to them by crew members.
The Virginia company, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office, the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not against change, but stated that it would follow the direction of the controller.
“We would like to welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Aviation Safety Office of the issue of e-authorization of electronic devices, because we really think it would improve customer service now that it is on our aircraft,” said the press secretary.
Qantas stated that the current rules would be followed.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change it soon,” she said.
The FAU regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly be careful to examine the FAU decision and the reasons behind it.
For US carriers, the impact of the regulation will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their planes are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, manuals and passenger instructions.
“After the airline verifys and confirms the stability of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tabletes, electronic books and smartphones at any altitude,” FAU said.
In rare cases, poor visibility of crews will give passengers instructions to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the recommendation of the group, the heavier devices shall be located under the seats or in the upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The heads of Dagestan are heard in Cuba's anthems of extremism
The football match between Anji and Cubanou became a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar province and Dagestan after the fans burned down the Dagestan flag, and the Kubani anthem sounded different.
President Dagestana Ramazan Abdulatipipi invited Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court on Thursday because the Krasnodar anthem of the Krasnodar province is allegedly calling for a cross-national difference, in particular, for a war with “basurmans”.
Take the hymn of the Krasnodar region, this is in our time in 1995 that the anthem was approved.
It's a disgrace, and no one's doing it.
"You are here to remember, as a mother of one's mother, as an enemy, as a basurmanin, we go to the death battle" - which is why we write such words into the anthem, and to poison some believers on other believers - expressed solidarity with Abdulatypov's President of the Parliament of Hizri Shihsaid.
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad
Now, the news is from the ocean, namely Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has struck Russian production rockets, which are said to have been targeted by Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition of destroying its chemical weapons by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia and which allowed the United States not to conduct the military operation to which they had come this summer.
More detailed on weapons and what all this means to the Syrian President will tell our leading international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for that.
Over 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August of toxic gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend Vladimir Putin made.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had removed the declared mills for the manufacture of weapons.
The longer-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
We understand that it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Assad's days were considered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when that will happen.
He's no longer legitimate and has to leave.
But Assad stays.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has avoided punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement was called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made an impression of a man who was ready to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the US Ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child starves, his mother is hardly easier than not being killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's holding on.
And he's turning his weapons into power.
President of RF established a separate Ministry of Construction and JCF
President Vladimir Putin of Russia created a new Ministry, which is responsible for building and JCF and proposed that he be headed by an ex- Governor of the Ivanov Region of Mikhail Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men in a residence in Novo Ogarjevo, and Menh did not refuse to head the new office.
Russian President Dmitry Peskov explained that all the functions relating to the construction and the JCS were transferred to the new ministry from the Minsk region.
Mikhail Menh, the son of the famous Orthodox priest Alexander Men, finished the Moscow Institute of Nephthem named Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began, he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergievo-Posada region, a deputy of the State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Menh was the Governor of the Ivanov Region.
The pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is having difficulties.
In a pawn shop at the Bendemir Trade Center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga lays a gold bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt is increasing — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its deal, became the third pawn shop registered at the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Credit for jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Singapore usually has an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above 15.4 per cent, proposed at the United Overseas Bank office, a local subsidiary creditor at the same trading centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require creditworthiness checks or proof of pay and can lend faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are turning to pawnshops because families feel pressured because of the cost of living and the rapid increase in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth followed by the global financial crisis and cheap loans fuelled by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in the family loan shoulder, mainly due to an increase in mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia headed the list from 80 per cent of GDP, compared with 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely recovered from the technical recession this week.
Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“The net is that, with prices rising, people in the middle and lower [the income scale] will be looking for ways to fill their income wherever they can,” says Song Sung Won, CIMB economist, a Malaysian bank.
In the past two years, high gold prices have increased the speed with which people place their personal belongings because they use the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items set up in 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold items.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put on the golden chain of grandma and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnbroker of EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the lombarous business is such that ValueMax, a branch operator in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, using 60 per cent of the S$66 million engaged this week as a result of the stockholding on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors sparked criticism at high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the pawnbroker did not only offer cheaper tariffs than other creditors, nor did it directly increase debt.
“Clients establish items they already own and the montization of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she said.
The bet is gaining more and more public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
In doing so, the pawnshops do not only use the categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices by setting gold stamps or Rolex watches, which can provide up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include self-employed persons who need to take money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments, or small business enterprises who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of health facilities available and their status that are important to the population but the quality of health care provided.
The “Modernization of Health in the Toul Region 2011-2013” programme, reorganizing our city’s medical institutions, will enable the establishment of an optimal structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological ill, pregnant and rosary.
Thus, following the merger with the gonorrhea, there was an even greater possibility of attracting narrow specialists from the NSAG to consult pregnant women with different pathologies, to conduct additional hospital-based surveys.
During the modernization programme, the logistics base of the maternity home was significantly improved, and modern equipment was developed that conforms to world standards.
Over the years, some 8 million roubles have been allocated for major maintenance of premises, 112 items of equipment worth 42 million roubles.
The most advanced equipment is an intensive post for newborns.
The operation of the caesarean section uses the Sell Seaver apparatus to collect blood from the surgical wound and to return the baby after special treatment, avoiding transfusions of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a clinic diagnostic unit.
An electronic registry is in place in women ' s consultations, and the introduction of electronic maps and patient history is planned in the near future.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, there was an opportunity to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, newborns and new births with regional specialists.
Chechens were beaten and robbed by 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechnya were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been conducted since March this year.
About 60 women complained of the actions of Caucasians.
The gang reportedly ordered prostitutes from one of Strasbourg’s hotels and then beaten and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old judge of Chechnya.
The Barwari defender David Alabama became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reports the official bundesliga website.
In this dispute, he outranked representatives of winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second seat was taken by the skier Marcel Hirschier, and the third by the jumper on the skis with the tramp Gregor Schlirentzauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian Filipino-Nigeriaian helped his team to win the League of Champions, the Championships and the Cup of Germany, as well as the UEFA SuperCube.
Arshawin's ex-wife rests with actor Andre Chadov
Andrey Arshawin Yulia Baranovska, a former civil wife of Peter Zenita football player, enjoys a vacation with actor Andre Chadov.
Julia rests in Italy for an actress named Anastasia Zakolery, her fiancé is a figureist, Sergei Slavova, and Andrea Chadova.
Photos of the joint walk couples were published in Instagram Anastasia Roadside.
This is not the first picture of Andrea and Julia.
On 5 October, the Highlands released a picture of a couple standing on the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Havbek Zenita Andrey Arshawin confessed to living apart from his civilian wife, Julia.
Recall that Julia Baranovsky and Andrey Arshawin had been together since 2003, and they had three children.
It's recently become known that Arshawin is dating Alice Kazmina's ex-model.
Arshawin's new friend was married to the top manager of the corporation.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's health
The Federal Government insists that a $325 million rescue package for a weakened Tasmanian health system will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste funds.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanja Plibersek, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “temporary measures” to prevent a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island State, a higher rate of chronic diseases and restrictions of the system.
The four-year funding decision was taken following consultations of the Government with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilki.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific problems facing the state”, said Ms. Plibersek today.
A $325 million package includes $31 million per flash campaign on scheduled operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract disposal operations, will help overcome the backlog.
There is also money for clinics that receive unrecorded patients in Hobart and Lonston to improve quality of care after the hospital, medical training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical maps in local hospitals.
“The investments will be based on the ideas expressed by the best doctors on how best to help Tasmania’s health system”, said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in strict accountability and accountability.
The State would need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive the money from the Commonwealth and to report monthly on where it spent the additional funds.
A three-man commission will be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not solve anything, “if they are not followed by a genuine reform that will put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis”.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his urgent request for assistance, which he first called on the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to the withdrawal of the state’s health system from critical conditions”, said Mr. Wilki.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures greatly offset recent reductions.
But Peter Dutton, federal health opposition representative, believes that today's statement is “a decision similar to that of a leuklasty”.
“The reason why we’re here is that the state’s Labour Government pulled $430 million out of the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
When the state government cuts almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million dollars, it cannot be pretended to be good news.
Mr. Datton asked Ms. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar in the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The engraving of Guillaume Nichom Niclu of the novel Danny Didro may boast exceptional performance and historical details, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark history of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to the convent of her family.
When she begins to rebel, she is extremely cruel from the hands of a sadistic governor and becomes the object of erotic fantasies to others.
The film never goes down until it's wrong or sensational — and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the report risks becoming a test like a weave and for the audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons equipment, the observation team said.
Syria destroyed major equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, declared on Thursday by an international observation team, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, not far from one of the sites where toxic substances were believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
the deadline of 1 November, established by this organization based in The Hague to destroy or “make incapacitate” all means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix chemicals with the production of toxic gas and to fill their ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious schedule, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria is no longer able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles is yet to begin.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve gas.
This statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in the town of Saphira, where experts believe the chemical weapons facility and its storage sites are located, reports the Syrian Centre for Human Rights, which is based in Britain.
A group of activists, who had been tracking losses through a network of activists in Syria, stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the Government, a group of 29,954 members are members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are pro-Government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2,202 army fugitives and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to a UN assessment of 25 July, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad forces fought in Safira for several weeks with rebels, many of which were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that Thursday there were victims on both sides but did not provide specific data.
The fighting stressed the danger faced by the chemical weapons inspectors, who were caught up in the short term of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that her team was “now satisfied that it had verified and saw all the critical means of production and equipment for mixing/refuelling claimed by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the Inspectors stated that they had completed their first round of verification by visiting 21 of the 23 facilities declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that both sites were, according to the Syrian declaration, “disposed and... items of the chemical weapons programme contained therein were transferred to other declared sites that had been verified”.
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the site had been one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors had not been able to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW executive committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that all of you have shown in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmet Umumju, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the third year, a civil war has plagued the rebels, mainly the Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, who are members of its alawite sect, the response of Shia Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of the Rami Abdurahman centre said that there was a massive explosion on Wednesday at the airfield site in Latakiya coastal province of Syria.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Angrily over the objection to the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The 202 survivors of the bombing in Bali in 2002 reacted bitterly to a sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators who had been brought before the court and claimed that Umar Patek should be shot.
The road, which spent nearly 10 years running as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for its role in the creation of explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he is granted parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacres as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular Kut tourist area, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist charges, including in the wake of church explosions throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person called a “response” for his reputation as an explosive master should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of Mother of Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Barely restraining her tears, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
He must face the firing squad, ” said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I have no grandchildren anymore, and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sarai Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was launched, which was placed in a parked van outside, immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack that was blown up by an explosive just 20 seconds earlier.
He then fell into a coma and died three times a month, being connected to a life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek must share the participation of three other members of the James Islami terrorist cell responsible for the bloodbath, Amrozzi, Muhlas and Imam Saszy, who had been executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone else.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not enough.
The path is the last of the terrorist in Bali to appear before the court.
He hid for nearly ten years, but was eventually detained in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad in January 2011, where American troops killed former commander of Al-Qaida Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent showed that intelligence evidence showed that the duck was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to reconnect South-East Asian and Al-Qaida terrorist groups.
“He did not surrender,” said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had no regrets at all about how much he had caused others.
Sentenced in advance of the 10th anniversary of the attack to be held later this year in Bali and Australia.
“This year, there will be many tears,” said Mrs. Cortin.
The path can still appeal its sentence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use airline boyfriends (but do not call from a mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Authority on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect change to happen immediately.
As this change is rapidly being implemented, it will vary depending on the airline, said FAU administrator Michael Worth at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for flight crew members and device lining rules in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that had already submitted plans.
“We could approve an increase in the use of electronic devices very soon depending on the state of the plan,” FAU said.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, boardboards and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain does not do well.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane drops to land and do not include them until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may permit passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and roll-off operations have declared to the FAU.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Boards, welcomed these developments.
“After the new policy is well implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a lossless option,” said Glading.
We are frankly tired of feeling "school duty" when it comes to the issue.
But the Internet connection for surfing, the exchange of e-mails, text messages or data download will still be prohibited at less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aircraft.
Thus, there are still no words with friends — the intellectual Internet game in which Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when the incident occurred: the actor was removed from the American Airlines airline for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was on landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still have to be placed in the baggage compartment, because they can traumatize someone if they fly around the hall.
Mobile phone calls in flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU, has regulatory powers on telephone calls.
FAU may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Council, a national expert on CBS News transport safety, stated that cellular phones were still considered a risk.
“Common phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but we know through the FCS that they can interfere with higher cellular connections when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by FAU to study this issue had recommended last month that the Government should allow for the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on FAUs to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as the Democrat Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, claim that there are no compelling security reasons for prohibitions.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the application of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn their devices off.
FAU began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966, in response to reports of disturbances for navigational and communications equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers, high-tech boyfriends at the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Vehicles modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners have been adapted for the wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Werta said.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal signals when browsing pages.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com was among those who sought to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded a whole airliner with their electronic reading devices, Kindle, and flew on it to check that there were problems, but they never found them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices represented any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Passengers' Association stated that he considered the interference from devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only separate reports from pilots confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of these communications were very old.
Nevertheless, the Committee recommended that the FAU allow the pilots to require passengers to switch off devices during instrument landings in restricted visibility.
The team of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes by calling them a prudent step towards the passengers who are now using many technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Doe, Director-General of the US Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to conduct driving tests.
Driving tickets will be able to accommodate private companies with their own computerised autodrome.
Kommersant writes about this, referring to a draft decision by the Government on the approval to drive vehicles.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such highways in Russia.
The students of such "privileged" cars are expected to count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Inspectorate will monitor the passing of the examinations every six months.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical examinations and more than 20 per cent of the platform are not passed on for the first time, the school will be denied the privilege of six months.
The technical requirements for motor vehicles contained in the draft Government Regulation shall enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also includes training requirements for two-wheel drive.
Since 1 January 2015, riders of motorcycles will be required to pass an examination in urban conditions in order to obtain category A rights.
In addition, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such employees will be entitled to Russian rights upon examination.
Birds carried by air to a safe place from a drilling facility in the North Sea released back into the wild
The bird that was carried by air to the shore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter headed to Aberdin last month and then went to the Scottish Animal Abuse Prevention Society (SPCA) office at the Rescue Centre in Alloa.
The manager of the Colin Siddon Center said: “The water-fowl is probably a North European winter migrant who has reached the zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
Looks like the bird hung up and was able to find shelter on an oil rig.
He added, "She was unable to take off again, so they turned to us for help."
Water shepherds were healthy and in good condition by the time they released him.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to gather business representatives and determine what changes British welfare and job creators want to see in their relations with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of business cuts in Britain in size, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the survey will be surprising for many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities beyond Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the Government to prioritise new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on a long and difficult process of reforming EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in the trade zone of Europe, which even 40 per cent of large enterprises traditionally most pro-European of all companies agreed to do so.
The most recent and most effective survey of business leaders revealed that the obvious majority wanted Britain to pursue a course on treaty change and relations with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which has been seen among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a “significant change” that will restore power back to Britain.
High rates — achieving treaty changes and more favourable conditions for Britain will ensure a 16 per cent shift in vote for staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister must have no doubt: the survey shows that the British business supports his plan to review the conditions for British membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the British side.
The best conditions for British business are possible and becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain and, as the results of our survey show, to business, this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' normative activities.
U.S. staff are listening to the Pope's personal phone.
The work of the Vatican is under the watchful control of the United States Special Services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that the U.S. Intelligence has been listening to all of the previous Pope Benedict's negotiations, and is now closely guarding Pope Francis.
His phone started listening before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was also monitored.

A snowboarder for the Olympic Cup photographed specifically
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative note to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held in winter.
The denomination is 100 roubles.
But bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative note.
After the presentation of the Olympic Cup on 30 October, they drew attention to the fact that a snowboarder’s image from the bills could be found in the photobanks.
In particular, the StockExchange photo storage facility, where the photograph was dated in 2005.
The same photo is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobzor on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in RugGear smartphone advertising.
The Olympic banknote was executed in blue and blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flying over the Sochi, on the other, is a species of Olympic stadium and Jar-Bird.
Design of a note by Pavel Boushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts called Repina.
The presentation noted that several types of sports were considered, such as mining, fristal and tramping, but eventually selected a snowboard because it was a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the CB, the regulator is not indifferent to the public's view of the wide dissemination of the snowboarder's image from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
Here in Hoznak, they're not too worried about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service, Hossnak Natalya Nikiforova, stated "Awake," that all the reasoning on the plagiarism was ridiculous.
A snowboarder on the bank notes turned right, in a web photo - left, specified by Nikiforova.
The person at the photo shoot was taken from different points, and then the final image was selected, and he's a typical outside snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic banknote because the artist had paid for his work.
According to experts, the discussion about the image at the Olympic Cup is positive.
Recognisability of the image at the counter - plus for its progress - is considered by the executive director of the PN “RusBrand” Alexei Popovicev.
It is difficult to prove the 100 per cent similarity of the images in the voucher and in the photobanks, so it is unlikely that the claims for intellectual property will be brought against the image.
The Olympic banknote first appeared in China, the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 and was released a commemorative note in 10 Yuan.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
The legislative prohibitions forced the Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
They say that the consumption of beer in the country will remain at the same level next year, at best.
Although businessmen were initially counting on growth.
In fact, the current year has been a bad year for them, with sales falling by 7 per cent.
Both of these were the head of one of the country's largest brewers, President of the Russian brewers' board, Isaac Sheps, at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute on everyday demand in Russia, which had just ended in Moscow.
It discussed public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already fallen by 18 per cent, as in recent years there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in the production and trafficking of beer, a small alcoholic beverage, Sheps reported.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unforeseeable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions that are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
Pivovar noted that many legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse were not particularly influential, but that new initiatives were constantly emerging.
The ban on selling beer in kiosks that has been imposed since this year has struck the pain of all beer producers.
"We immediately lost 35,000 users," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, the brewers have two predictions.
The optimist is the one Sheps spoke of: the sale of the foam drink will remain at the same level.
The pessimistic will fall by another 2-3 per cent.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen have to leave the classes intended for the mass consumer to the premium class: beer will become less, but it will cost more.
However, there is no evidence of a radical effect on the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol.
"I believe the level of alcoholism remains about the same level, according to a doctor named Alexey Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of sick people using strong drink surrogates has increased, as have those who “stuck up” on alcohol-containing tonics like Jaguar, while ten years ago was dominated by “beverage ” alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford Motors plant in Węwołożsk.
As the trade unions have said, all dismissed have received compensation.
However, where the problems of workers are more severe than those of workers, the question of reducing the production in the region is raised.
ZakSa District Attorney Alexei Ethmanov stated at the meeting that about 600 people had been reduced at the Ford factory in Węwołożsk.
He said that this had happened in September: then about 600 people left the factory for the voluntary dismissal programme, which had been developed with the trade union.
The workers who decided to resign were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the overwhelming majority have left jobs of their own volition.
According to Ethmanov, however, this number of people is a night shift.
I don't think that's going to be a problem.
In the next two years, however, the authorities did not plan to adopt any programmes to support regional enterprises in difficulty”, he explained, adding that in adopting the budget, the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
This information is not denied or confirmed at the Ford.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as it comes, we'll have to publish it.
Talks about cutting down workers at the Ford factory in Wławożsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, 600 people were informed about plans to fire the company in September.
The plant had previously declared the production of cars to be suspended.
The factory was called the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, after nine months in 2013, the production volume in Lenoblast decreased by 5.4 per cent.
Vehicle and equipment production decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile aircraft would be available during take-off and landing
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of the airline are approved in the United States, according to BBC.
United States airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new rules are expected to become operational by the end of 2013.
However, Internet access to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Because of the risk of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be prohibited.
Thus, passengers are allowed to read electronic books, play board games and other boyfriends, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before regulations are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, according to the United States, the current rules on the use of electronic devices in flights may also be revised in Britain.
A new name for the "Russian mob" in the United States has finally been added - "Bratsky Circle"
This week, the black list of the Russian Mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli.
One Russian singer, Gregory Lepps, who was suspected by the United States of transporting money to members of the group, was a well - known singer.
However, in the United States blacklist, 22 people involved in the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts doubt that such an organization exists.
"The 'Brother circle' statement is more of an attempt to unify divergent criminal groups" -- said an expert on organized crime and Professor Mark Galeotti of the University of New York.
In his view, “Bratsky Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian mob”.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization”, quotes Mr. Galeotti, U.S. Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti also agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shelley.
“If they work together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization”, said the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Brethren Circle unites more closely the Russian thief in the Law of Aslan Ussoyan, known as Dead Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
For example, Lashi Shushanashvili and Zakharija Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely associated with Grandpa Hassan, and another participant on the list, Temuri Mirzoev, came to Grandpa Hassan as a nephew.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti pointed out that some individuals did not have a relationship with Usoyan.
In his view, they were all more united by general financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, a scandal surrounding the inclusion of Gregory Leps, Russian President Vladimir Putin's favorite singer, in the Brethren Circle, has caught the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we hope that we will receive more detailed information from our American partners, and that this decision has been made, why it has been made on such lists, said the Spokesman of the Head of State, Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is an RF citizen.
As well as the interests of all RF citizens, their interests will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The start of the Southern Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Head Gazprom.
“This year’s sign - the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” said President Gazprom Alexey Miller in his statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract dispute between Gazprom and his partners in Ukraine, which has a large part of the Russian gas destined for Europe, increases the risk for normal routes, officials say.
Miller stated that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive the South Stream gas at a reduced price as soon as the whole project starts in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should begin in other countries on the pipeline path by the end of the year.
The annual pipeline project capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Saratsk district, the Peugeot driver drove on the 115-km stretch of the Odessa-Reni route and encountered a six-man bus.

Two YMCA officers are charged with sexual crimes before charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has become aware.
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual offences against children prior to the indictment in 2011 against the child care agency in Karingbakh, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the Commission's opening statement stated that it had “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philippe Hayre, asked about one case where an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography crimes and another case where an YMCA sports instructor at Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayre told Gail Fernès, a lawyer helping the commission, that he knew about the first case, but didn't know about the second one.
He acknowledged that YMCA, in its opening speech to the Commission, had also made it imprecise, arguing that “there were external checks by YMCA which acknowledged that YMCA was at the forefront in ensuring the safety of children”.
The evidence provided by the commissions indicates that YMCA was informed that it had received the second of the four possible quality audits conducted by the Department of Education and Communities since the end of August this year.
Mr. Hayre, who entered YMCA at the age of 21, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed to hire Lord and had failed to provide a clear understanding of their obligations to report violations of children ' s security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord had been convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys for two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayre rejected the assumption that YMCA corporate ethics had prevented staff from reporting violations of the Lord in children ' s security.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the leadership of the Lord and asked to be trained to protect her children because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she had found Jackie Barnat, the child custody manager of YMCA in Caringbach, who was the leader of the Lord, “very frightening and often difficult to access”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept staff explanations that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their superior managers.
Rather, he said that their friendship with Lord had led them away from thinking about the need to report him.
Mr. Hayre said that he had submitted his opinion to the YMCA Council of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization of the “an incident with Jonathan Lord” was not “regarding the provision of information” by staff members, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hayre stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the charges were made was made by the Director-General of YMCA in charge of children, Liam Witley.
He said that it was meant to prevent the loss of evidence, but “resented” and failed to implement the decision.
YMCA of New South Wales was not safe for children during Jonathan Lord's work during the period 2009-2011, reported to the Commission expert on child growth, Professor Steven Smolbone of the University of Griffith.
He said there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, selection, instruction, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearings were postponed until 20 December.
Fashion week in São Paulo.
She's a family member, not just a model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bundschen had for some time left work, she had been distracted by motherhood, during these days, and this week she had arrived on special occasions.
The months of absence did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the highest-paid supermodel of the world.
This time she took part in the Kolchchi defile.
The fashion week is usually the most interesting show.
It's like he set up a stylist named Lino Willaventure.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of a pre-port of the luxury class, the model works actively in the theatre and in the cinema, performing performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies related to the textile industry and the fashion world participated in the final fashion week in São Paulo.

Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the opportunity to return as Prime Minister of Britain, but acknowledged that return was unlikely.
On the eve of an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as leader, Blair has avoided much of British policy discussion, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of the Middle East Peacekeepers.
Replying to the question of whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister Blair, according to London Evening Standard, he said: “Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ...”

The specialist also noted that a series of leading players' injuries were responsible for startup failures.
I'm sorry we didn't win, but Tmw says Allegry.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let Lacio do anything.
In the second Romans, they added, but in general, I can't say that we've lost our concentration.
I had to win.
Last season, we did the task of getting to the League of Champions.
We are now lagging behind, but this is due to a series of injuries from key football players.
Rami and Honda?
These are very good players, with character.
But our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who had a high-level meeting.
The experts from the con-portive activities that took place in Cardiff to fight for the Bad Year prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready to show up for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier who had taken his first steps, this young man and his petite Shetland pony Toffy snagged three rounds to take the main prize easily, leaving 30 adult rivals behind.
This inseparable pair — the same growth — was commended for the appearance, behaviour and style of the annual competition held by the Sannibank Horse Sports Center in Radry, not far from Cardiff.
Having taken a common view of men and women in fancy hats, he turned his cap into a proud two-year-old Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his well - developed ability to handle horses for years and years.
And Toffee got the highest grade for his appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffy on his third birthday in March of last year, and since then he's been dealing with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffy make a beautiful duet."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second talk with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
The uncharted people in the arena considered him to be so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Ebb Weil in South Wales, walks up the steps of his aunt Sharon Howeles, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “All the audience was shocked, and everyone screamed admiring shouts and wailed.”
He ran on sand all over the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is mindless — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Based on how he began, he will soon be participating in the “Loshady of the Year” — and I am sure that he will do well.
The representative of the annual horse show said: “The Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy as their appearance and how they presented themselves in the show-ring.
They evaluate the coherence of the performance of the pony and the breeder, Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was good at his attractive outfit, and he was really good at his role.
The Chinese newspaper's public appeal "to be restructured"
The Chinese newspaper, which issued the first-line call for the release of the accused in a slanderous reporter, must be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The New Express newspaper, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of a journalist, Chen Junzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles on a public property company.
The “New Express” must now be “a process of correcting errors”, according to the controller.
The order for “correction of errors” came from the Guandun Office in the areas of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
Preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group of the New Express newspaper published several false reports on the Zoomlion stock exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The “New Express Manual” was disorientated,” says the regulator's statement.
He reports that it has been decided to “lay the administrative penalty against Chen Junzhou in the form of a withdrawal of his reporter's license”.
He also “commanded Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation of newspaper officials and immediately amend the management of the New Express”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the “New Express” in which he stated that he had committed financial violations in a construction company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two appeals for his release on the first line, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television with recognition that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the news media industry and its ability to earn public confidence,” he said to the CCTV public broadcaster.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express issued an apology on the first lane, stating that the newspaper had failed to verify his reports properly.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects admitted on television.
Experts say that the practice of beating confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from coercing anyone into self-expression.
U.S. Tunnel — Mexico for drug trafficking equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, has been found.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel as four feet wide as one of the most complex secret moves ever discovered by them.
This tunnel, with zigzags of almost six football fields long, links warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with insignificant warehouses, facilitating the covert loading of narcotics into trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before any drugs had been smuggled invisibly through it, as the authorities said.
According to judicial documents, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine while detecting a tunnel.
Three men, who were law enforcement officials, were charged with keeping marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
They are sentenced to 10 years ' imprisonment to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major tunnel discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels have been discovered in Central Mexico since the crop harvest of marijuana in October, which placed before drug cartels the difficult task of delivering their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards long, equipped with track roads, which ranged from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to the two warehouses of San Diego.
Pensions in Belarus have increased since November
Since November this year, pensions have increased, and BELT has been reported to correspondent in the main management of the pension service of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
Since 1 November of this year, adjustments will be made to the average wage of workers in the Republic applied at the time of the previous recalculation of pensions, with an increase of 5.4 per cent and a corresponding recalculation of employment pensions in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on pension increases.
Recalculations from November will result in an estimated 5.3 per cent increase in employment pensions by age.
The average old-age pension would be Br2 million 295,000.
Pension increases amount to 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus will increase its pension costs at a monthly rate of Br274.3 billion from November this year.
At the same time as the recalculation of work pensions in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and pensions will be recalculated as the average per capita subsistence budget increases.
BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of BR1 million 530 to 2.1 per cent higher than that in force from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, 2.1 per cent will be increased by minimum employment pensions, social pensions and allowances, promotions and pension allowances as of 1 November.
In Belarus, more Br53 trillion-0-Tables have been set up for pension payments, taking into account increases in 2013
British Police are handing Assanju extradition notice
The British police today issued a notice of the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assangj, who hid at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had handed over to a 40-year-old Australian “official request to surrender” requiring him to appear at the police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would be further arrested.
Assanjo is at risk of extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his capacity under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, on 19 June, he hid in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, asking for political asylum from the South American country.
Scotland Yard “introduced to a 40-year-old man a formal request to surrender, which obliges him to come to the police station day and time of our choice”, said the press secretary.
He continues to violate bail terms.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of a notice to the police.
Assangge fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible espionage charges following the publication of over 250,000 U.S. diplomatic dispatches on the top-secret WikiLeaks website.
Driver travelling at 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined at £1000
The driver was fined £1000 for speed driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between the legs.
Thirty-five-year-old Andrew Howie from Tiptry, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 track in Braintry on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry between his legs.
In the world court, Colchester Howie admitted to being charged with driving without due diligence or attention.
The addition to his driving licence of seven penalty points resulted in him receiving a six-month driving ban.
Howie also committed to paying the costs of £90 and an additional fee to assist victims of crime of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to burst
Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborn, who introduced a 7 per cent duty rate in the 2012 budget for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in company rather than as individuals.
To date, the housing estate in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas, amounting to £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, has already exceeded the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Hamburg combined.
Mr. Cook stated: “After the increase in the hospitality to expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against evasion, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is low regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system”.
“But this step could lead to some foreign investors reluctantly buying real estate in London or its current owners refusing to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate — the top 5-10 per cent of the housing market — in the rich south-west London belt, extending from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by record 11.8 per cent over the past year.
According to a survey by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady increase of 5.6% in annual estimates, but were suppressed by an active domestic market with a surge in prices in the south-west, in the north (7.4%) and in the east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists shed light on the movement of the dog's tail to its mood.
Early studies showed that happy dogs pour their tails on the right side (from a dog's point of view), while alarmed dogs wave their tail mainly on the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can see these delicate tailing differences and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in the formation of inducers that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at it from other species.
He added that just like a person, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs reacted to the variety of tailings of other dogs, researchers observed animals watching films about other dogs.
They measured the rate of the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
Perhaps we will soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs video, either naturalistic versions, or silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we have been able to manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw that the rest of the unexpressing dog was moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning mainly to the left (from the point of view of the tail of the dog), their heartbeat was increasing and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he feels that the dogs have learned from their experience, which movements they should worry about, and which ones they do not.
He observed: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often their tails are linked to more friendly behaviour, and the right side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog responds on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a better understanding of the emotions of their animals.
An expert in dog conduct, John Bradshaw, an invited researcher at the Bristol University Veterinary School, said that it was not the first study to check whether the left and right sides were relevant to dogs.
Last year a group of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left if they were looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if they were looking at a happy dog.
In another scientific work at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “The Sobaki were more likely to approach a robot dog when the tail was thrown to the left, not to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite of the Italian study”.
He said that differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence from various mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are being used for various purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and the dogs are not excluded,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will likely soon understand why their tails are sometimes headed one way or the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after her vocalist had diagnosed laryngitis.
This boss band was supposed to be on the town's Hydro Concert Course on Friday.
However, Alex Turner’s condition caused them to carry the show.
This statement was made by the group after it was forced to postpone the same concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website Arctic Monkeys reported: “After a decision to transfer the show to Birmingham's LG Arena this evening and after seeking medical assistance, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show at the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November”.
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with “laringit”, and unfortunately he is unable to speak.”
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, and the show in Glasgow on Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All the tickets to this show are still valid.
We want to apologize to all the ticket owners for any inconvenience they may have caused.
For any additional assistance, please contact the Service Department of the Ticket Customers in which you purchased the tickets.
Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will bring the new cardinals of the Catholic Church into custody for the first time in his service on 22 February, according to the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they choose the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the cardinal age of 80, he could no longer participate in the election of the pope — the prerogative of the group of 120 “cardinal voters”.
In announcing this news, Vatican Spokesman Federico Lombardy said that all the current cardinals known as the Consistory would be held before the erection ceremony.
“Pa Francisk decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consortium in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from various parts of the world,” Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Votes said that by February, the number of cardinal voters is likely to decline.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it is necessary to bring the number of elected cardinals back to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over 80 years of age or older, as he wishes.
The consortium will be of great importance next year, because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, according to Valero.
So far, there is some bias in favour of Europe, and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he noted.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first elected cardinals since the formation of the French Cardinals Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who are tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope made his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was “probably possible” that Francisco would appeal to cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in such a situation before — all of this for the first time.
Valero said that the popes usually took up the post of Cardinal Bishops of Great Revenue, but Francis “half surprises — so we do not know who he will call.”
GM responds to a number of new U.S. pickups to complete seat backs
General Motors Co rescinds almost 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 models to address problems with manual control of seat backs, according to a notice from U.S. authorities on Friday in the area of road safety.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the back tilting mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards on head restraints.
“The head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury”, says a website of the National Road Traffic Safety Authority.
The models withdrawn were manufactured from 1 August to 10 September.
The release of GM pickups began in June and is the most important launch of the car in serial production for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of picapo about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider notifying owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which had reduced the increase in car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, grew by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, according to GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM stock at the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday to $37.47.
Obama voters' despair cry
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the obstruction of the republicans to undermine their commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with Obama's health system web site, drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second student at Harvard University Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in the time of disheartening in my second year of medical school and give me a feeling of hope.
It's called the Victory Tree, and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I end up writing reports about my patients in the evening and lying down in bed, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people, and statements could take the spirit.
The victory in the elections was impressive, and leading news programmes took a break to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
The White House was to be visited by a young team of strategists, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama ' s entry into office in 2008, its support level was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a rude wake-up call, like the withdrawal of a dream.
It is difficult to recall those days of optimism — they seem to be a long - range memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I dropped my first ballot paper, things have really changed.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on accessible medical care until the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the lifting of the “Don't ask, don't speak” rule, the killing of Usama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and the closure of the Guantánamo base among others.
But after countless times, when I was on Obama's side of the administration, protecting her from colleagues and peers, I have finished explaining what I can provide.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The obstruction of the Republicans cannot explain the permit to listen to foreign leaders or strike innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on American private life by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of public disclosures revealing the unlawful actions of the Government.
He cannot explain the killing of an American citizen, Anwar Al-Avlaki, without trial and investigation or failure to comply with the limits of State funding and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration”.
In recent times, it cannot justify the fact that it has failed to develop a simple website for more than three years following the signing of the law on accessible medical care.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Was I supposed to realize at the age of 18 that leadership could contradict the political campaigns that preceded him?
It is clear that election work is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and by random events such as the scourge of Newton.
Nevertheless, all the examples I cited above show that they were to a large extent their own choice of administration.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and harsh alternative, and it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that, in its second term, Obama, freeing himself from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped below 45 per cent this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 through the book.
This makes me yearn for many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton beat Obama deafly in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a failure analysis meeting, he told his staff that they had to return to normal and remain faithful to their goals.
“I want us to return our attraction,” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that the MP Tony Ebbot has a conflict of interest in the issue of child-care leave.
Deputy billionaire-milaire Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Ebbot had a conflict of interest in child-care leave because his daughters could become pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining mine, which has an unresolved carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement at a time when he tried to get away with the question of whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer Joint Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding to abolish carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be held by ministers, and said that Mr. Ebbot's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid child-care leave, because if any of these daughters become pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will receive a leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the fight for the seat of the Sanchein Kost Ferfax constituency, with 53 votes higher after the recalculation.
Mr. Palmer called for the revision of the electoral counting procedure to accelerate the process.
Daughters Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should the elections be decided two months after we voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system that we can come up with, put our data into the computer, vote it out, and get the result at 6:30 in the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of carnal notes in ballots.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use quarantine in our time.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sanchein Kost and would be “very serious” about his new work.
Public office involves the service of society.
“We are not making any prizes but thanking history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS removes two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders in its currency unit, according to the two people familiar with the situation, which further confirms that the global verification by regulators of alleged currency market manipulation is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the world's largest financial market, whose daily turnover is $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS personnel to be removed from the ongoing investigation, which coincides with the LIBOR interbank manipulation scandal.
By refusing to comment on the suspensions, the Bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation of this issue continues, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and our other regulators”, reported to the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said that RBS had transmitted the e-mail and instantaneous messages received and sent it to the former British Regulatory Authority, the Financial Activity Control Office (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave to head the European spot exchange market in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot markets in Citi, left on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
The instantaneous contact group of Mr. Asher included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
UBS reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said he was investigating alleged currency market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators worldwide — the European Commission, Finma, the antimonopoly body of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the United States Department of Justice and the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong — are considering claims that bankers have entered into a conspiracy to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, persons familiar with the situation.
Banks are looking at instant communications and e-mails over several years in search of cases of offences.
The news of the verifications has generated traders in activities that have been one of the largest sources of income for commercial units of investment banks in recent years, which this year, however, has encountered difficulties owing to the fact that low volatility of currencies has reduced favourable opportunities for repurchasers.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation by saying that a large and high-liquid currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the enormous volume of daily trading in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can start to influence the market for a very small price”.
This news came the same day when Credit Suisse announced that he had fired one of the traders in his London Stock Exchange trade department this week after he had lost nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue has managed to locate it,” said Credit Suisse.
Supreme Court upheld Obama ' s Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's health mark law was constitutional, which was a major victory for Obama's administration.
By voting 5 to 4, the judges decided that individual orders under the patient protection law and accessible health care requiring citizens to acquire medical insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the Government ' s tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, had joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also left the remaining sections of this 2700-page law in force and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Act to make the states more compliant with the Medicaid programme, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutional.
The bill was blocked by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed to each of the main Republican candidates for Presidents during the 2012 season of the 2012 primary elections, including the supposed candidate Mitt Romni.
Soccer's the cause of the roses?
In Gosdum, in the framework of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts discussed how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the suggestions was to ban football in the North Caucasus, because this game is one of scandals and discords.
Spiker Sergei Narishkin recalled recent developments in Birulev and said that to reduce the “city of tension in society” policies and media should be adjusted in terms of speech.
He must have meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinowski, who in one of the broadcasts threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they did not want to limit fertility...
All speakers also spoke of measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries and measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave the debate a lot of seismicity.
Maksim Grigoriev stated that the events in Birülev, “a model conflict that could be predicted”, but “we have too many people and authorities responsible for these issues” and seven children without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which has long been practiced by Europe against migrants, according to the public, has failed and must be pursued.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new single history textbook.
“The history of the culture of the people of the country must also be established so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that people live in Dagestan and vice versa”, he said.
Gennady Züganov proposed to criminalize the "calls for dismemberment of Russia": "If the US says on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and jailed for 20 years!"
Vladimir Girinowski tried very hard not to "fire."
As usual, he accused journalists of bringing ill and acute national problems to a public debate all over the world: “There is little to say in the dust of controversy!”
Vladimir Vasilev, the leader of the “One Russia” faction, also advised journalists to conclude a “paper” and agree to have a thorough discussion on the subject, and then the same obligations can be assumed by politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration and the order is generally established, Mr. Vasilev.
He cited as an example a law that places regional and municipal authorities responsible for the international world in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko was not impressed by this law: it does not share "explained that it is an adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and limits.
So the subjects will be treated in different ways.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the staff required to deal with such complex issues, and the methodical recommendations that they could use do not give them the Centre...
The Head of the National Affairs Committee, Gajímet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the threatening title “Ministry of National Security” to deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who was headed by a similar agency in the 1990s, subsequently abolished, objected.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, “a minister without a portfolio”, to whom you could address, if anything.
“We are going to the edge, the shells are coming together, it is very important for the representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to act together against provocations, and this work must receive decent information support”, said the representative of the RCC on the relations with the Wavlov Chaplin society.
There should be no neutrality on the part of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religion, in his view.
Here Oleg Nilov led the discussion into an unexpected direction: “The more talented people, than in Chechnya or Dagestan, are still to be sought, but they are not pushed into the wrong way, the wrong way," he said.
"Not that way" is the development of football: "The football player beats the whole crowd, the flags are burning, the comrades are throwing stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another kind of sport called regby...
"They will have no equal in the world in this form of sport!" said the truthful.
There's no play in the reggae on the Caucasus! Mr. Girinowski has just been involved.
You'll be offering them a steering wheel!
We need to know the national features, it's like offering the burden of a "Container"...
In Jaroslavla, wild behaviour on the rostrum was distinguished by the representatives of the Moscow Club - during the game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the RFS disciplinary committee, Arthur Grigoryantz, reported that Cuban was fined by 500,000 rubles, transferred from the House of Football correspondent S.E. Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Red-Normal Club have been imposed for the fire of Dagestan flag by fans on the rostrum during the 14th round of domestic football against Ange.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the PFC.
We've been researching all available materials.
For the illegal behaviour of the Cuban viewers, 500,000 roubles have been fined.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei claims against Nortel patents
The Group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed Thursday a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, whose price it had exceeded at Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed claims for patent violations in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match key words of search on the Internet with their advertisements, says the claim that Google is the foundation of search business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar representatives were not available and were not commenting.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce Android operating system phones from Google, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has several times increased the price offered, eventually offering a whole $4.4 billion.
After losing the patents of Nortel Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this transaction the patent library of Motorola was part of the determining factor.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt to acquire patents at the auction that are subject to the claim, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” says the lawsuit.
Rockstar requires increased compensation for losses from Google because he claims that Google's patent violation is intentional, according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President takes an oath
Muhammad Murcy takes an oath, but his day of celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAIST Mohammed Murcy promised “new Egypt” when he took the oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country to replace Hosni Mubarak, who had been overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Murcy also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath to 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are seeking a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Murcy said during a solemn ceremony on State television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability”, said Murcy, a 60-year-old American engineer with an education from the Brother Muslim, a fundamentalist group that was largely out of 84 years of existence a banned organization that served as a target for hard action by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarded when Murcy arrived with a small courtship shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new President, and unlike the President's pump of Mubarak's time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on the usual lively road connecting the city's center to the southern suburbs.
Although Murcy was mocked as a non-harrismistic spare wheel by the brothers, his personal prestige grew dramatically since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only as Islamist but also as all those who wanted to bring the 2011 rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak to the end.
“Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State”, said Murcy, wearing a blue business costume with a red tie, judges in the round of the wooden panels of the hall where he took an oath.
Later, Murcy went to Cairo University, where he was to give his inauguration speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that performed a public anthem, during which he stood at the “peaceful” stand.
There was a military officer named Feldmarschal Hussein Tantavi.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Armia and People — One Hand”, which scandalized hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the University.
Founded in 1908 as a dam of secular education, the University of Cairo in the 1970s became the backbone of Islamic student groups.
Murcy took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where the rebellion that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule ended last year, and promised to regain the authority of the President, who was deprived of his office by the military council, who took matters away from the overthrown leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, and not before Parliament, as adopted, he is doing the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Murcy's name on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Tümen Region Engineers Association was held at the Yalutorov Motor Plant.
As part of the event, a new line was presented for the production of electric power pipes from steel.
According to business director Dennis Gribanov, a marketing study was conducted in 2011 to study the market for steel constructions in the Tümen Region.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric power pipes per month.
It was then decided to change the factory profile and to install equipment for its production.
Already this year more than 7,000 tons of produce have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to over 120 million rub-les, says Dennis Gribanov.
In October, a new status was launched, allowing for an increase in the range.
The factory produces both a small pipe profile, which is used for tepe-personal, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
It is planned to produce 50,000 tons of products per year, representing about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen Region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of staff in the enterprise has not decreased - it now stands at 157, and in plans for the purchase of new equipment, an increase of more than 50 staff.
The company is retraining and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
The next year, it is planned to introduce a new longitudinal cutting unit with a thickness of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the cost of the products, as well as another state, at a rate of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, pipelines used in housing and communicative activities are expected to be released at the plant.
The management of the enterprise has the task of closing up to 70 per cent of the Tümen region ' s demand for these products.
Leonid Ostroumov, Deputy Director of Investment Policy, recommended that greater attention be paid to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also addressed by forms of State support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year, 150 million roubles are earmarked for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The latter commission, which will consider subsidization treaties, accepts documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses local producers for their participation in international fairs.
The next year's budget provides for 150 million roubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to fairs, 3 million to energy saving programmes.
Up to 72 million roubles are being reduced to reimbursement of the ordered and paid equipment produced in the southern Tumen Region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, this form of support will end in the long run, as it was the reason for its introduction to compensate for the mining tax that oil companies paid to the district budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government considers the area to be a priority of direct support for industrial enterprises rather than of financing through the oil industry.
The budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern over the current oil situation.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchased is a competitive advantage for the southern Tumen Region industry and will be difficult to compete with the Russian average, with cheaper labour.
In addition, it is not clear whether the new owner of TNC-XR, Rosneft, has yet to place his orders in the prison enterprises.
The Wawatsky Project Agreement expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension were received.
Southern enterprises that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector are currently unable to form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes will be received from oil obtained in the Uvati region in the budget of the region, or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the sites.
Tommych will be serving 240 hours for an extremist social media video
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced 240 hours of compulsory work by a city resident who had posted a video of extremist direction on the social network, RIA Novosti reported on Friday a press service representative of the District Court.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his website on a popular social network, which was placed on the federal list of extremist material.
Criminal proceedings have been brought against him under the Criminal Code, “Actions to incite hatred and hostility, as well as to humiliate the dignity of the person committed in public”.
“The Leninsk District Court considered the case in a special manner and found the man to be guilty of the above-mentioned offence by punishing 240 hours of compulsory work”, said the interlocutor of the agency.
She added that the man fully pleaded guilty.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in the prices of goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov of Ukraine is convinced that prices in the country will decrease significantly once the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said so during a conversation with his Facebook page readers.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs charges.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that's going to mean prices have to go down.
“This is about products coming from EU countries”, said Azarov.
As far as other goods are concerned, the impact on prices will not be so direct, it will be mediated.
However, there should not be any price increases there either.
Therefore, reports on billboards that have recently appeared in our country enough, that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, that is not exactly the case, or, more specifically, that is not the case," Azarov summarized.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Bisk
On 29 October, the media reported that a kindergarten in Biysca for educational purposes had locked the child in the basement.
At present, the investigators have clarified all the circumstances, as well as legal evaluation of the actions of the staff of the children ' s garden.
After the assault, Evgenia Vasileva spoke.
Evgenia Vasiliev, whose character has been closely attached to the media for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press, both on thefts in the Minoborones and on her personal relationship with the ex-Minister of Defence Anatolia Serdukov, her poetry and the addiction to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, a figurelist of the Defence Service case violated silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev, she said: “The task was, of course, one thing: to extract any negative information from me against the former Minister of Defence.”
I was blackmailed to testify, otherwise I'll be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
The next time we go to court, we'll prove our innocence.
We're 100 percent confident of the victory.
In doing so, we can conclude from the interview that perhaps Vasilev’s most important point of view was that she was not interested in taste.
It is likely that there was a statement by the official representative of the UK Vladimir Markin that counterfeits were found in the collection of paintings collected by the figurelist of the Defense Services case.
Among the property arrested are a number of paintings that the householder, convinced of her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the artistic expertise commissioned by investigators after the arrest of these paintings has found that they have no artistic value and, simply, are cheap forgeries," Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Minoboron, and said that I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss any personal points?
I think it's just a mess," says Vasilev.
On the other hand, whether she admits her guilt in one of the 12 criminal episodes she had committed, Vasilev said: “Of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the U.S.R. that Vasileva was avoiding the study of the criminal record, the figureist's lawyer stated that he and his client, “the investigator, did not get to know the case material”.
What has led to the revelations of the house arrest of Vasileva, who has not been in contact with the press?
Perhaps how could a woman not answer the charges of bad taste?
Or is it the rights of the newspaper Komsomolka, who claimed a few days ago that she “fell into an even bigger trance under house arrest” because of reports of reconciliation of Anatolia Serdjukov with his wife and his return to the family?
A prominent military observer of the KP, Victor Baranets, wrote in his article "Serdukov returned to his wife?": "The investigators do not rule out that after such shock she may become more conversational at interrogations."
Previously, Vasilev's allegations of the illegal sale of Minoboron's real estate took over.
Premature troubles.
What needs to be done in the garden before the freezing
In the fall, it is better to select medicated drugs, such as a 1% broth mixture or abiga-Pik, Oxyhom, Ordan et al.
Do you think the tourists have gone into the past through the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year return forecast and is expecting record returns from those who are resting in Australia and Britain.
This tourist firm now expects its main full annual income before tax to be from $325 million to $340 million, compared with a previous forecast ranging from $305 million to $315 million.
If current orientations are reached, this will be a 12 to 17 per cent increase compared to a record profit of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre had received 8 per cent of its first half of the year and started the second half with good indicators, especially for weekly trips to Australia and Britain.
“From the beginning of the year, we have been making a profit to our 10 countries, and for some of them, a record high profit is expected in the full year before deduction of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
This includes Australia and Britain, which usually bring us the greatest profits.”
In Australia, leisure activities resumed during the second half of the year, offset by a slightly weaker internal market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business was good, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States compensated losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year and was expected to earn profits for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre stock rose 3 cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, Barnaul police discovered two gaming halls.
He was the first to work in the Industrial District on the Street of the Air Force.
At the time of the inspection, there was a game going on at the establishment.
There were 24 machine guns in the club.
Another game club was found in Lenin district on Anton Petrova Street.
20 slot machines were used here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation reports that administrative materials have been produced under the heading “Unlawful Organization and Conduct of Gambling”.
Technically, it's a glitch.
In the near future, the facts will be forwarded to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Ekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are investigating a criminal who has been brutally involved with two sisters.
After they killed their bodies, they burned down.
As reported by the New Region in the press service of the Ministry of Public Health in Sverdlovsk district, two women were found dead in a three-room apartment on Uralska street in the Kyrov district of the Ural capital.
Soon the victims were identified.
It turned out that she was a sister, one of them a 44-year-old resident of Yekaterinburg, the other a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg Region.
The burning apartment was taken off a few days ago.
His investigation was under the personal control of the main police region of Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities are working on different versions of the murder, checking the alibis of previously tried citizens and persons prone to such acts.
It also establishes the purpose for women to rent an apartment and where they lived before they did what they were doing, who they were in a relationship with.
Schools called for greater attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
English literature courses will require students to study at least one of Shakespeare’s plays, 19th - century novels, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature from 1914 onward.
“Out-of-programme texts” will also be presented at the examination to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined English-language course will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to pass a separate language examination, with strong recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is due tomorrow to issue new English and mathematics training programmes, the first items to be reviewed radically.
It will amend other major items next year.
OFQUAL will provide a revised structure for secondary school examinations, with a new evaluation system and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Hove, said that “a broad consensus had been reached that we must reform our system of examinations in order to restore public trust”, insisting that school examinations would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has about 138 hours of pupils.
Although there would be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics, the sources in the coalition said that large school math examinations, combined with an increased rating rate, would most likely provide incentives for schools to provide additional education on this subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to real-life tasks, including financial mathematics.
The Hayhe tickets will cost tourists 2,200 roubles
Tomorrow, the tourists from Blasgowszczensk in Hahe will begin to carry ships in the airbag.
For those who wish to travel to China, this means additional losses.
The puma ticket is traditionally much more expensive than the heat.
As reported in AmuroASSO, the cost of the usual ticket will be 2,200 roubles.
There will be 2,800 roubles per room of increased comfort.
By the way, in this season, the tickets did not travel: at the same price, tourists were driving and passing in the spring, and a year ago, in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth is insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth rate of its GDP to be insufficient for the RF, and he is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, based on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned this year to increase GDP in the area of 3 per cent, maybe even a little more.
It's going to be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of a recession in a number of European countries, it seems to be not bad, but it is not bad for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher pace.
It is very important now that Russian companies, Russian business, receive normal loans at a normal price, the first thing that needs to be done,” emphasized the head of Government.

Travel through mud, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, not many doctors — just one in 5,000 people
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main characters of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main heroes to become the hero of CNN.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
During the 21st year, George Bwelle saw his father come back to life and go back to unconscious condition, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jaméf Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of itself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Georges Bwelle said.
If we had the money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“It’s not easy,” said Bewelle.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed significantly since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor to 413.
And even if the Cameroonians could consult a doctor, many of them would be out of hand.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the health costs are private.
“The only problem is poverty,” said Bwelle.
“And because of poverty they cannot enjoy their lives.”
After seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a judge surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It also established a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which will organize a weekend trip to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 others are loaded into vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies, and traveled through a crossed area to visit the needy in the village.
They're not always good luck.
Many times they had to push cars through rivers and mud.
But when they come, they meet them as true heroes: it is a festival with songs and dances and the best rooms that locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed an occasion for the holiday, and Bwelle, with its wide smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade starts taking hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people on each trip,” said Bewelle.
They come from all over the county 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics provides a variety of health services on weekends.
Many people receive treatment from malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive bones, donated glasses or free birth certificates — documents needed for school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
After the evenings, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school, municipality or house building; after the procedure, patients stand up and go into the post-operational zone in order to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operating and sanitation equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning of Sunday.
It's a slow pace, but the team's commitment usually helps to support the village musicians.
“They beat drums all night to keep us awake and to keep us working,” said Bewelle.
On Sunday, the crew head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those who assist them.
One person explained that his free operation for the treatment of rodents would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinics and hospital work, Bwelle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second job that he said provided 60 per cent of the funding for his non-profit organization; the remaining funds were covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a medical student at the second class of Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwell group.
He's always either in the hospital or he's trying to make money for the organization so that the campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bevell in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity that they would never receive at home.
"We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove stains of blood or hold instruments for Dr. Bewell," said O'Malley.
As a second-year student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Voluntary students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transportation and training pay Bwelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help Cameroon’s people endlessly.
For Bewell, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live a happy life by fulfilling their father’s promise is a great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job, ” said Bewelle.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to testify against Merkel's wiretap
The MP of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Shrebele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
In the course of the discussion, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the FWG Attorney General in the case of a possible telephone hearing by the Chancellor of Germany by US police.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or Germany.
He made a clear point, said Hans Christian Shrobber, which he knows very much.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Kit Alexander blocked all of his movements, Snowden was ready to come to Germany.
First, however, it is necessary to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators are beginning to act in response to the U.S. spy scandal.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the United States electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Mackey, told reporters about this at a press conference following a meeting with Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, correspondent BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the two governments will provide widespread support and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves," said Vladimir Mackey.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all necessary conditions for that purpose and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission, following which the protocol was signed, was held in Ankara.
The Parties have drawn up a road map of Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy agency, aims to deepen bilateral cooperation in the trade, economic and investment fields, in the areas of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and in the search for new forms and directions of interaction.
“The protocol of the past meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey regard each other as reliable partners”, he said.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that the foreign policy chiefs of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects during the negotiations.
The trade between Belarus and Turkey, according to the Minister, should be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded.
It will also create all the necessary conditions for trade and economic ties and for the success of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama rejects his words about health
In the midst of a storm of criticism, President Obama came to the tarmac yesterday about his often repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it”.
Noting that hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination of services from their providers, the Republicans have criticized the President in recent days for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama made some adjustments to his initial public promise.
“Most people with health insurance who work can retain it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he called “renewal in the news” on the cessation of services, Obama called upon Americans who received these notices to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
"You get more favourable conditions," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance themselves could be forced to change plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Accessible Medical Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans that you deserve better,” said Sibelius in a statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who has been responsible for the implementation of the law on accessible medical care, said that Internet sales have been running a “frequently bad” since October.
“I’m upset and upset just like everything else, ” she said.
“I want your trust back very much.”
The angry Sibelius defended this phrase, which was caught by a microphone behind her at yesterday's hearings in the Chamber following a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives of Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long again urged Sibelius to say why “the architect” of the law on available medical care voluntarily refused the government-sponsored insurance to acquire the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt has denied media coverage for non-censored dams.
On 31 October, Moshorsud decided to accept the invalid registration license of Rosbalt, writes Lenta.
Roskomnadzor insisted that the media agency be deprived of its status - systematic and gross violations of the media law.
An unfortunate precedent was established during the trial: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing to issue the right to impose counter-arguments.
What is Rosbalt?
The Rossbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency opened the second main office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency since 2001.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most well-known private Internet media in Russia.
In doing so, Rosbalt has always occupied quite a specific niche: the agency's core of exclusive publications (and so far) were notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions on the proximity of the publication to power structures continued throughout the Agency.
In addition to having a large source base in various departments, Rosbalt also said that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project.
At the same time, Chaplin's role in the Rosbalt leadership is not clear: it is commonly referred to as “the project manager”.
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Afónina, editor-in-chief, Nikolay Ulyanov.
In recent times, Rosbalt has not been listed in the federal media ratings, either in quotes or in audiences.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the LiveInternet coverage of Russian media websites.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), a month of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months are the Kremlin's note of the helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of a soloist of the King and Shoot group, the massacres in the capital city of Birulev.
The Rosbalta conflict with the Rosskomnaszor began in July 2013, when amendments to the Media Act entered into force, prohibiting journalists from using a censored dam.
The company found a prohibited lecture in two videos published on the agency's website (“Jigit of Krasnodar” and “Pussy Riot desecrated oil towers”).
The other sides describe it differently.
On the basis of the videos found, Rosbalt accused the media of gross and systematic violation of the law and applied for a licence from the agencies.
Rosbalte stated that the claims of the department were incorrect: first, the subtitles were not editorial material, secondly, the material words in them were masked, and thirdly, immediately after the warning of the role was removed from the site.
The representatives of the agency appealed the claims of Rossomnadzor to the world court, and when Moshorsud accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, 25 numbers have already been decided by the world judge not in favour of Rosbalt: Nikolay Ulyanov, editor-in-chief, found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 roubles for 10,000 for each roll.
Obviously, this prejudged the outcome of the Mosgorood hearing, if you refuse to think that the outcome could have been decided earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate Rosbalta's registration certificate, effectively depriving the media agency.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by members of Gosduma (an application to head Alexander Jarov signed 26 deputies on 10 October; the document was submitted on the initiative of CRC).
The head of the Russian Journalists' Union, Ovlov Bogdanov, President of the Moscow Journalists' Union, Pavel Gusev, and Mikhail Fedotov, President of the Human Rights Council, claimed that the publication was illegal.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of the Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that no case would come before the licence was withdrawn.
The Rosbalt Court has shown that under whose jurisdiction the media in Russia is safer today is a big question.
Syria destroyed chemical equipment.
Syria had destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capacities, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of Damascus disarmament was completed the day before the deadline.
Prior to 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of warfare toxic substances for use by BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, the toxic substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people died during the chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time to allow the Syrian authorities to carry out more weapons and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from resting.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time OPCW and Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There are a lot of questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be scrutinized carefully by Western intelligence.
They will gladly advise the Inspectors of new facilities for verification if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not entirely frank.
The United States is of the opinion that the attack was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia are insisting that this is the case with the hands of Syrian rebels.
The global community has demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached with the Russian mediation, destroy or in a non-working state all capacities for the production and filling of ammunition, gas and liquids and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been completed, the destruction of the already existing weapons of the Syrian army should be the next step.
This arsenal is expected to contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic toxic substances, dermal mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
It requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities agree on a timetable for action to begin — two weeks.
OPCW Field Operation Chief Jerry Smith stated that his inspectors “have personally observed the destruction of equipment”.
"They are now unable to produce or mix chemical weapons further," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that the shelling and poisoning plants were either destroyed or decomposed.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to conduct an inspection there, as stated in the document, but the equipment from there has been transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical-producing infrastructure was “especially difficult” because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said that it was not yet time for inspectors to celebrate it; they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage has gone “unlikely far away”
John Kerry demonstrated a softening of U.S. tracking software tactics by making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. spying “has gone a bit too far. ”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barak Obama, of being “on the autopilot” at the time of the appearance of the massive disclosures of Edward Snowden on the spying activities of the NSA.
These leaks were put by the U.S. Government to the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as the other members of the Government, actually took some of the things happening on the autopilot because this opportunity existed — both during the Second World War and in the very difficult years of the cold war and of course on 11 September.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States Government to admit that the U.S. spying had gone too far, but stressed that no one had been violated.
He said: "In some cases this has gone a long way.
And the President is determined to shed light on the matter and to explain himself to people, and he is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has any sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted on good grounds and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented the crash of aircraft, the explosion of buildings and the killing of people, because we have been able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, US legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged U.S. spy abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
The senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had spoken with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to cease participation in anti-terrorism organizations because of the disappointment of the National Security Agency's monitoring.
“In the interests of US national security, it is really important for Europeans to remain in favour of our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said Democrat Murphy, who works for the first time and who is chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
The news that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency stated this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures revealed Snowden's documents indicating that the NSA monitored the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended spying on allies as necessary and said it was a normal case on both sides.
Against the backdrop of this turmoil, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would be part of both parties and chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be heard in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to promote improved relations, he said that some degree of “frost out of the best interests” would also be demonstrated.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spying programmes they have been using for many years.
“While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they should also agree that we are not the only ones doing intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry must go to this weekend in the Middle East and Poland to address the issues of hostility with regard to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence.
The influence of prison inmates will increase in the new compositions of the public observation commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new compositions of the public observatory commissions (UNC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists will increase their influence.
ONCs are public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The cases of Sergey Magnithsky and Leonid Razhájeva, the disturbances in the colony of the Republic of Korea, are the result of most of the resonative incidents behind bars.
The control of NNCs is a struggle between human rights defenders and violent lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the OPC, I proposed that the selection of experience in human rights activities should be considered.
"He was not accepted, and the list was drawn up without criteria," says Valery Borschev.
Borštev is the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Independent Observer Association, the all-Russian human rights defenders working on prison issues.
In the household of Mr. Gosduma of Apple, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The OP Council should vote in favour of OPC membership in 43 regions of the country.
At 1800 vacant places, fewer than thousands of applicants were sought, while in Ingusheti and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions were unable to be held due to the absence of candidates.
The O.P. pledges to organize a pre-charge for vacant places.
Moscow's OPC is one of the few commissions with competition, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new membership instead of 20 participants.
According to Borštev, 11 human rights defenders and 9 bullies are currently in the capital commission, and the polling option changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to join the capital commission.
However, the new membership may be re-entered by the representative of the Battle Brotherhood, Vjeceslav Kalinin.
He had been a member of the ONC for three years but had never visited the prisoners.
Borštev believes that the gymnasiums, having appointed their Chairman, would make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights defenders do not exclude the collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of silicas is coordinated by Anton Tsvetkov, a member of the ONC, headed by the Russian officers, an organization that defends the interests of the power agencies.
"I don't eat babies on the rug," said RBC daily Anton Tsvetkov.
He denied that he was lobbying for the promotion of any lists and said that he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Tsvetkova, he didn't even care what list they're voting for in the OP.
It considers the publication of Combat Information to be a form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the leadership of the Cape Verdean ONC.
Its former leaders will be suspended because of last year's spearwaves.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the management of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
And now, the ONK Rostova-na-Donu can move from human rights defenders to the gymnasium.
Of the new lists, the Human Rights Chairman of the local commission had turned out to be one of his opponents, although in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber had ruled him out for unethical conduct.
The lists of the Moscow and Growth Commission of Borszczev are considered as “a place for Kopeisk”.
The revelations of Tolokonnikov’s hope did not affect the Mordovian ONC, which they consider “strong”: only one human rights woman wanted to be part of the new composition, and she did not even accept the documents for the competition.
A member of the OP Council Nikolai Swandze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Donu.
He sent out his position to the other members of the council.
His colleague on the OP, Pavel Gusev, said he voted in favour, as he liked the proposed Moscow list.
Co-ordinated the preparation of lists of ONCs, Deputy Secretary of the POP, Vladislav Grib, also a staff member of the FSIN Research Institute.
Grib told RBK daily that he did not consider it appropriate to split candidates for human rights defenders and militias and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient powers to impede the work of its members.
The mushroom shall not be allowed to predict the outcome of the vote of the OP council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a revised version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against prison terms in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, filed an appeal against a sentence and was released on bail.
Steve Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on 15 June by the Phuket Provincial Court of Justice of false claims following a report by the Thai police that a local taxi driver had attacked her on Sunday night on 10 June, while two other men had detained her.
However, video cameras later revealed that she had returned to her hotel well after breaking her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
Before the trial, she was kept in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at the centre of general detention on the outskirts of Phuket, not in a female adult prison.
She is the daughter of a former Australian League player, Peter Tanks, who applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help from his daughter.
Tanx told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the well-being of their daughter and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“It was obviously a worrying time, but we hope that it will return home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed his sentence and was released on bail in 50,000 baht.
According to Australian reports, she is currently taking her leave in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could lead to an increase in her sentence of up to two years and will force her to serve a adult prison term.
However, after the recent murder of Australian tourist Michel Smith in Phuket Thailand, Thailand may also seek to restore its ruined tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his novel Eltisheva, translated into French.
To remind you, it was his novel that became the finalist of four prizes: "Fair Pole", "Russian Booker", "National bestseller" and "The Big Book".
Last year, the author was awarded a prize from the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undisputed leader in the generation of the current 30-year-old and 40-year-old prozaics.
Almost every publication of his hard, modern - day life stories and rumors has sparked heated disputes among critics of a wide variety of ways.
It can be argued that the consolidated articles on Saint Helena's prose and publicity, reviews of his books and journalism have produced interesting and surprising Russian literature landscapes since the late 1990s before the early 2010s.
The discussion of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, mostly refers to its participants as being understood by the word “literation”, as the present and future not only of our word but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are generally included in the abbreviations under “Abzacs”.
