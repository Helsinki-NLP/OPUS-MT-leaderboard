Novak helped Trabzonspor to the second place, hit damage as well.
The defender Filip Novák helped with the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonsporu to the title of Deputy Minister.
His team won 2-1 on the Kayserispor field and kept the third Besiktas behind him.
Attacker Milan Škoda gave after the January crossing from Slavia already the tenth goal for Rizespor, which was saved, even though he passed 1:3 on the Fenerbahce field.
Novak confirmed on the defense the excellent productivity of the seven goals in this league year.
In 63 minutes, the goalkeeper Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech football player burned the ball from the corner into the net.
Domestics managed to settle down five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute the setting took his side when successfully finished the score of four to one.
The damage at the beginning of the second half of the game with Fenerbahce leveled in salt at 1:1.
Although the risk did not last long, it did not have to worry him, as the results of the rivals left three points over the descent zone.
The competition ends on Sunday duel of the master Basaksehir at Kasimpasa court.
The well-secret cave in the deserter's forest in New Bor was not actually a resident.
In the north of Bohemia in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, not far from the Nové Boru in Czechoslovakia, several sandstone rock formations are hidden in the forests led by the Countess Road.
Natural and artificial created.
And we're going to go after the human hand created.
The place is called Cave by the deserter.
But in fact, there was never a deserter here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely the hidden chamber of grain.
The cave is carved from side to side of the rock cliff and accessible on the stairs above.
At the same time, it's practically impossible to see until the last minute.
It will reveal it up to the narrow stairs leading to a rock gallery, from which it is only entered into the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human habitats, at the time of creation it could have been on the mountaintop, where the forest is today, the field.
"The fact that this object has no window and even at the traditional location of the vesicle, clearly demonstrates that no deserter could never survive the winter," explains historian Kamil Podružek of the Faculty of Philosophy of John Evangelist Purkyna in Ústí nad Labem.
A single space object has only a stone bench in the back, apparently serving to drop the vessels.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podužek.
There are traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
The topping of the sandstone was quite simple and fast for the dedicated ones.
It was enough to use spores and sandstones gradually to break down.
According to the length of the track after the tip, and in general the cutting method, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, there is a person who sleeps at times in today's times.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest roads and take you under the cave of a running duck and a nearby Countess Road, you will certainly find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the woods, you might still be caught by the nearby Havranje Rock.
Žoke Minařík is in artificial sleep after a severe fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best of hands now.
The Institute is arranged for similar cases, and we have a part of the family in Hanover fortunately.
This greatly eases the situation and also the care of the daughter of Finju," the server Jedsci.cz quoted Minarík's wife Katji as saying.
"Everyone makes the most of it, Philip now needs time to reconvalescate.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered a problem of trauma to the heads and patients in an artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We must all be patient now and give him time," the woman said a five-year-old jockey.
To the financial support of injured Minarík, he called on Twitter and star Frankie Dettori, who won the 7th King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, balancing Lester Piggott's legend.
On the Gofundme server, nearly 70,000 euros have been selected for today.
The target is €100,000 (2.6 million crowns).
The referee took four goals to Sassuol footballers, lost 0:2
Although the Sassuola football players in the Naples Saturday game got four times the ball into their opponent's goal, they eventually had to accept defeat 0:2.
None of their goals were recognized by the referee after consulting the video because of the cast.
According to the Italian media, it's a record enemy of technology, so many hits have never been made by a single team.
"Var was more severe on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no other team.
New technology is breaking records," said Gazzetta dello Sport in a comment.
"The Festival of Unrecognized Goales of Sassuol.
He has never been so hard on one team before," added the letter Corriere dello Sport.
Neapol took the lead at 8 o'clock on Saturday, but after half an hour of the game it seemed that Sassuolo had settled.
Philip Djuricchi's goal, however, was not recognized by the intervention of the video referee for his assailance.
For the same reason, there were no other Djuričič's intervention and clubs Francesca Caputa and Domenico Berardi.
On the contrary, they added another goal.
Electromobiles report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, the highest in history
"The increase was as high as 30 per cent in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registration of new e-auts," said CEZ Chief of Clean Technology Tomáš Chmělík.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, the Tesla electromobile manufacturers, but also Bill and Lidl supermarkets, report their part on the market.
In addition, MOL represents the operators of classical pumping stations.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our electromobility network only last year," Jana Jusková explained.
The daily edition, however, exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by CEZ.
It turns out that the drivers from the stations took 13.5 kWh on average.
This corresponds to the arrival of about a hundred kilometres of a smaller electric vehicle.
If we skip the small draw until 1 kWh, it takes an average charge of two and a half hours.
The vast majority of the refuelling took place in a free tariff.
If the motorists had already paid for the pickup, their typical loss was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly in the capital.
The territory of Prague is home to all five of ČEZ's most difficult rechargers, which, with its popularity, is also covered by the entire regional cities.
Between the regions, Olomouc leads.
On the other hand, the smallest interest is for remote stations in the border, such as Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unutilized throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electromobiles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-outs arrived.
Eight percent of readers said that they were considering buying an electric car to their family in a large survey of the daily "The Czechs in Movement".
However, only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their vicinity.
Not just for better water retention.
Green activists protested in Prague
According to organisers, the government's current steps on the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and on the solution to the climate crisis are insufficient, speakers called on the state to take a more controversial approach.
Events called The Last Drop were attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Ghost Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party of Greens, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have here, for example, people who stand against long-term expansion at the Turkish Valley, there are people who stand up against the mining of gravel at the Uher Island, there are people who stand up against the construction of senseless dams," Marika Volf said as organizers.
It noted that the main requirements of protestors are the establishment of a plan to retain water in the landscape, the dramatic change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system towards promoting sustainable agriculture and the rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is to defend people's interests, not reckless and depressing business," she said.
A stand was placed on the Malopartran Square with a petition calling for representatives of the Czech State to propose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and restoration of Czech soil and landscape.
Present people were equipped with banners with passwords such as "The End of the Rape Dip" or "The Less of the Coal, More of the boats".
From southern Moravia to Prague Jan Škoda came from the Water Association for people protesting the plan of gravel mining in Hodonina.
"Threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that drilling is the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned gravel mining is estimated to be only about 500 metres from the wells, and according to the estimates it is certain that water quality will be threatened.
The so-called agroecological farmers came from the village of Valèt in Karlovy Větelý.
He drew attention to the layings of small barnacles, which are not married to income and profit and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Little agro-ecological farms are able to feed the whole population on a totally normal basis, and they do not do so in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died on a plane crash into a house in Germany
Three people died today in the fall of an ultralight plane to an apartment house in western Germany, and two others were injured.
Local rescue agents reported that there were likely two crew members and one resident of the house among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The undercover apartment, which was one of the five housing units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy Commander of local firefighters Robert Meyboom reported that the two crew members of the aircraft had apparently died.
The third victim, according to the police, is a woman who lived in the house.
Diary Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote in response to Mayor Wesel that it was the mother of a single parent whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a brake on landing.
The police are based on the fact that they come from a crashed plane.
There was a two-person seat on the plane.
The machine started at the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The daily Rheinische Post, with a reference to the eyewitnesses, said that before the plane collapsed, the plane crashed with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ wrote in response to other witnesses that the aircraft had fallen into the air before impact.
The Czech savings room wrongly charged some payments with a card twice on Saturday.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
Czech savings to her clients on Saturday afternoon miscalculated some payments by card twice.
According to the speaker bank, Lukaš Kropík's problem may have involved thousands of transactions.
She's already cleared the savings room, and she's returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double counting of card payments were recorded by the savings board on Saturday afternoon.
"Just yesterday (on Saturday) at night we updated the system and returned all these double payments to clients immediately.
At this point, everything works without any problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to which the bank deducted the money from card payments twice was not known by the bank's spokesman, according to his estimate, was less than a thousand transactions.
The causes of the problems are well known.
"It could be a combination of multiple factors," said Dropik.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
She had 4.6 million at the end of March.
The owner of the savings company is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is the key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
On Monday, the troops will present a system of three emergency levels against coronavir
"They will be consistent with the force of community distribution at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch said in the Czech Republic.
It is a so-called semafor, and individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red colour according to the risk of coronavir.
The minister added that the inclusion of individual regions would still be discussed with epidemiologists.
He admitted that only Moravianskoslezský kraj would now have orange colour and would be closer to Prague.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygienic stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at the regional level because the situation is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
Vodnik and Karolínka
When the waterman Jonah and the miller’s daughter, Karolínka, look at each other, it is not at all easy.
Jonah's love is hindered by his father, an impeccable waterman, and Karolínka has no reason to believe that her dear Jonah is not human.
Thankfully, there's a young man named Libor who will do everything in his power to protect the whole village, especially Karolínek, from this waterfall.
What if she's intrigued and lying?
Especially if she can turn the girl, Karolínka, Jonah, away and prefers him, a powerful Libor.
Soon everyone is clear about who can drown the nightgown, spoiled flour, fire mill and other lotteries.
The scattered villagers will hunt for a waterman, and an irresistible water curse will befall Jonah’s head.
And now the Cowboy's soul of the Karolíns!
How to soften old Hastrebuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah’s innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the curse?
The story was filmed in September 2010 in the Czech studies and in the exteriors of the Brzin pond, in Obděnice in Sedlčanska and in the beautiful environment of the historical mill in Hoslovice.
Mosty autodrom launches new e-shop
Customers of a bridge car can use a new e-shop on its website.
They will also buy vouchers for free and test driving by car or motorcycle on a large race track, which was previously possible only in person with an autodrome worker in the starting tower.
"We have come to improve the e-shop so that it is user-friendly, and at the same time we have expanded the portfolio of products and services that can be built through it.
At the same time, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of 1 000 crowns for all courses of safe driving from our offer.
The discount coupon will be found on the page www.autodrom-most.cz," explained Business and Marketing Director of AutoDROM MOST Jana Svobodová.
The e-shop website is now transparent, and the customer is easily orientated in it.
"The visitor of the e-shop chooses a focus on which he aims on the list.
For example, sport, courses for safe or sports driving, training, experience programs, gift items, gift vouchers, activities for children and others," the director said.
Among the new products and e-shop services offered include, for example, the Racing Legends Trico collection with surprise, car track, a course of safe driving for reduced visibility, advertising and gift items of the domestic professional racing team Buggyra Racing or the Engelmuller gloves from the limited edition of the BOHEMATIC clockwork, created on the occasion of the historic victory in the prestigious race 24 hours Le Mans in 1949.
"The offer is very varied, the customer can choose from over 200 items," Jana Svobodová explained.
One of four options may be chosen by the customer when paying for the selected product or service.
Advance payment (bank transfer), delivery, cash at personal collection or online via the payment gate.
The disease is mild, only three percent infected in the hospital.
A milder form of coronavir is either spreading to the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of the sun has greatly improved our immunity.
Hospital infective wards are half empty, even though the number of infected is growing.
"This situation today and in April is quite different and it is given primarily by the number of hospitalized," says the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth reminding us that on April 11th, when the first wave of the epidemic took place, all the clothes were carried out by the army, the republic was closed, and the Czechs consumed disinfection a year in advance.
Yet, ten people died a day.
Now, the daily increase in the number of infected is higher, but every day with covid-19, two people die at most.
The highest number of people infected still has Karvinsko, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to the outbreak at the local Alzheimer's centre, where there are 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Other homes for seniors have closed a hygiene station in Černosice on Královéhradeck.
The disease was confirmed by one of the nurses.
"We're digesting, we've limited movement, we have all hygienic measures," says pension home director Martin Schaniel.
According to him, none of the clients in the home have any symptoms of the disease so far.
The thorough testing will start tomorrow, and then they will decide on further measures.
Hospitals also respond to an increased number of infected people.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people have a pendant when they enter.
The record reports South Bohemian hygiene, which recorded 25 cases of coronavir - most of them are foreign employees of a labour company.
Overall, 131 infected people arrived on Saturday - half the Friday number - but less testing on weekends.
Debutant champion!
Van den Berg wrote a fairy tale, Anderson's trashed
The great surprise of the tournament on behalf of Dimitri van den Bergh demonstrated an excellent performance in the fight against the player who won the second most prestigious PDC company in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced by both sides, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian scepter.
Van den Bergh took a 12-bit leg, and he's been on top ever since.
He literally drilled his opponent's game, and the more experienced "Flying Scot" was hard to get to doubles.
The way "The Dream Maker" had it in his head, he also shows that the distraught Anderson played his first maximum until the 24th leg.
In addition, a young Belgian managed a great high checkout.
Last time he lost in his 11th leg, because of a negative condition, he caught a big fish and closed 170.
At the end of the game, there was a huge frustration on Anderson.
The arrows were more likely to be thrown away, and behind the triumph, his crouching rival began entirely sovereignly.
Van den Bergh changed the first of three dates and received his name - he wrote his big dream.
The profit of trophies named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian scepter that this is his first winning major.
It continues to be so true that Karel Sedlaček is the last player to defeat the van den Berga.
Nantes was charged with a cathedral fire, a man confessed.
St. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral in Nantes’ heart began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th - century window and destroyed the organ.
Investigators examined the suspicion of arson because the fire was moving through the temple from three different places.
At the same time, police at the entrances found no evidence of violence being committed in the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer at a local diocese, a nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating a criminal prosecution.
The prosecution now informed that, on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faced charges of arson.
If he is found guilty, he will face up to ten years in prison and a fine.
According to his lawyer, a man is sorry and decided to cooperate fully with the investigator, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is designed to play the role of a pandemic plan, which is the reason why the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism.
"They will be consistent with the force of community expansion," the minister explained.
He added that, for example, Moravskoslezský kraj or Prague would reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in each region differs significantly, it has been supplemented.
On the system, the Ministry collaborated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (USIS).
Specific measures will be imposed at each level, according to the Minister, whether it is the obligation to carry gloves or to organise special departments in hospitals.
In order to create an epidemiological plan in the Prima Partie TV series, Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), according to which people should have clear information on what measures can be expected if the epidemiological situation deteriorates.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by saying that nothing in the main event is on the spot to talk about declaring a state of emergency or recommencement of a crisis squad.
In view of the increasing number of people infected from Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has again established the obligation to wear gloves at internal events of over 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now 1,000 people.
The government’s procedure, when the measures were not clear and when they began to pay or were announced, faced criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main actors should create a sense of security on the contrary and the confusion on the other hand," said Senator Marek Hilcher in Questions.
Measures can now vary according to the region, for example in Prague from Sunday to Sunday, the obligation to wear gloves in absentia medical facilities, such as in pharmacy or waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear gloves when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has been introduced since Friday also in the region of Liberec and Ústice.
At the University of Jihlava it is necessary to wear gloves in the internal public space, in the MHD and in medical facilities since 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidaemic measures have been released in the Moravian Region, as has the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government also approved a so-called semaphor for Europe, which colourfully distinguishes the level of the risk of disease in individual European countries and, accordingly, regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from those countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, the authorities have not required a negative test for coronavirus or a quarantine test for Czech citizens since 15 June.
These are mandatory for the return of Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in a low-risk category.
Technopartes in Benešovsk continue.
Plays for a third capacity, has to end at noon
The head Lhota (Benesovska) Technoparte of Lhota Lhota in Benešovsk continues on Sunday night.
He still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to evening estimates, the police here after 20:00 remain about 500 people, the original gross estimates spoke of three hundred, at 900 this morning, said police spokesman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the technoparties were to end on Sunday at noon, at which time a real part of the music systems were silent.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect it will gradually come to the disconnection and dismantling of music systems," Novak said.
"Policemen still scrutinize departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo preventive breath tests before departure," she added.
Ten police officers are overseeing the event, there is foreign police, transport and police on the spot, and there are also dogs with service dogs in the emergency.
"On the eve of today, the police checked 470 persons moving at the scene of the action and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to the breath test, six of which sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Novaková said.
A total of 95 drivers tested for the presence of stunning and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police officers also dealt with 14 offences in transport.
At the request of the participants, the police carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of intoxicating and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would be hit.
Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said so on the TV show Prima Partie.
However, the number of participants dropped below 1000, the police assessed that the intervention was not necessary and did not request it either by the health department or the health department.
On Sunday, Czech TV (ČT) said that technoparties also spread to surrounding areas whose owners did not agree to use technopartes.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will require compensation for the damage.
technologists on the meadow at Hlaváčka Lhota arrived on Friday night.
The police originally guarded the meadow in Blažima in Benešovsk on Friday, where technoparties were held last year.
It is located about 30 kilometres from Lhota Hlaváčka, where the technicians eventually took off.
According to Novak, no one came to Blajima.
The sting of the serpent: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in Iron Norway.
A girl, 2010 who had been brought to the rescue facility by her parents, was tainted by the vicar there," Dnieku told the Regional Speaker of the Health Rescue Service, Mária Svobodová, who later moved the child to the hospital in Klatovy.
The snake is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in Shumava that these animals occur in a higher number, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, these animals are not at great risk.
The chance that the snake will bite you isn't too high, they're afraid of being in regular contact.
And if there's room for it, she likes to sneak away for a loud meeting.
They only attack if they feel a lot at risk - for example, if you step on it by mistake.
Even her sting is not a tragedy, but her poison is very effective against small mammals, but people will not die.
This can only happen if you have a particularly weakened organism, or if you suffer from allergies.
The risk is therefore primarily for children, seniors and allergics.
"Man has a frequent feeling of vomiting, sweating, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in the case of weakened individuals, and in particular allergic people, can occur to anaphylactical shock," said Denik Miriam Gredová of Klatove Hospital.
The man threatened to throw the babies out the window.
After a police officer, he poured wine and threw dishes.
After 11:00, an intervention unit broke into the apartment and the man was detained.
The children were immediately taken into the care of health care professionals, said in a press report to the Regional Police spokesman Markéta Janovská.
The man didn't want to cooperate with the police, throw a bowl, knife or pour it out of the window with a police negotiator.
Several times during the negotiations, he strengthened his threats by leaning with the child in his arms from the window.
One day he even climbed to the window window where he was walking.
The men's police are still investigating.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.
Stosurová prefers her daughter to tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur won't hit an affected season with coronavir this year.
Thirty-year-old U.S. Open 2011 champion, who became a mother in June, but doesn't want to finish his career yet.
Next year he plans to return to the courts and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, tennis will be enjoyed even more than before.
Stosurova announced two weeks ago on social networks that her partner Liz Astling had a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I'll stay home, spend time with my family, I'll be with all those little milestones that our Evie will spend in the next six months, and I'll just enjoy it," the former world-wide refrigerator said in four games on the Australian Union website.
WTA Tour will resume since March the interrupted season of August 3rd in the Antuk tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Marketplace: Razie discovered meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area transported 1,320 pieces of shingle eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the holding," said the State Veterinary Administration.
When checking the live fish stand, it was then found that the seller had no evidence of the origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered problematic from a veterinary point of view in the long term.
For example, in the autumn of the year, the veterinarians discovered an illegal food market, with almost half a ton of unmarked foods without proof of origin.
Most failed to determine the date of consumption, part of the products had a period of durability and had been damaged.
For five kilograms of sleep, the date of durability was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterans with police officers detained at the market area of 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, oil or frozen ducks, and part of it was moldy.
Putin was on the phone with Zelensky before the opening of the Donbas truce, Kreml criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian protocessian Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he is scheduled to start a new truce from midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin statement, criticised, inter alia, the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to hold local elections; Kyev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
At the new calm of the weapons, the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia agreed on Wednesday evening to support the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The truce is to begin at midnight on Monday night, be "full and general" and open the way for the fulfilment of other provisions of peace agreements.
Putin, in his interview with Zelensky, said that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to organise local elections contradicts the peace agreement with Minsk and threatens the prospects for resolving the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the forthcoming elections to local representatives would not take place in the territory controlled by the pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kyev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian territory occupied by separatists with Russia after providing broad autonomy to these regions and local elections.
According to the agency, the Union indicated that both statesmen had agreed on the benefits of the coming truce in Donbas and on the need to implement further measures to promote peace in the region, such as decommissioning of the areas of combat or withdrawing part of the units from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putina to release Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, on the occupied Crimea peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement has helped to stop the fighting, but on both sides of the front, people continue to die in occasional shootings and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West blame Russia for the military support of separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made the end of the Donbas war his priority, but there has not been a major breakthrough in the negotiations yet.
The 10th-battle champion is Rykl, seven-boy mastered Novotná
Advocate of the last two titles Doležal did not reach the end of Saturday's four hundredth programme, Kopecký did not jump the base in the pole on Sunday.
For decades, the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing himself in the group of coaches of Josef Karas, had been ruling for a long time, but he resigned after the discussion.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor MČR, this time the only ten fighters who had reached the 7th-thousand border.
Another medal was received by Vilém Stráský and Peter Urbanek.
After the competition, the ricket reminded Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora of the absence.
"It's a shame there weren't any guys here and Kope didn't start because those results would look completely different.
But the title tastes very well, and I appreciate the fact that I put a persona 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was still happy with the stick and most disappointed with the disk, there I was sub-moded," he admitted on the union facebook.
On the first day of the seventh day, she won with more than a hundred-point majority of Katerina Cach, although she was plagued by a wounded ankle on a retro-reflecting foot.
In the remote sector, however, she then wrote down only 570 cm, did not throw 40 meters into the spear, and did not enter the final eight - foot - long process.
Novotny collected 5878 points and won 241 points before Kateřina Dvořák.
It was mainly 631 cm long, the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it was around the 630s.
Yesterday, I started to feel sick, but I am so glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't make me feel anything," Novotná said on the union facebook.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, green operation promises
The liquefied petroleum gas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
In particular, it is popular for its substantially lower price compared to gasoline or oil, given significantly lower consumption tax, but its profitability is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like gasoline and oil, it also has its ecologically friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite new - the European market first appeared and the Czech Republic arrived several days ago, according to a press release from the Czech Association of LPG.
"In these days we have received the first 15 tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our pumping station in combination with the classic fossil LPG," quotes Jiří Karlík association from Primogas.
However, the biological LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or bionaphtha.
According to the association, after the chemical site is consistent with the classic oil LPG, which now has a number of motorists dancing in its cars.
Therefore, both versions can also be mixed at any time.
"The only difference against the classic LPG is the way it is produced," said Bio LG Ivan Indráček, Chairman of the Association.
This is also said to be one of the great benefits of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store and also the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from residues of food and cane.
In the future, it should also be made with a target, e.g. pulp biomass, i.e. wood waste.
On the other hand, the conventional petroleum LPG is formed in part as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by evaporation in the extraction of natural gas.
Thus, depending on the technology of production and the source of the operation of the bio LPG, 40-70% environmentally friendly carbon footprint is more than that of the oil LPG and up to 90% as compared to oil.
But it's not CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called part "well-to-tank" (the Czech "source to the tank").
One of the largest manufacturers of bio LPG currently belongs to the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to recent updates of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also investigating production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170 000 vehicles are driving on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment mentions a slightly higher number in the NAP ČM, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, nearly 6,000 vehicle alterations to LPG were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to charge LPG in the Czech Republic at around 950 stations of different operators.
Soldiers were audited by the number infected, number dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronavir virus.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
Sunday afternoon the number dropped from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 less infected.
Currently, 3422 people are ill in the Czech Republic.
"After the jump in the number of cured is the revision of the data that has not been sought to update hygiene recently," said Chief of Health Statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected with coronavir in the Czech Republic, 11,419 were cured and 371 Covid-19 diseases had unfortunately fallen.
Mobile electoral units or correspondence elections.
Politologist and sociologist were looking for variants for pandemic time
The amendment of the law is necessary in order for people in quarantine for coronavir to vote in October's regional and Senate elections, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (CSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He started it on Sunday at the Prima TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss a solution with representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the election law," Hamáček said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the Government to find solutions within the framework of the applicable legal rules.
However, the minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law according to which people in quarantine cannot vote for health reasons.
The ban on voting should remain maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the OVM show that the option of correspondence elections has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current draft law, which is in the Chamber, then counts on its introduction to vote abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
The Prokop also considers the fears of ANO or ČSSD (because according to experience abroad it would rather record other types of parties) from the correspondence election as overrated.
In person, it is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that there is now a need for ad hoc mechanisms (chocs) that could be implemented by this year and at the slightest health risk.
It is therefore considered to be the key to be prepared for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence choice (whether in abroad or also in the Czech Republic) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As a follow-up, he sees the voting units already mentioned, or perhaps the possibility of holding a vote within the family.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - elections during coronavir - were addressed in Croatia, Poland or France.
Various types of elections have been postponed this year in 67 countries.
Protests in Bucharest: Pig's Ears Throwing Demonsters on Government Building · Global Voices
The participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojk Borisov and his cabinet were placing pig ears on the building of the government.
It was another of a series of protests against the "Mafian style of rule" that have been held in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a national blockade at the centre of the national blockade, said the DPA.
Today's protest, which took place 18 days later, had a weaker participation than the previous one according to Radio Free Europe/Rádio Svoboda.
About 300 people met at 8:00 a.m., some streets had to be closed for transportation.
Demonstrators in front of the government played a theatre scene in which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Boris and Attorney General Ivan Gesev into prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisors, President Rumen Radeva, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
Both resignations are part of the basic requirements of protestors.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The protest organiser Nikolai Hadjigenov said today in a public broadcast that on Wednesday there is a "top of escalation" in the form of "national demonstrations in Sofia and blockade across the country".
He repeated the request for the resignation of Boris and his government, as well as the election of early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov had already told us that it was inappropriate to resign.
This was due, inter alia, to the need to make Bulgaria a pandemic of covida-19 and an economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he switched five members of his government team, so that the protestor's retreat would not calm down.
At the beginning of this week, the Boris government stopped voting in Parliament on confidence in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovič no longer wants a game without audiences
The football coach Boloni Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough games of the Italian League without audiences.
Serbian coach hopes to return from the new season with fans to the stadiums.
"What we're running here right now is not football.
I've got a lot of teeth playing games without the audience.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotions, no joy.
The fights are worse than training.
It's terrible to play like this, and I think I'm not the only one who thinks that," Mihajlovič said before the game against Lecca today.
After the coronavir break, they follow the match of Series A in a rapid sequence, and although they play until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play in a terrible heat every three days.
Under conditions like this, you don't even know how the teams are.
For this season to end.
These measures had to be taken to win the competition, but I hope that from September they will be fans back," said the coach, who led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovič, this season is also unusual because four months were missing from the bench due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the league's break and everyone else has managed to move our team to a higher level.
We want to grow further and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We've become the target of foreign cyberattacks, Iran claims.
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials said that the fire that broke out in underground nuclear operations in Natanz this month could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Speaking to Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Abbás Musavi told journalists according to Iranian media that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic daily faces "thousands of cyber attacks".
He added that it was not a new phenomenon and that most of them could be reflected.
Several broader cyber attacks have been recorded in the past months, according to Musavi, followed by "defined governments and groups".
However, the closer details of the possible perpetrators were not reported by Reuters.
He must also have added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in summer.
The articles of the Iranian State Agency IRNA this month discussed that the enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the United States, could have been behind recent incidents.
However, neither of these countries was directly charged with the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tensions between the two countries intensified in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 Iran-World Power Agreement and imposed sanctions against Iran which have a severe impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US Army on 3 January killed Iran's General Kasem Solejmani and a member of the leadership of the Iraqi militias Abu Mahdi Muhandis.
On January 8th, Iran set fire to a base in Iraq where Americans, a number of rockets, operate.
The U.S. admitted that dozens of U.S. soldiers had been injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its chief enemy and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
The TPCA car extended the production surplus, now until 25 May.
The railway car Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) renewed production rate due to coronavir.
Production lines should be restarted on Monday, May 25, morning.
The lead will accompany dozens of hygienic measures, said the speaker car Tomáš Paroubek.
Production is due to the Coronavir pandemic since the evening of 18 March.
Originally, the company intended to restore it on Monday, May 18.
According to Parobka, the reason for the extension is closed borders and closed dealers, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will be producing 100 percent from the start, two shifts.
Key business markets such as Italy, the United Kingdom, or Spain are affected by the Koronavir.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (change for Cologne) said that the production surplus in TPCA is not signed on life in the city.
"In the beginning it was known, it was empty in the city.
But it's gradually filling the street, especially since Monday, when it's been a lot of loose ends.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with the foreign workers who stayed in the hostels.
"In the two months we didn't have to solve almost no problem," Kaspar said.
For example, the Young Boleslav Škoda Auto, which also stopped production due to the coronavir crisis, resumed it on Monday, April 27, in all its three production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the races work at 100 percent of the capacity.
The reconstruction of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On Monday night, on Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiná for the first time after the renewal of the production.
In TPCA, around 2,500 people currently work, and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also the employer in Cologne.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to the family
More than two years she's been fighting Gemma Sisson's cancer, and when it seemed like she'd beat the cancer, the disease's back up again.
A 19 - year - old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospital bed, where she still had to take her life’s love.
Unfortunately, I can't give in.
A few hours after she died, a shocking message appeared on her social security account.
Gemma Sisson, from English Leeds, loved culture.
His friend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, was traveling through competitions all over the world.
A 19-year-old woman was a sportsman and lived a healthy life, yet cancer was diagnosed in April 2018.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, hoping she'd recover.
After months of treatment it really seemed that Gemma managed to win the cancer, but in August 2019 the cancer returned and this time the spine attacked.
According to British daily Daily Mirror, a culture coach and personal trainer underwent a 10-hour spine surgery and subsequently resumed a drastic treatment.
Of course, everything was in vain.
At the beginning of this year, on her ninth birthday, the doctors announced to her that she had a few months to live.
Finally, in April, a handsome blonde decided to join a hospital in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma for the last time on their two-month anniversary at a restaurant.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after she died, a contribution appeared on her social network account that Gemma wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be glad to get rid of what this terrible illness has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky, who was by my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network with the pain and suffering finally stopping and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all of my social network monitors," she wrote, saying that everyone should respect their lives and live it full.
Art Automats sell a sweat list, an amulet made of mushrooms and pexeso
For a hundred crowns he will get a passing pocket work by most of the beginning Czech artists.
The pictures and other designs are designed directly for the art, so they know that they have to fit in the size of 8.5 to 5.5 centimetres.
Every piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always curatorial text in packaging about the artist and then the work itself," explained project curator Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
Buyers can be so surprised at what art they get.
Currently, it can become the new owner of a fantastic illustration by Alexandra Štoplová or a mini-view by Teresa Bonaventur, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Dutkov has prepared a pexeso associated with the walk of Prague.
Cards need to be paired with the birthmarks.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliana Chomová sells pocket packages of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the embroidery and hanging cards, the second series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritistka.
Pay in health care will rise by up to five percent next year.
The greater increase, according to Vojtěch, is unrealistic.
Health payments could rise by up to five percent next year, said Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Václav Moravce in Czech Television.
The requirement of experts to increase up to 15 per cent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective assistance.
Hospitals, according to him, now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase in wages may be somewhere up to five percent," said the minister.
According to him, the current situation needs to be reflected in which it has been involved since March in the selection of the Coronavir Insurance pandemic and the government regulation against its spread.
The insurance revenues were down at the time.
"At 15 percent I find the increase now unrealistic," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly salary of a physician in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (USIS) is likely to reach 88,312 kroner this year, nurses 47,498 kroner.
The difference between the salaries of nurses in state hospitals and the pay for other founders will be up to 7,000 crowns.
Data from the SIS also indicate that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34 125 CZK in 2019 according to the data of the Czech Statistical Office.
Professional representatives already stated in June that a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent, would be required for 2021.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be governed by pay tables and contractual wages in urban, regional or private hospitals.
They therefore also require that the pay tables be uniform for healthcare professionals.
For nurses this year, there will be a difference of up to seven thousand crowns per month.
In doctors, for example, wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to President Roman Šmucler, experts should be aware of the state's current situation.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's deficit to record 500 billion crowns due to the impact of the covid epidemic, of which 1.75 billion are to be paid to hospitals and social services.
The Council of Health Care Providers according to Šmucler disagrees with the general increase in salaries next year.
According to him, hospitals and medical facilities themselves should decide on remuneration, and the money should also go to them through payment orders.
Privates also said that hospitals now have enough protective care.
The President of the State Treasury (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have any health care equipment.
Waiting for the tender to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now better able to deliver goods than in March when they were purchased.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
Squeezing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they're reporting.
"A smart quarantine is working, it's to improve, of course.
We'll discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should again be driving the whole thing," Prime Minister said on Sunday in his Facebook show Chow people.
According to him, IT systems and hygienic stations are not sufficiently connected, which must gradually become more modern operating methods.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister in Moravian Silesia, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, Jan Peshík, for the Czech Republic, said that there was no information on Sunday's negotiations and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army, according to him, is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project took over the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the military as an advisory body of the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Primula.
On Sunday, the moving project was criticised by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
Even he claimed that he could be reinstated by the army.
The shortcomings in the project had previously been granted by the government authority for IT and digitalisation Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
"The system works, but it's still working on it.
Twenty years, it's been created on its own, and it's not systemic, and now in a few months, we're trying to unify it.
It can't be a blast.
People on the march, poor people on hygiene for the march adapt these new systems and actually catch up with the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava's Prime Minister Macura won't run again, because he doesn't want to "ditch in politics"
The current Ostrava-Prime Minister Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort to "do not delve into politics," said Respect.cz server.
Macura, also a member of the Presidency of the ANO Movement, has been the prime minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, it was won by the leading candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava by nearly a third of the voter votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I would last a period of office and with this business experience I could turn everything around and build on my feet," Respek said.
He added that during the second election period he had been allowed to negotiate to some extent.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to fool myself in politics," Macura added, who in the interview described himself as a difficult introvert that doesn't fit in with frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, he has been speculating for a long time about Macur's possible end in the YES movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticised the ANO movement, such as the SPD movement or the support of Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities, ANO supported the election of Zeman's anti-candidate Jiří Drahoš.
Macura is not planning to leave the ANO movement in 2017.
"Until I feel that I can change something in my movement, that this is not a completely futile fight, and that no one makes a difference to me, I have no immediate motive to end it," Respek said.
He graduated from the School of Economics in Prague in the sixth grade of the 15-year-old Macura.
Macura, among other things, served as director of Walmark’s pharmaceutical company before becoming Ostrava’s prime minister in 2014.
He also met with other companies.
The Uber offering transport services will return to Brno
At the end of July, Uber will return to Brno, which offers transport services.
It is a consequence of the amendment of the law, said on Thursday in a press statement by Councilman Brno for transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
They protested against Uber in Brno, pointed out that Uber does not meet conditions such as a taxi or taximeter.
However, since July, the conditions for operating ordinary taxis and alternative taxis have changed by law.
In recent weeks, he has held several meetings with representatives of Uber.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is the result of an amendment to the law that allows this company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits," Kratochev said.
Uber acted in Brno in the past.
They protested against him by taxi drivers for not marking vehicles like a taxi or missing taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary ruling prohibiting Uber from riding in the city.
Brno originally supported the taxi driver, but last year's premiere Markéta Váňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company didn't use it.
He will now return on the basis of a change of law.
Since July, it has been assumed that it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications in addition to conventional taxis with a lamp and a taximeter.
Too big a celebration in Brno: flying chairs fell meters from man on the sidewalk
On Saturday evening, an office chair flew out of the fourth floor of the apartment and fell about a foot from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a walker who immediately called the guards.
Immediately after arriving at that address in the western part of the city, the guard noticed an open window that still had chairs and several cans and burners next to it.
"The movement that came from the room in the fourth floor indicated that a rather loud celebration was taking place inside.
The officers went out into the hallway to the apartment and asked three present young men from the age of twenty-six to twenty-nine years for an explanation," said Officer James Ghan, a spokesman.
The request to appeal Rafaj will discuss Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss the request to appeal to the head of the Antimonopoly Office (UOHS) of Petr Rafaj on Monday with the coalition social Democrats.
Rafiah's appeal was called by non-profit organisations at meetings of the Anti-Corruption Council of the Government as well as the Ustecky Region.
Social Democrats say the exchange is in place at the head of the office.
According to CTK Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second mandate will end in the middle of next year, by law he cannot be appointed a third.
His appeal is within the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústecká Region.
Among other things, Rafaj's bails are due to be in recent times.
In the past week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request that the materials would be made known and that the government would take a "no opinion" to that effect.
He also pointed out that he had not yet dealt with the challenges with the President; he had no appointment with him in the near future.
According to the UOHS's statement of appeal, there is no reason because Rafaj was not accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálno.cz wrote last week that the police were interested in Rafaj's meeting with Heitman Jiří Čunk.
The meetings included, among other things, deciding on the competition for the project of controversial the new Vlín hospital for eight billion, which Chechnya strongly promotes.
He said that they were working together on his "senary activities".
Rafaj also speaks.
The representative of the Ústice Region called on the government at the end of June to appeal to Rafaj.
It also requests reform of the Authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The UOHS decision on public contracts according to Deputy Heitman for the transport of Jaroslav Komínka is not transparent and has signs of its own.
Last March, the police interfered with the antimonopoly office because of the mythist tender.
This June, then server News.cz pointed out that Rafaj was using the flats written on the company of influential backstage player ČSSD Alexandra Chuby.
An advance of 3.5 million per apartment in Brno was paid from Rafael's account.
Rafaj has been President of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, and for the second term of office, the President of the former Member of Social Democracy appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafael's second six-year mandate expires.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may only be withdrawn if it does not perform a function for more than six months or seriously impairs the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Authority.
In the Blonde Library, the workers were collapsing with heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740 000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we regularly go to a library in downtown Blanca.
In warm months, however, it was practically impossible to endure.
There was a lot of heat and bad air.
Venture didn't help.
That's why I like air conditioning," said one of the blannese readers Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Propy’s temperature in the building has often risen to over 30 degrees.
The southern wall of the object is glass and in sunny days it functions as a greenhouse.
"The sun also rests for much of the day due to the curve of the building.
At the same time, there is a big problem with the individual department to wind up because overnight it has to be closed for security reasons.
Often that's how we've been in the library since this morning to thirty degrees," Propa said.
The worst was the studio and the third floor.
And then on the floor, there's the exhibition room and the director.
The climate was also unpleasant in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"A few times it happened that librarians at work were collapsing and ended up in labor incompetence.
The problem was also regularly experienced in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was no longer possible to breathe there," observed Propa.
Originally, city representatives wanted to do air conditioning this year in all the library premises.
In the end, there'll be only three circuits out of five.
"For limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most problematic spaces.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
In addition, the cultural room and the children's department are higher on the floor," informed Jiří Svoboda of the blann investment department.
He added that at the first stage, workers in the autumn of the year had installed the aircraft in the space mentioned above and had repaired the electrical installation.
Approximately 300,000 crowns.
The City Library of Blanco has almost three thousand registered readers.
It's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.

Crawford's back in the game
Not everyone who's infected with sportsmen will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to a NHL player who is silent about the health status of players as a grave and does not disclose anything.
As one of the few stepped out of Crawford's line.
A 15-year-old family member from Montréal was only present at the first training session, and he has been missing since.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and that is why I have spent the last 14 days locked up in my house," explained the reason for my absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford's ready to go back to full load.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible," I added.

Thousands protested against the prime minister in Israel
Thousands of Israelis in several places have protested against unemployment, corruption, and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu solves the crisis with coronavir.
The demonstrations took place, among other things, before Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in the park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding the resignation of Netanya because of the process in which they are accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the government's handling the next outbreak of coronavir.
"Bibi, go home," according to AP, wrote one of the demonstrators to his banner, referring to Netanyhu's commonly known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the Emperor has lost his dress," stood on another.
Netanyahu, 70, is Israel’s first prime minister in office.
He is accused of three acts of corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust.
All charges are dismissed and marked as hunting witches.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, over 300 witnesses are summoned.
Coronavius SARS-CoV-2 confirmed itself in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, with almost 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped to reduce the daily increase of infected ones.
After the gradual release of restrictions since the end of April, however, in particular, the number of infected again increased significantly at the end of June.
Netanyahu’s critics argue that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, the barbers affected by quarantine measures.
It is also a problem for protestors that the government has issued controversial guidelines in the context of the fight against coronavir.

Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is made a major change in the strategy.
It breaks off the discounts and doesn't want to churn one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the largest environmental polluters is not new.
Incinerators and landfills, billions of pieces of clothing end each year.
The view of the slow fascion, often disdained approach to dress, has changed relatively quickly over the past few years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold because of the discounts, simply won't buy.
The company does not want to christen one collection by the other and at the end of each season, to lower products below their production price.
In addition, according to owner Michal Mitchka, the era of new and old collections and blind follow rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most merchants with discounts are already counting when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
It's actually a bit of a scam," says the owner of Pietro Filipi Michal Michčka.
In addition, with its approach, the company wants to support local business as well.
"Every product is made of carefully selected quality materials and designed by local designers.
We stress that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called bass pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and overseasonal.
Worldwide there is a segment of premium brands without any discounts typical, the product price simply corresponds to its quality and therefore there is no need for discount," Mička adds.
Giant graffiti represents RAF Kurt Taussiga flyers
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was well liked," said Vacek, who completed his work after 14 days of intensive creation.
He used about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother succeeded in avoiding concentration camp because of Nicholas Winton’s organization.
In 1939, Taussig joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in Great Britain, and then completed his pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine in Africa.
He engaged in combat operations early in 1945.
After the velvet revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and Teplice natives, who gave him an honourable citizenship.
The six-year-old Kamil Vacek, who has been known by people in the field of graphic art by the name of Camo, has been spraying in heat streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the areas that Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) then appointed.
Hanna's storm has arrived on the coast of Texas.
Hurricane Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon at local time (before midnight SELČ for the night) on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas.
It hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometres north of Port Mansfield, and in its motion over the mainland, weakened on a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses great dangers for coastal residents.
It brought with it strong wind and intense precipitation; together with local floods, power failures and various material damage, including damage to ships, have been reported, according to AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced a state of natural disaster on Saturday for 32 districts in south-west Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warnings were given by people from the coastline between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay Bay Bay, but they were expected to hit the area almost 500 kilometres long before moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous tides and unique tornadoes may pose a threat," warned the U.S. National Centre for Hurricanes (NHC).
This morning, the local time (afternoon SELČ) was moving in the area of the American-Mexican border and accompanied by a wind speed of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic area on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico it was driven by wind at a speed of up to 145 kilometres per hour, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometres per hour in the process, depriving Hanna of the hurricane category.
The local authorities called for storms to cross home and not forget the hygiene measures associated with prevention against the spread of coronavir.
Texas is one of the Americas that the pandemics of covid-19 disease are plagued by the most.
Given the existing security measures and the need to comply with the derogations, it is also a major challenge to evacuate.
The sightseeing shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas Hidalgo district, one of the buildings was also identified as shelters for evacuated people who had a positive test for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to diseases.
Local authorities have called on all evacuated people to take gloves and disinfection gels with them, if possible.
"We still don't have it far behind.
We are expecting catastrophic flooding," said AP Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
In some places, predictions suggest that it could spray up to 300 millimetres of precipitation within a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimetres, which together with rising sea levels could flood a number of seaside seats.
Zeman will lend General's rank to Colonel Lipkovi
President Miloš Zeman will lend the general rank of Colonel Paul Lipkov on Wednesday.
This is due to the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for borrowing the dignity of the Brigadier General is the August accession of Lipka to the post of Deputy Commander of the Allied Multinational Division of the Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as the commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
Zeman's promotion at the end of June was proposed by the government.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl Řehku in the position of Deputy Commander of the Multinational Northeast Division in the Polish Elblag, who leads the units of the Alliance's forward presence in the territory of Poland and Pobaltí.
In March, he became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Office (NÚKIB).
The government has proposed to the President to lend Lipkov the dignity of the Brigadier General.
According to the Employment Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the duration of his or her term of office or for the duration of his or her service assignment, which requires the promotion of a higher rank.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division corresponds to the general rank.
The soldier to whom the rank was lent has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to this rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that corresponds to the dignity.
The loan of the rank shall remain pending the omission of the reason for which it has been granted.
"Colonel Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
In a significant way, it participates in the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the military in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on a proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, attended by Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygienic standards for aircraft travel to help reduce the spread of new coronavir.
This was announced by the German Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is respect for the distance or handling of dust in the aircraft and at the airport, but the mid-air seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported it.
"I am pleased that my colleagues adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that officials had concluded the agreement and that it had to be formally approved by the Ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from six years of age, to comply with the recommended distance from security controls and airport clearance.
Airplanes must also have sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
Aerolinks will also be able to accommodate midway seats.
The common rules on which officials have agreed to comply with at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
The Arctic Špicberkeh had a temperature record, measuring almost 22 degrees
"In Longyearbyen, a 41-year-old record has fallen," said the Norwegian Meteorological Institute on Twitter.
In the middle, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, thus surpassing the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees.
About two-thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Špicberkeh, located about 1300 kilometers from the north pole.
The spikes heat up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the danger arising from the warming of other Arctic areas - from Alaska to Siberia, the Norwegian Climate Research Centre reports last year.
The average temperature in Špicberk seems to have risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it can rise by as much as ten degrees unless greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere.
The rise of temperature in Špicberk may result in permanent freezing of soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can also cause more lava and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or seals, which depend on the ocean’s ice cover.
The British who return from Spain are waiting for a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet of Citizens also called for the risk of spreading disease covid-19 to avoid all roads to mainland Spain that are not necessary.
The Canary Islands and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, and after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
"Protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have adopted this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," British diplomacy stated in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that if we need to, we will immediately remove a country from the list of those who are safe," she added.
As the British Metro noted, the latest announcement will affect thousands of British travel plans.
Spain is one of the most popular vacation destinations.
The British are concerned, among other things, that the sick will be paid if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a ten - day vacation in Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
The tour has been ordered since December.
"We had to go to the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, I don't know what's going to happen after this announcement.
I work as a train driver, and I don't think my employer will assume that after returning from my leave for two weeks in quarantine," the daily Metro Hunter quoted me as saying.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the last two days, over 900 newly infected people have always been there in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas have already tightened coronavir measures, such as Catalonia, trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently raised the risk of disease in Catalonia, Aragon, Basque and Madrid.
The model of the purchase of electricity from Dukovan is under discussion by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of Dukovana Nuclear Power Plant.
The draft law provides that if the buying-in price is higher than the price of power on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, where the buying-in price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be reversed.
The power supply is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for the customers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havelíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save because of the construction for electricity.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on markets is always uncertain, which has shown a number of developments in the past.
The intention had previously been criticized by environmental organisations.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power.
The final impact at the time of application of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact shall be spread between customers according to the size of the fuse - at lower consumption or electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the background to the material.
Havelíček said in May that he assumed that the wholesale price of electricity would increase and the people of Dukovan would make money.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns per year on the family, which he believes is far less than that in the electricity invoices per year to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the ransom price could be between 50 and 60 euro (about 1320 CZK to 1600 CZK) per megawatthoin (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any proposal for an amount, to be included only in the ransom contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for the year 2021, at which merchants are now the most stocked, is currently around 45 euro (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"In contrast to the buying-in price and market prices of the power plant of €10, an average household allowance of 3,3 MWh per year could correspond to four separate households, standardly equipped with electric appliances including electric hobs and ovens, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and heating hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," it wrote in the supporting documents for the government of MPO.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavir pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecast of market prices to be a speculative matter," said ČTK, formerly executive director of the Energy Finance Group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law assumes that the redemption would be carried out by the MPO, with respect to it by a legal person owned by the State at a predetermined price.
A contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, including a repeated, but not longer than the end of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design is defined as a nuclear power plant connected to an electrical system with a installed capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havelíček previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have a power of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthodin electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into service in 2036.
The funding model for the new Dukovan block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed on a non-recurrent basis, with a two-percent interest in operation.
The funding model does not agree with the opposition, and it also prevents Dukovany from building Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should be involved in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should pay ČEZ, which will also pay any additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Beneš said in May of the Czech Republic that the expected sum for building the block at current prices is about six billion euro (about 162 billion CZK).
Contracts between the State and ČEZ on the construction of a new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development downloaded the two billion-billion-dollar tourism support material in the media
The material planned by the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) to spend in the media, on the internet and billboards for holiday advertising on two billion crowns in the Czech Republic has been withdrawn by the Office from the notice procedure.
Minister Klára Dostalová (for ANO) server ListNews.cz said that the material is still working.
The eKlep document (Electronic Library of the Legislative Process) was notified on Friday by the server Zpravy.cz.
The Ministry's plan caused the collapse of travel traffic due to coronavir.
During the coronavir crisis, the media have also experienced a decline in income.
The proposal sparked criticism of the opposition and representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now to be viewed on the website glidacstat.cz, the MMR planned to give money to Czech Tourism through the state agency to promote tourism in television, radio, print, internet, billboard or station areas.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would get TV.
Most of them would get private TVs from Nova and Prima.
Printed diaries and weeks would get 400 million and the same part would give the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of which again private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used on outdoor billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or in subways.
The tourism support campaign in the Czech Republic was scheduled to start in mid-August and last the year.
"It is still working on the material, it is definitely not in the form it should be presented yet," said Dostalová without further details of the List of Messages server.
The material criticized the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, the Marquet of Pekarová Adamová would benefit from advertising media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this showy contempt will get in the fall by the election wound between the eyes," she wrote on twitter.
In fact, the recipient refuses to accept that it is to help the media in crisis.
"It could also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," Denik N said on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course we're still counting, it could be less and more.
It's working material," she added.
Initiatives to save tourism do not give a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," President Tomáš Barčík announced on Sunday.
If those two billion crowns are found in the state budget, they should be directed at companies, not the media, the initiative is written in an open letter to the government.
A product from life, cocoon beer and death like a stalk of grass
The third album entitled A Death is the stem of the grass of the poet of Brno, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Friče, who also left a year ago, on 24 May.
In Frič's discography, the fifth item is the fifth item and the same as in previous titles, and here is the main focus on Frič's poetry, which is an outstanding interpreter.
Fric, the year 1949, was obviously influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was passed through its own personal experiences and also very intimate expressions of faith.
Of course, some agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, was always very intimate, unaggressive, completely tolerant.
In this context, I think of Bohuslav Reynek (as opposed to Jan Zahradníčku), the masters of the promiscuity.
Frič's album offers records of authorial reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensibly, whether he was a cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Bartonň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - I would love - the words of Ostrava's poet Peter Hrushka about Frič's long poems.
"The proud and unending bitterness of them burned," writes Hrushka, "over the condition of our world threatened by doom.
The world, which is increasingly falling into insufferable consumer vanity and bravery, is increasingly moving away from what his soul was created from the secret of faith, humility and human proximity.
There was a gust in them of the one who knows that the values for whom he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that only because of the general lack of interest can they be denied.
The poems reminded us that a person may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how he loses it.
If he sells himself to a general failure, he skeptically gives up, shuts up, or stays quiet and proud of what he believes and loves until the last moment."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and President Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The President of the Party and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
The hamster said it on the Prima Party TV show today.
About Paroubek being a Hamaczek advisor, the ListNews server informed on Friday.cz.
"Sometimes we'll write a text, he'll send me some material and I'll read it," Hamaček said today.
He added, however, that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the ČSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, so many people are like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Chernoch, the Minister said that many ODS members still "listen to the opinions of Václav Klaus.
It seems to him that it is all right because it is an experienced policy and an ex-president of the party, which is also the case of Paroubka.
The fact that they're making an affair out of this media has marked this year's pickle season.
Server ListNews.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the Petr Bend cell, who is associated with Parubek, headed by the Vice-President of his LEV party, is heading for the fourth post of the party candidate in the oral region.
The hamster said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile ahead, it's a kick in the ass, there's a Swede's challenger.
Just a 22-year-old American sticker has ambition and potential to belong to the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like for two years to beat the younger Duplantis, he beat him at the NCAA University association party last year.
"We had a battle a year before, when he and I were second, then we threw it away.
In both cases it was a very good fight," describes Nilsen, who secured the victory by a 5.95 meter.
But since then, Duplantis has fired a steep fire and is currently found alone in the highest barbers.
In just 20 years he became a world recorder, this February 8th in Toruna overcame a line of 6.17 metres, a week later in Glasgow another centimetre.
"He's been jumping six meters since he graduated from high school," he remembers his associate Nilsen for the World Athletics web.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up with a boy in a man, all his potential and talent multiplied.
Twenty years is quite a good age to jump the world record," he believes.
Although Nilsen's number of successes is thinner than the one proud of Duplantis, the American has similar goals.
He indicated his options so far at NCAA races, which he regularly won, this year in February, he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won gold medals at pan-American games in Lima, already in 2017 he made his way to the American World Championship Tour, where he ended 13.
The nearest milestone then is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It is definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League as you can because there you can make a name," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events such as the Olympics, the World Cup or the Pan-American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and others time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily race under five circles turn into just a silver fight?
"Everyone is trying to reach it, but I don't think it will be possible in the near future," Nilsen ponders.
"That kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile ahead of him in practice."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, he's going to want to raise it even more.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands of people on the disability pension of the incapacitated son.
There's a trial waiting for her.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzlement, a woman up to eight years in prison is threatened.
Because of poor health, the court dismissed the sick man’s integrity and established his mother as a guardian, who was to manage his son’s money, among other things.
"The woman used part of her son's disability pension for her needs from mid-November 2013 until January 2013 and prepared him for 440,000 crowns," police spokesman Dana Ladman said, with the accused harassing the accused woman that she had a special obligation as guardian to defend the interests of the injured person.
The woman, according to the court's orders, had set up an account for her son, but her pension had to be sent to her account.
"After paying for the expenses associated with the stay of the son in the medical facility and the payment of the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of the vehicle, electric appliances and for the journey of the household," he said.
That he couldn't use his son's money for his own use, the woman confessed.
But she was arguing about helping them pay family expenses.
"We had problems with our incomes to tighten the pace of the household.
We've never bought anything out of the ordinary.
It was always for things whose son would approve.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists claim to have found tools
The findings of the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican State of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could have served as pests or spears.
Scientists have discovered that the oldest instruments come from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But there they are," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies that were published on this subject in Nature magazine.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, the people of the Chiquihuite cave, located at a large altitude, stayed for 20,000 years.
So far, a generally accepted theory has said that the first representatives of the genus Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from the area of today’s Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique spikes of spears used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this human culture subsequently spread to much of North America.
This model, however, has gained a rift over the past decades when several early settlements have been discovered, two to three thousand years older.
In a second study published in the journal Nature, 42 different locations throughout North America show human presence on the continent from 26 000 to 19 000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American mainland before it was assumed to be.
Some of them could have gotten into America by boat.
"It is obvious that the people of America were long before the development of so-called clown culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Canada in Alberta.
The interest in tickets so far is filled with an optimistic scenario, says salesmen.
Prices are also decreasing gradually
Flight sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Although last year’s interest is still about half, demand increases by up to 20 percent each week.
The development after the crisis thus fills out the most unoptimistic scenarios according to the sellers.
Flight prices are also decreasing gradually.
The most sought-after destinations include South European countries according to vendors in particular.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At the Letuska.cz portal, the most sold are flights to Croatian Split.
From other countries, however, the most sought - after United Kingdom is one of the most difficult destinations ever.
The average flight price is also decreasing.
At the Letuska portal.cz it was around 6250 crowns in half a month, with 3,000 crowns less per year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for a European destination, which now accounts for about 85 per cent of sales.
However, the prices themselves are dropping to some European places, such as Spain or Italy in the past weeks, by about a fifth.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets with much less advance than before, as they fear further development of the coronavir situation.
According to previous information Kiwi.com, the flight time before departure decreased by about ten days per year.
"This confirms the future trend for people to order tickets with a much smaller advance, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice President for Kiwi.com products Michal Šindelár.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth of sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is rising.
At the Prague airport, there are currently regular links to more than 60 destinations.
Last summer season is about half of the destinations.
Big finals tonight!
Follow the swinging battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC has reached the grand finale.
It introduces an experienced 40-year-old Scottish singer Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, a six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson in the first round disabled Justin Pipa, then bumped into his neighbor on a chart board.
However, James Wade and his husband also consulted, and in the quarterfinals he had been able to fight Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home a world-class one.
"Flying Scot" was near the semifinal when he was facing Michael Smith.
At the last minute, however, he fled the tomb out of the shovel, in an extension he dominated and after the result 18:16 he fought a place in the finals of the tournament, which he had already ruled in 2018, when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensura Suljovice 21:19.
The biggest surprise of the World Match is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and it may well be that it has nothing to lose, it has helped him to play the absolutely fantastic wave.
The six-year-old singer first surprised Nathan Aspinall's world's six, beat Joe Cullen into a dramatic battle, and also conquered Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinals after a sharp onset.
The big test was semifinal.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength to the introduction, but in peace playing the Belgian then gained an excellent series, which then held on to the end with no difficulty at all.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high score, which he encountered occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavir cases occurred at least from the beginning of the week, the number of tests decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, 5,254 people are sick.
This is based on data from the Ministry of Health's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times by two hundred.
Maxim was on Friday's 281 cases.
On Thursday, 235 were tested positive, 246 days earlier and on Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
Nine,590 people have been cured in the Czech Republic, 63 percent of all people infected so far.
Most of them had a mild disease.
In the hospital, according to recent data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavir are considered to be serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days in the conversion to 100,000 inhabitants is still reported by Karvinsko, almost 59.
The district of Jihlava follows with 56 and Frydecko-Městěcko with 36 infected with 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
New measures against the spread of coronavir have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday due to an increased number of infected patients.
People have to wear gloves at internal mass events of over 100 people, it's cultural and sporting events, but it's also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
Since Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the current 1,000 people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been infected with the new coronavir has already exceeded the limit of 16 million.
This was introduced by the American University of Johns Hopkins, who is following the development of the pandemic globally.
The casualties that died with covid-19 are approaching 645,000 according to this source.
The latest million infected came to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million border fell on July 22.
The largest share in the rapid increase in the number of cases has been recorded in recent days by the United States, which has already registered more than 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where almost 1.4 million people have been infected by authorities.
The infected are now at a record rate.
The World Health Organization reported this week that from Thursday to Friday more than 284,000 new cases worldwide, the highest daily balance since the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top of the human states, such as the USA, Brazil and India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases has increased in almost 40 countries around the world in the past week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Israel.
The disease has already emerged in almost all countries of the world, the first case today has been officially announced by the KLDR.
The air in households is five times worse than outdoors.
Health damage to air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in outdoors but also at home.
She drew attention to this by Israeli health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who deserved the establishment of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, household damage needs to be addressed right now as many people spend more time working from home.
Abrahamová mentioned the research of the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of home air is up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die annually because of poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of an epidemic of coronavir, which has forced many and is still forcing people to work from home, people must spend more hours in their homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of the air in their homes," said Abraham.
In Israel, she says, almost no one deals with quality "domestic air".
Dangerous, however, may be things with which a person normally comes into contact with - coats, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poison gas also produces clothing that we regularly wear in the cleaners," said Abraham.
The most endangered are her children, elderly family members, and people with respiratory problems.
Even otherwise, healthy individuals may start to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergy.
Internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged by long-term exposure to unhealthy substances.
Not all the damage, however, comes from objects inside the home, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.

Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
Dominic's daughter discovered it.
"Dad didn't have him for many years," she told Aha! the eldest daughter of Gott Dominic with the fact that the Master couldn't come to Havla's name and whenever the speech came to him, said Karla always upset.
It's hard to say what they've done, but according to Dominica, the dispute started in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in a post-revolution article that he was easier at it than he was.
That Havel could write in a drawer in a dark time, but if he had any resistance, he would have ended his career," Gott claims.
But it adds that after all, the Czech giants have found a way.
"I know the word Havel couldn't hear in his 60s at all.
But then the president congratulated him on his birthday letter, and suddenly my father's relationship with him began to change," says Dominika.
Ten years later, even Gott invited the former president to celebrate his seventyth at the Ambassador Hotel in Václav Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because Mr. Havla's father then regularly invited Mr. Havla to his home on Bertram," added the blonde whose father died in October last year.
It is also said that it was a shame that Václav Havel never received a state honour.
However, he was expecting him in 2009, even though it was already from the hands of his successor in the function of Václav Klaus (79).
Another honor awaits the memorial, the current President Miloš Zeman (75) is to give him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
