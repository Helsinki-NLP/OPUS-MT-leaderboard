Barack Obama gets as America's fourth president of the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in the Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth American president in history.
Diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million will be paid for, among other things, an exceptional effort to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
Chief of the White House will arrive at Norwegian metropolis in the morning with both Michelle's wife and will be busy.
First, he is invited to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee, which he was selected from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The President's couple then scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonjo.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in the ceremonial ceremony that Obama takes on the prestigious awards.
He will receive it as the fourth American president, but only the third to receive the price directly in office.
The White House has already promoted that Obama will speak of the Afghan War when taking the prize.
The President does not want to avoid this because he realizes that he takes the price as a president who currently fights in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago has even increased by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to stress any of his critics.
At Obama’s ceremony he will also receive gold medals, diplomas and check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He's going to put you for charity, but he hasn't decided on a particular charity yet.
The programme will then lead the President to a banquet with him, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, there will also be a ministerial president and 250 other guests invited.
Obama was rather slow from the start to the price.
He pointed out, for example, that he feels that he does not deserve it fully.
He also repeated that it was not only for him, but for all who sought the same value as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said he was "calling for action".
Nature's Protector charged with blackmail
The Lithuanian police accused the chairman of the civil society of the Litoměřice Nature Conservation Company of extortion.
In some cases, in the past year, he appealed to certain construction procedures, demanding money from investors for his benefit, said Lithuanian police spokesman Alena Romová.
The head of the literary Society of Nature Protectors is Lubomír Studnička.
Now he's in custody and he's going to be in prison for up to three years.
The class containers of Brno don't smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can keep their drinks out of wraps, and in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at each step.
And in Brno?
There to reserve a few minutes before you find the right dumpster.
I don't want to say that there's no clean-up at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic, the councilors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest waste sorting league not only because as citizens here we can still throw paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but especially the number of dumplings on such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing PET bottles into a collection basket in the center?
It's a done piece of shit, especially it takes time and nerve.
The only place I've hit so far is in Moravian square across from Potrefena Husa.
Don't be mad at me, Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but I don't think it's a damn thing.
Not to mention that even in other parts there is no sorting of waste honey.
A bunch of my friends don't like to clean up the trash like that.
From the sloth.
They've got a long way to go to the dumpsters.
I don't blame them.
I offered myself after the party to throw out some glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored dumpsters in sight on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I ran into the right place on the way to the scarf.
However, waste flowed from it.
It's still the center of Brno, which is probably the city's most representative, isn't it?
But ecology and some aesthetics don't seem to care much about Brno socialists.
Those cities will rather buy a hockey extra to make us shame across the Republic than buy some extra containers and offer sorting of other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could confirm the official statistics after a moment of web crawling.
According to ECO-KOM, Brno is the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
"Parube" budget took money for retirement and sickness
After adding the left to the government’s view to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sickness or construction savings.
But also interest on state debt or international litigation.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists promoted the promotion of certain groups, they believed that the government would lend additional money, pensions or sickness. "It is just a postponement of problems to the future, a laying of mines," Janota said.
Money borrowed is paying ever higher interest and must sometimes return.
There's not much choice to make.
If it does not reduce the social benefits or costs of running the state, it must raise taxes.
To all the left-handers she's added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later to their children.
Pensions or sicknesses, out of which $1.8 billion has disappeared, people don't have to worry about, they get them.
However, at the cost of becoming more indebted – next year it will not be missing in the treasury only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow more quickly and with him and the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or reduce maternity, as the government has done in its anti-defective package.
Money transfers in favour of several groups of voters will also cost five billion to build highways and railways next year.
It is mainly already competitive and disassembled sections that can be redesigned and, where appropriate, decrepit.
Mostly book, which is also not free.
This means delay or suspension of thirty large buildings, and the drawing of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Karel Hanzelka Transport Ministry.
The ČSSD suggested that the money cut out would resolve the shalamunsky – it will reach out to ČEZ dividends, which the state of most of its own, and it will cover the transport fund from them.
The problem is, the amount of dividends is never sure, and it's not a bottomless source at all.
Last year CEZ joined the budget of 18 billion.
Every year, the dividends are paid for the liquidation of environmental damage, they are supplemented by a pension account or are used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick under EU rules increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, this does not end the carnival of movements.
Nearly three billion have been left in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime or for expenses incurred in court disputes, even for construction proceedings.
If he gets around without that money, he's not sure.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, according to Janota.
Then the minister will have to save money inside the resort or at worst touch the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing from the already open two-billion-dollar Treasury project, which is designed to allow the online monitoring of what individual authorities spend on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance hadn't found the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come up, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
The Americans are counting on a mobile phone, on which the user will press a single button to switch between different operating systems.
Exposed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android within seconds.
This option is the goal of the US company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We'll allow you to run two user profiles on your mobile at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into homework and work.
Both will work at one and the same moment, suggested Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
He was presented in November last year and was first presented a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented to journalists a sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was modified by Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which also ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and customers should get the devices during 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains plagues hoteliers
The holly slopes don't just worry about the Krkonoše climbers.
The missing snow reflects people even from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkonoše it is still possible to find free rooms for all winter terms including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our website.
People are going through offers, they're getting prices, but so far they're afraid to make a commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think they will be in the snow or in the mud this year," said the information portal operator Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants a New Year's Eve stay in Špindler's Mill, according to their own ideas, says he shouldn't hesitate to order any more.
Who gives priority to saving money and the quality of accommodation is at his second place, he can try to wait for a few days.
Spindler hotels offer mainly weekly stays at Silvestra so far.
I think they're going to try to turn them in for a while, but then they're going to let them go for a little while.
And then the free rooms will be quickly beaten," Jandura estimated.
The top-of-the-line travel agency Ingtours offers free beds in all winter terms.
Now we're most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
Half the seats in our offer remain free.
That is why we have already arranged some cheaper Christmas stays for the last minute," said Ingtours Director Petr Schiffert.
Silvestra in Krkonoše can also offer the top-flight travel agency, but there are fewer places available.
The first 14 days in February, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People wait for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the year on the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed during the week, Christmas will be sold out," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec under Sněžko are well established than last year.
We're about five percent better.
We have the last few seats for New Year's Eve and New Year's Eve.
He is very interested in Polish holidays in January and is well sold in February," said the director of the best hotel in Greece Karel Rada.
With 80 percent of them, the hotel of Omnia at the central parking lot in Janské Lázní is occupied with silvestrov’s stays.
On the contrary, at Christmas, half of the free beds remain in the new Janskopaská hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by a January one, which we have at this point is about 60 percent.
A little weaker is February so far, but as soon as the snow invades, the interest in staying in Krkonoše will certainly rise, said the hotel manager Omnia Erik Sporisch.
However, for a larger portion of the snow, the Krkonoše hotels must yet have a taste.
It's supposed to cool down on Thursday if there's any precipitation, so there's supposed to be snow on the mountains.
But then the heat comes again, informs Jiří Jakubský from the castle work of the Czech Institute of Hydrometeorology.
USA: Review is the mother of wisdom
It is quite comical, with which Barack Obama's schooling skills, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his desired Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had described it through a copyist from Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only does the text itself several times use the word turnover "as in Iraq", but it did not even hesitate to use the name Bush's declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward".
In doing so, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military forces to Iraq, enslaved by civil war, as “unresponsible and in its aftermath catastrophic decisions”.
However, the following months have shown that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, has been the only possible and successful enough not to speak at all in the news reports about Iraq today.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, but he left his successor with an objectively more grateful background than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be reversed.
He was again asked by the field commanders to increase military contingent, in particular the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite subordinary custom, severely criticised the weighty shooters in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation to the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't fall for anything better, so at least he cheated on the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to make another five thousand vows, even though he himself originally counted from 10.
The most problematic of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. The whole Obama Doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half the increase will yield the same fruit as the Iraqi procedure.
Despite the killing wars of recent years, the Iraqi society has been relatively well organized, its leader honors the agreement.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied on and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces used to change the master every day according to how they fit.
Political institutions, although formally founded, will remain only a post-mart village for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue.
The balance of interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult given the lack of transparency of the relations that further complicate Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even building an "accelerated state", which is a minimalist target of the whole operation, does not seem too real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is being undermined by its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent to a war cry for the purpose of a "severe return home" cause a miracle here, can only a soul truly romantic, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, the date of the withdrawal of troops is an indemnity, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect confession of the American defeat.
NATO's latest summit has shown that the Europeans' willingness to take part in combat operations in Afghanistan is a negative.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war at the foot of the Hindus.
Another factor capable of radically interfering with the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions on Iran do not work out, a difficult question will arise before the United States whether or not to try to resolve the problem by military force.
It will be necessary to respond to it just at a time when, according to Obama, America will move on to a winning withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turning point in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time to come up with another strategy if this turns out to be a total failure.
The managers of Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash rewards.
The US Bank's senior head Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by a company that reacts to the sharp criticism of its wages practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive instead of the money of the stock, which will be available for sale in five years' time first.
In addition, shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs thus takes the lead in efforts to link rewards to Wall Street with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction to which it needs to be published, has been introduced by the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after taking nearly $17 billion (about $300 billion) for the first three - quarter of this year.
The total amount of remuneration in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion in spite of the announced measure announced today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political topic in a number of countries with the advent of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it intended banknote bonuses of more than 25,000 pounds (about 712,000 CZK) to pay 50 percent tax once.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
The record five women in Stockholm today took over from the hands of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustaf this year's Nobel Prizes in professional categories and literature.
Among them was German writer Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn, and Carol Greider, along with their countryman Jack Shostak, were awarded the Nobel Prize for research in the field of chromosomes.
The price for chemistry was given to Israel Ada Jonathan, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarifying the structure and functions of the ribosomal.
The last laureate had the Nobel prize for economics earned by American Eleanor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went around without a holder this year was physics.
This award was presented today by Charles Kao for research in optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each award-winner received a diploma, Nobel Medal and a financial reward certificate.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (about CZK 25 million).
If there are more marked in each of them, the reward is shared.
Traditionally the most unexpected Nobel Peace Prize was received in the Norwegian Oslo this afternoon by American President Barack Obama.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversy of his appreciation, because he is only at the beginning of his course and is also at the forefront of the country, which is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defending his policy, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary for the fight against peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the demise, Klaus invited him to Hrad.
President Václav Klaus will accept the Minister of Finance Eduardo Janota on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the subject of their Friday meeting.
The budget criticises Klaus as well.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed the meeting.
He wants to deal with Prime Minister Jane Fischer on Monday for his next term in office.
According to the budget law, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should be holding a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, the House agreed on proposals for a left to move money and raised money on the salaries of civil servants, on the operation of social services and on direct payments to farmers.
The government objected to social democracy's proposals by secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The left-hand side of the left-hand side, Klaus and right-hand side led to an acute intra-political dispute, which has led to the raising of the question of the next effect of Fischer's office, which was agreed to in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially eliminates a package of austerity measures that Fischer's government has pushed into the fall to stop the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can and does not have to sign the State Budget Act, said today's debate breakfast with the entrepreneur that the politicians for a longer time neglected the "serious problem", which is the "irsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't think he has a good solution today.
Improvement could only bring a strong government, which could also rely on a wider consensus of political parties, the President.
ODS President Mirek Topolanek stated that the budget is terrifying and the government should consider further existence.
Vice-President Peter Nečas told the Czech Republic that the concept of the office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Greens is obviously no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer in his reaction referred to similar words as "strong statements".
Chief of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted with words that he was horrifying about the deficit of the budget that the former Topolánka government had prepared for this year and that would exceed CZK 200 billion.
Already on Wednesday, ČSSD marked the approval of the state budget for next year for success.
People were also satisfied.
He played Morgan Freeman in the new Clint Eastwood.
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories despite some criticism that the main roles are made by American actors.
The story tells about sport, race, and Nelson Mandel.
The tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and its first black President Nelson Mandel in his life story is the Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by a 19-year-old Mandel to be made in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
A 20-year-old actor who won the prize for his role in Eastwood's drama from the boxing environment, Milion Dollar Baby, has already created, for example, a leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the United States, and even a god in divine Evan, but only a rare person who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work for ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released for freedom in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated and is the name of the poem by William Ernest Henley in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The picture is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African football team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his people remain racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to unite football players who belong on a worldwide scale between outsiders.
The South African team will eventually step into the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandel's story on a canvas.
I had no purpose other than to play this role so that I could bring her closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found that when I was printing your hand, I was taking over your energy, transferring, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon is a film by Françoise Pienaara, captain of the national football team, where white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard world of the rugby.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, he opened it for me, and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in actors' figures compared to their actual designs under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus gained: The undefeated positive reviews and the ambitions of Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation in words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the rotentomatoes.com website, Invictus gained 76 per cent of positive reviews.
Secrets of the Shining Over Norway Solved: The Russians Tested Missile
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed in Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that near the Norwegian borders it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile.
But the start was again unsuccessful and the shot referred to as the "Bulava" type, which was to be originally the blasphemy of the Russian army, became the blackest nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in rocket tests did not have a proper effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, the boulevard didn't take off at all or get hurt in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulave" is already written as "rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This was the 13th attempt in order to start at the beginning normally.
Until the end of the flight, there was a technical damage to the apparatus again.
Apparently, an engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitri Donskij, which sailed beneath the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows a launch from a vessel that is in motion and also submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed broken "Bulava".
In fact, the Nora have not doubted since the first time that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals defend themselves this time and claim that they cannot clearly speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident struck to the third.
In the previous cases, engines broke down right in the first stage.
Although not a single test start was conducted without error, only six out of thirteen of the Ministry of Defence’s top defence failed.
Almost 50 percent success rate therefore fills the generals with optimism and so it still claims that "Bulava" will fly without problems one day and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow in 51 years
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will once again introduce himself in 51 years at a professional hockey game.
The former champion of the world, the Olympic winner and holder of Stanley Cup will help his team CSKA Moscow in need and will appear in the Friday KHL duel against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently President of CSKA.
After Dennis Kuljaš got hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formality, quote AP to the coach of the Moscow club Sergei Nimčinov.
It's not clear yet that the comeback of the famous hockey game will only concern one game.
I think Fetisov is one of the ones who can raise the spirit of other players, said Germany.
Fetisov thus becomes the oldest professional hockey player in the event of an ice return.
In the NHL, he played the whole season for Hartford's legendary assailant Gordie Howe and wrote 15 goals and 26 assistees.
The oldest of the famous Five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic gold, seven World Champions, and triumphed at Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he collected successes in NHL, where he twice raised Stanley Cup in a jersey of Detroit.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has complied with the unions, cancels all overtime.
The management of Hyundai carrier car has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was due to frequent overtime that the trade unions announced a strike on Monday.
That was confirmed by Hyundai Petr Vanek, the speaker of the car.
However, management wants to agree with the trade unions on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, so it was proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday 19 December with two shifts being made, Vanek said.
Server Sedmička.cz wrote that the company of employees working Saturday's shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will get it back on the 28th of November.
According to Vaník, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they have to pay an overtime allowance or they can choose a replacement holiday on 28 December, and then after that they will extend the Christmas holiday by the day, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees will receive paid tickets and lunches.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and thorniest point in terms of the comments and complaints of the experts, as well as of the protestors, who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime per month of December, said Vanek.
Employees of motorists were forced to work another two hours' overtime every day until last week.
Following the signing of the agreement, the committees shall cancel the emergency procedure.
Further negotiations between driving and expert management are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The union chief Peter Kuchar said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign the joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation in the car became worse last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees were spontaneously charged with constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
Management insisted that overtime must be performed by employees in order to meet the requirements for the delivery of cars.
In their Monday standby announcement, the experts also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who had stopped production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime, unions require the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay 5000 crowns for it this year.
Hyundai carrier car now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started last November.
By September, it had produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity being 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also deals with ‘intangible’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already been acquired against the medicines of immunity.
In some cases, this fact prevails over the fact that the compound does not act as strongly as some of the medicines already available.
AIDS cannot yet be cured.
Patients may, however, be greatly prolonged by a combination of drugs that prevent the accumulation of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of the spread of the virus is due to the development of so-called resistant viruses against which medications are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, from the UŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
It has been shown that substances called metallic carbonates affect the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalcarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently from all medicines used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metallocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multilayer cages formed by the atoms of pine, hydrogen and carbon are connected by the atom of metal, in this case by the cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV the protease caused by HIV, it would not result in a mature viral particle infection.
When we stop the HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a work published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this HIV protease series has been tested in the test laboratory and also against its resistant (resistance) variants from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metallic carbonates on the normal variant of enzyme is not as strong as on clinically used medicines, but does not lose its effect on resistant variants that are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and their other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical treatments, such as metal carcinogens, makes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective anti-HIV medicines, says Pavlína Rezáčová, head of the laboratory Structural Biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The argument about the budget, the ODS went to Fischer, he defends himself.
Chief ODS Mirek Topolánek designated the approved budget for next year as "fearful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The ODS statement marked the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He keeps time for analysis.
Vice-President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer working.
The Prime Minister, according to Nepasca, must decide whether he intends to rely in the Chamber on a minority that is fighting a growing deficit, or whether he is in a position to remain in office with the help of a parliamentary left.
The access of the ODS and social democracy to public deficits is diametrically different, Nehčas pointed out.
The House adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber raised money on civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's cost of addressing social democracy proposals was that they secretly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should hold 163 billion crowns with a deficit.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, so complied with the government's wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget commission.
Disappointment and futility
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of the disappointment and sense of vanity, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government is still going to evaluate the situation.
Sometimes it is believed that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of the adoption of the amendments, the situation might seem different.
According to Czech television, Janota was ordered to serve as Prime Minister on Monday.
He indicated that he was considering further separation in the function.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks for another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas do not have what to do with the government nominees of the ČSSD, which has pushed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will give the demise if the House approves other laws to deficits increasing, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment of the Staff Law.
Topolanek: Ministers of ODS nomination did not commit
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers of the nomination of ODS did nothing wrong, emphasized Topolanek in the U.S. text report.
He recalled that at several ministries there were people in the ministerial functions reporting to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
He pointed out that if Fischer decides to abandon the principle of fighting against the height of the deficit of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct to rely on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the Chamber".
Then he says he can't count on the support and tolerance of the civil Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and as soon as it's up to date, so I'm going to do it, he told the press in the Chamber of Defense, Martin Barták, who was nominated to the government by the civil Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS withdrew.
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would obviously vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the Chamber unless the Prime Minister specifically asked for the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, and he then reacted to the question of whether the ODS's absence in the political negotiations on the budget made it difficult for the President of Parliament and the Czech Republic to be absent.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
As long as I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolsheviks of the House and the destruction of everything positive, the Topolane himself reacted.
Under the new ČD order, fewer trains will drive for almost the same fare
Since 13 December, Czech tracks will cancel or limit some less difficult speeds and locations, other connections will strengthen.
From the date of validity of the new timetable, the total volume of transport will be reduced by two percent compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, are not changed.
More opportunities for connecting to the capital will be obtained, for example, by the people of Ostrava, and the routes to this line will add one set of pendolin.
On the contrary, the speedboat will stop going to Bratislava.
Less rapids will also ride on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, significantly limited to direct connections Prague - Letohrad.
The regions plan the largest reduction of transport in the Královéhradeck region, a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to growth.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and several speeds on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route are limited to just a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct link from Milovic to Prague, today they must cross into Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Remote connections to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Main Station.
ČD introduces more connections of SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka/Jeseník will travel at two-hour intervals.
From December 13th to December, passengers will no longer travel to Bratislava by Pendoline.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more
The swifts order and pay the Ministry of Transport, in total to compensate for the so-called demonstrable losses, will give the next year four billion crowns, as well as this year. The locals order the regions, they pay eight billion crowns for them next year, with less than three billion counties contributing to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
There are new ten-year contracts for locals and fasts, and so far the contract has always been for one year.
The auctions praised the system, and therefore apparently did not increase the price of the crushing majority of tickets.
Only one day network tickets ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets will change.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will be increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will be new from the distance, so far it has been uniform and 160 crowns for travel between any regional cities.
Philippine armed forces still hold over 50 people, children released
Today, the armed forces in the south of the Philippines have kidnapped 75 people, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was indicated by the AFP, which initially only informed 65 of the abductions.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
Kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 armed men say they use hostages as a live shield in an escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police were originally persecuted by the kidnappers for the violence that required the settlement of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed was granted a state right.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre associated with elections to the governor's office were 30 journalists.
In order to suspect the involvement of the massacre, the governor of this Yugoslav province was arrested and his father, Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of the influential family of the Ampatuans.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, however, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The next days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech sounds Invictus: undefeated), which captures part of the life story of the former president of the South Africa Republic of Nelson Mandela.
The role of a world-renowned warlord against apartheid was played by Morgan Freeman, whom he said he had chosen Mandela for his creation years ago.
The later male role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby Francoise Pienaara has developed into Matt Damon.
With the film placed in the cinema, the public and critics rise up from their voices.
Nelson Mandela
His entire name, Nelson Rolihlal Mandela, was born on July 18, 1918 in the South African Mosque.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, then in 1993 together with the de Klerek Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for a world championship in football are being peaked in the Republic of South Africa, but at the same time the media are shaking up disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the people by the Black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the announcements of a new film in the JAR are, however, very positive, despite numerous objections to the inclusion of major roles as "problem" by Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new film.
I've been dreaming about that role for years, and I've been getting ready for it.
Many times I also met Nelson Mandela personally to, as they say, draw up his energy in an interview after the film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can make a movie reminding Mandel's personality and message.
It is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every man, added.
In the dressing of the national rugby team.
Image based on British author John Carlin's book proposal, freely translated as enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation is portrayed by the South African human rights advocate during his first presidential term.
So during the film, Morgan Freeman tries to stamp out two racial and long years of mutually defined population groups and, as in 1995, Nelson Mandela, also enters the acting role in South Africa's national rugby jersey jersey at the playground of the world cup that JAR won at that time.
For entering the lawn in the jersey, which is understood almost as sacred in the JAR, he harvested Mandel 14 years ago a great oat mostly of the Belarusian public and gained recognition of the Belarusian population.
The football championship may be able to reconnect people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
If the tense situation in JAR improves, it will only show up.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical, as the recent interview for LN revealed a fan of Rugby Christopher Dawson who fled to Britain.
The championship will start on 11 June 2010.
Tens of millions of crowns are on fire in Loonland.
In the morning, the fire struck the transformer of Čeps in the settlement near the village of Vyškov in Lounsk.
The fire affects six units according to the spokesman for the oral regional firefighter Lukáš Marvan.
Originally, firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later they reevaluated their opinion and the fire extinguished mixed water, foam and special fire substances.
The cause was a technical malfunction, an internal failure of the transformer.
No one was injured, the accident according to Paula Mandát's spokesman does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, and it will be done exactly after the fire.
The destroyed transformer, according to Mandát, will need to be replaced by a new one.
In ten years, the effect of Čeps was nothing like that, the failures of this type are unique, complementary.
The supply of electric current was not interrupted, the operation of households, offices or the fire of a trafosanice was not affected by the company according to ČEZ’s spokesman for northern Bohemia, Soni Holinger Hendrych.
A.s. Čeps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the transmission system, electrical lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 diluents with 67 power transformers from transmission to distribution system and lead routes of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will submit a criminal complaint to three heitmans from the ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will present a criminal complaint today for three socio-democratic straightmen.
And that's on Michal Hasek of South Moravian Region, Radko Martínka of Pardubice Region and Heitman of the Olomouck Region of Martin Tesařík.
Jančura reported it in 20 minutes to Radio.
The action relates to the efforts of the company to operate regional train transport in certain regions.
But all the regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Roads.
All three heitmans are attacking us and talking about our picking raisins, and we brought only what they wanted.
They say we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Roads that were closed last week.
So we don't have to fight back.
It's for an interview with the Student Agency, he told Jančur Radio.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
The hash of filing a criminal notice is considered to be a further continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advert of his company and his own person.
Of course, I'm ready to defend the good name of my country and my country, and I'm going to call other Heitmans to do the same.
Even on this occasion, I believe it will be clear that it is Mr. Jančura, who, in the case of regional rail transport, manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jančura announced last week that he was investing several million crowns in advertising, which will alert the region to a disadvantageous step.
Radio station said that the campaign after Christmas would cease and continue after New Year's Eve.
He specified that the campaign would be directed against corruption as such.
The campaign started after Jančur agreed to operate regional railway links with the Czech Railways and to purchase about 150 billion crowns.
According to Jančura, similar proceedings are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančur has already been threatened by a Member for the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't let it go, we can lose the bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which master he is referring to, his name I will not say, told Radiojural Jančur today.
The vaccination against pneumococcus will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination since January.
It should be the first free and optional for families.
However, voices have already been heard that mandatory vaccinations would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcus peaks.
The Institute of Medicine has already set maximum vaccine prices for health insurance companies.
Experts are also already clearly in the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for children in August
Since January they can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal children born last August 2nd and later.
The condition is that they haven't received a single dose of vaccination yet.
Anyone who started vaccination last year or earlier has to make up for another scratch.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age of the child.
She voluntarily had her children vaccinated against a quarter of the family's pneumococcus last year.
At the same time, the parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose or more.
Four doses are required when the youngest children are vaccinated.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 000 crowns per year on vaccination doses.
But it will save you the treatment children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has provided about 500,000 per year for all general vaccinations.
The cross-vaccination was introduced by a so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain membranes and poisoning of blood.
The pneumococcal infection in our population will die in one year, according to a hospital survey of up to 28 children under the age of 10.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced threatened general vaccinations of children against pneumococcal tyres in 40 countries.
Is vaccination mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
Since January, it is to be played by insurance companies and non-compulsory.
That mandatory vaccination would be better, for example, suggested the head of the civil association Nalas Rudolf Kalovský.
Its association of pneumococcal vaccines has long been promoted.
The experts at the international conference that our association attended were not entirely satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has been achieved.
I think that's the way we need to go now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination against pneumococcus.
At this point, we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršenj.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, says doctors
The President of the Professional Society of Practical Children’s Physicians, Hana Cabrnoch, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it might be considered to reduce the number of reovers "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," said Cabrnoch.
Experts expect to have more than 80 percent of their parents vaccinated against pneumococcus from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcus is also breakthrough in the fact that it is not the State's first general vaccination of children.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, save for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy the ingredients themselves.
However, this involves the concerns of practical paediatric doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original purpose, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors should receive them in a similar way as the state supplies the substances to other vaccinations.
However, some Members feared that it would be possible for insurance companies to "make money out of health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to pay them off.
According to estimates, individual practitioners will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist's 'sole in the museum'
The son of the renowned American creator Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to rob paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
The name Mr Frazetta and the other man used to break into a museum in Poconco Mountains Bagr.
Mr Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, celebrated the creation of the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of the event, an artist was located in Florida, as stated by Associated Press Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer who stated that Mr Frazetta, a younger man could have been motivated by long-standing family disputes.
Before the police, Mr Frazetta issued a younger vow, 52 years old, that he had done so on his father's instructions, "to get to the museum in any way possible and to move the paintings into the freshwater space", as the agency stated.
Mr Frazetta Senior denied any such permission as the Agency said.
Labourers defend the planned increase in taxes
The ministers advocated an increase in taxes and cuts in expenditure announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Torys "lost" the opportunity to show that they mean seriously delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the elections.
Even the chancellor got under fire because of the disability of workers with low and medium incomes.
According to its proposal, this is mainly a 0,5 % increase in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Insensitivity with regard to social insurance
Committees protested that workers with low incomes were punished for a recession they did not blame and warned against "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of approximately 3 trillion pounds per year - which has upset the community of entrepreneurs who stated that it is a tax on employment, while it should be directed towards economic recovery.
This increase, limiting its revenue to more than £20,000 per year, will affect some 10 million workers.
PBR KEY BODIES
Social insurance will increase by another 0,5 % from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen by more than expected 4.75 % this year
New taxation of 50 % of bankers' bonuses
Increase of 1% tax by companies for write-offs in small companies
Reduction of taxes on electric vehicles and wind power plants
Pension measures increase by 2,5 %
According to the State Financial Administration estimates that some £30000 will be reduced by £90 per year and that some £40,000 will be reduced by £190, whereas some £10000 will increase by £110.
The ministers announced that their target of reducing the deficit to half by 2013 meant "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of those with the highest income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"It's a big number. It allows us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely the basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr. Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But the development of a forecast for future economic growth - which will have an impact on the volume of necessary loans and on how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, the economic decline was 4,75 % in this year - far worse than the decline of 3,5 % predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
A Missed Opportunity'
Conservatives who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday, warning against the "crisis of indebtedness" of laborers, marked a planned loan of 789 trillion pounds over the next six years as unbearable.
The ministers failed to submit a credible plan, how it could be compensated, added, "cynics" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They have added nothing significant to be feasible," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections, if we win them."
Roger Booth, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money obtained by increasing taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce deficits, and argue that the plans are "set to sand".
The BBC political commentator Nick Robinson reported on the timing of the announcement - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay the taxes in the next April - that this could lead to the Chancellor's indictment of the election campaign if the money gets difficult back a year later.
But lawyers insist on special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised on September 2010.
Suspect Budget'
Although the ministers did not publish the details of the expenditure after 2011, economists stated that it is clear that the reduction of public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The recognised Institute of Budget Studies has reported that chancellor cifres indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education and defence in the bodonica.
"It is really very painful so far," said his director, Robert Chote.
"The important statements will come after the elections if we win them," said Roger Booth, economic adviser to the Deloitte account manager.
"That was the report on the suspect's preliminary budget, and the markets are implementing it."
FBI's conducting an investigation into the American prisoners in Pakistan.
The FBI is conducting an investigation at a prison in Pakistan in five Americans who are suspected of being connected to extremists.
Men were imprisoned for attacking a house in Sargoda in the province of eastern Panjab, as reported by the BBC of the American Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was an investigation into whether it was the same men who had been declared missing in the last month in their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors, and the others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and under what circumstances they stayed there," spoke Ian Kelly.
F.B.I. Katherine Schweit reported that the agency had been informed of the arrest and had been in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they really are missing students," she said.
Pakistani embassy in Washgington stated that men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncles of one of them.
It stated that the house had always been the center of interest of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, said Reuters, but stated that the United States must "co-operate much more with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism, which covers recruitment and training of persons".
The disappearance of these five students from their home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Denial of amnesty for Iranian tyranny.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years as the Amnesty International expedition reports.
The report describes in detail "the methods of torture" in the regime before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials described this criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran and dozens were killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Tens of them were imprisoned, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, now located in London, stated that earlier in the protests of High Leader Ayjatolah Ali Chomejni, he declared the illegality of certain forms of torture and prohibited their implementation in Karizak’s correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticisms of the statutory power have been tolerated, as stated by our writer.
Untrue confessions'
Amnesty International quoted a 26-year-old student's report from Abraham Methari's computer technology, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protesting against the results of the elections.
"I was often face-to-face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... and threatened to execute me and humiliate me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests and tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian senior officials denied rape charges, but admitted torture occurred.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container with another 75 persons for more than eight weeks in a Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had set up committees for the investigation of civil unrest and government reactions, but indicated that the mandate and powers of the institutions had been unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees had been published.
The group stated that at least 90 persons had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform the Bristol monument into a ski slope for the race.
The ski slope for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the ski slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump bridge 100 metres ago a long ski slope.
A fourth-year medical student, John Hickman, said that it was a beautiful view from the top of the ski slope, but that it was really challenging.
It was a beautiful view of the city's flashing lights downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them were real talents," he added.
Prices were awarded for the best pieces - or manoeuvres on the ski slope.
After the Thursday evening race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us.
Can he be Muslim French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of minerals and general reports of alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and contemplated whether the Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrated - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
After reading this book, some readers became admirers of the author's last work, "Why French people don't like hats" (2006), this elegant and debated study on issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the heart.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutions, which now care for 5 ± 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "the Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern him the most.
Should Muslims enter the marriage union in a mosque or a town hall (or both places)?
Should young Muslims be taught about gay development and rights?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslims have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if they want to get a mortgage?
These seem to be the world’s contentious issues, which are discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known persons, not excluding Tarik Ramadan, Araba, Muslim researcher and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion on how to simultaneously be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are untrustworthy of the real idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen conducted an interview are inclined to the house that this is an anti-Selafi—Purist Sunni Islam's supporters associated with Saudi Arabia—this group is small but is affecting European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
The question is how far French politics (and the intellectual elite, which so squandered the lay public) are truly devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims have probably less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to compromise historically with secular republics.
More than the development of pragmatism has found "absorbing the screws of values".
After reading this book, someone might be inclined to say, "Yes, but not now."
The comfortst prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
The limiter ice melts alarmingly at an alarming rate, which affects the animals and their survival elsewhere.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on the new natural resources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they are awakened.
In the book "On the Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icon of the North, a polar bear.
The long tradition of polar explorers who tried to take hold of the white bear is well - known for their complicated history and practices.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a courageous 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with a round of musketeers is a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming for the bodies of their dead mothers were caught and sent to the zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared in one circus tent.
Even today the fences in the zoo have typically millions of times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.
After clicking here you will find more!
Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often comes back to threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America, and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indians are hunted on skis and all are armed with powerful assault rifles that shoot off their prey.
Ironically, it happens in the waters north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the biggest.
In his new book "By the Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and uncomfortable responsibility for science for the Arctic and a seductive summer view of how the future can change it.
Not everything scientists have answers.
Not even meteorologists and oceanographers have an adequate response to the speed of change.
It's for lack of testing.
Fridtjof Nansen’s research tours at the end of the 19th and early 20th century for the first time suggested how ice flows.
Cold-war submarines then mapped moving over when they submerged them.
Satellite research and a wide range of probes in floating glaciers are a useful supplement, but many are still being conducted thanks to the unwarranted individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking into the extremely fragile world of the flounder system inside the Arctic ice, created by the liquefying of saltwater, which is smothered when it freezes.
But from the height of that bear to the microscopic wonders, enter all this is doomed to decay when summer ice moves, which will sometimes occur between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... we can be us'
6,000 Marines put their prisoners on the graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angelo Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours on a bus to put a simple wreath on a soldier's grave, who he never met.
For him and the other members of the Marine Corps who made their way from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, that was the day on which they gave up respect for men and women who used to wear the same shoes.
In a few months, when we get on board, we can be us, Robinson told us about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to put the wreaths on the cemetery veterans in several departments during the drinking act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and a few others decided to decorate several hundred graves during a drinking act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. NMorill and his wife, Karen, take this journey every year and stop in various cities along the road to worship the memory of members of the army and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters do not seek profit, the wreaths across America, which they also lay in other states.
In this year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 prisoners at Arlington Cemetery, on the Pentagon, on the graves of the National Cemetery Fayetteville in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York City, and at the memorial site of flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart has devoted more than $150,000 to buying and transporting wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she was taking a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband wasn't buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way to recover what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Encased in warm cloth coats, volunteers walked through graveyards along nearby lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed for the older graves of World War I and II and Vietnam, because these are not visited as often as the newer graves.
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together when they transported the young pine trees to the founding tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red arch of bees upper part.
Near § In section 60, where most of the veterans of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, the silence remained.
The United Service Organizations devoted 1,000 wreaths to decorating the department, but the cloudy mood of the ongoing wars filled this area.
Some were sincerely crying, others were praying, and families and friends were holding each other in cold air.
Some read out loud names, carved into stones, while others leaned to look at small black and white names, pressed into wet mud where gravestones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who was tearing tears out of their eyes before their son's grave.
She went eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the post of last resting sergeant of David Shane Spicer's artillery, who fell in a fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, the rules.
"Even when I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
US government supplier trapped by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has imprisoned an American government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, according to officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the American interest section in Havana, sought access to the detainee who was imprisoned on 5 December.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is termed "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical stats, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
In Cuba there is a young blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to take over the prices, but the permit was denied.
The detention of an American supplier may be a result of a growing tension between the Communist Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a "restraint tactic" in improving relations with the island.
The first reported the New York Times incarcerated on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the united states will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average wage of a state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government gave ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used to send text messages because the 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
The use of the internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to apply, must declare their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Arresting an American in Cuba is a rare thing.
Most of the U.S. citizens in the prison in Cuba are behind bars for stress cases, such as drug smuggling, Gloria Berbenová, U.S. Department of Press for American Interests in Havana, said.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
Imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities as would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the US Human Rights Group Programme, who recently published an adverse report on the freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, the same as Cuba," as an indication of the installation of Raul Castro as a leader of the country and compensation for the Croatian older brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the defendants were often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are heading for a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are opening a conspiracy concerning the sending of men to Afghanistan.
The Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday the alleged leader of a conspiracy concerning the sending of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops there, and indicated that they were hoping that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruits who are tracking the Internet and searching for radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they were looking for the grey rebel personality known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men published a comment approving terrorist attacks has a YouTube video page.
Saifillah took the leadership of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan in the zone of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its camps for training terrorists.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaida commanders and that men were not part of the CIA attempted infiltration into the terrorist network.
As a result, they were dropped out after several days in the eastern Sarghody district, far from the threatening mountains in the northwest, which have become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
That was why they were dropped out, said an official who spoke about maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain consent to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the execution of Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is more important, to determine who is credible.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the American Intelligence Service has assigned the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The organization’s recruits function as watchmen, cutting off those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be interrogators.
American fake recruits were subjected to a special examination by al-Qaeda, according to analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential access to US targets and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become more cautious in recent years in allowing whom to join them because US intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to enter these groups, there is no better way than to proceed according to their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the website.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action.
Tens of thousands of protestors marched through the streets this Saturday and demanded a stronger action on climate than negotiators in the city's Bella Congress Centre.
The protestors quoted the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but the police overstated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists placed a few small charges near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day that a small event occurred in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists went through the city and carried banners with the English inscriptions "Toto is not planet B" (i.e. second-class) and one in Spanish that said "Country calls 'Enough'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensenová, who said that she had travelled to her mother's hometown in Peru and provided me with information on the dissatisfaction of the country on which climate change is taking part.
That is part of the reason why we have decided to join this great march -- to pass through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it is necessary to do so, it cannot be avoided.
Police prevented protestors from approaching the centre of Bell and indicated that she had arrested 19 people, first of all because they either wore masks or had pocket knives on them.
These activities are, according to Danish law, prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists masked as athletes and placed several charges in black clothes near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
Agitated at the buildings, stated, started with lights, but then followed "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not reach the awareness of key officials, such as Su Wei, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether, however, the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is really something that I do not realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the history is vast, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of everyone.
You can see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a breach of the conduct or freedom of others.
Test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certificate on knowledge of mathematics was a welcome feature of good news on public education in Columbia County.
Although the district is far behind the country's high performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth grade pupils in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest issues of the National Testing Centre for the Progress of Teaching are the persistent differences in knowledge gained between African Americans and white students, both local and national.
The average score of the fourth-grade white pupils in Columbia has increased from 267 to 270 points (from possible 500) over the past two years, but their African-American peers have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress in African Americans in the eighth grade remains substantially balanced, with a deviation of statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The mean result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between the white and black pupils of the fourth grade in 2003, when the first NAEP was carried out in the district, was 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from both groups has improved during this period, the difference has barely reached 58.
Some law enforcement officials in the district stated last week that the results celebrated by the mystery of Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were widely stimulated in white students where the results had already been high.
This would indicate that we have increased the support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of employment in the district.
I do not jump up and down because of the spread of two or three points, said a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing the style of Mrs Rhee's administration, Mrs Brown stated that the report on the results of the test means high school in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the hammers, and I respect that.
But what is horrifying is that we did not devote almost no time and energy to our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said that the effort of the district is to continue to find better ways, focused on the needs of students with low results.
In this fall, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new basics, Wilson's reading system, focused on students of higher grades of elementary schools and high school students who have not been able to manage the basics of reading before in their peer careers significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics and the basic teaching of mathematics into the sixth grade, highlighting the games and experiences of real life that have reached the district for former director Clifford Janeyi, can be added to the row progress of the NAEP, about which the report was reported last week.
And I just think that we should continue to work and do the best possible interventions for those students who remain below class levels, said Mrs. Rhee.
Others stated that the results of the NAEP clarified whether Ms Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain reputable dilemma for Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California in Berkeley where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The Convention's remedial procedure is to focus the funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the district of Colombia.
Thus, the focus can bring political sounds that are directed against an important agenda.
However, the cost includes other city directors who are trying to keep the medium range between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must use our schools to ensure that all families, regardless of where they live, can count on their children to be given excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now head of schools in Newark, stated in an interview this week that the main element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, in order to realize the eligibility of schools.
You need to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who made a deal with his school year association last year in 185 days, which he considered "a symptom" to look for a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The tour bus drove into the Gettysburg Railway with a loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, stepped up and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracillina's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela, herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the land of the track.
Now she and other pupils of the eighth grade in the group were studying Gettysburg, where the school made $38690 a year, their position was rather than the frightening visitors excited by potential students.
Yes! That's it! called Graciel, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? rules thoughtfully when they told them the low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania Railway was one of the seven who visited their three-day tour and were now fully interested in the future report: The question is not whether you will enter the track.
The question is where.
However, this is a nasal problem regarding the high number of children born to Spanish immigrants who are excluded from high school or pregnant as minors in the United States, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive further education and so enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "spiritual generation" of Spanish students from the track - remarkable results reported that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, had reached the United States without completing their high school.
Their success story is important, according to researchers, because it highlights their point of departure for the generation that played a marginal role in the country's labour force field.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they have had a natural affection for school and a natural persuasion and effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school curricula also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to take the college course - especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we take into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them get involved in the system, any simple intervention at each point will not solve it, says Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these children with a preschool network in all ways they can clean up high school.
The federal program that financed Graciela’s tour on the tracks is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (adapted), it provides more than $300 million per year for local school systems for the launching of secondary training programs that start for students from groups with small incomes in high schools and continue until these students graduate from high school.
Since 1999, the programme has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom have entered colleges, according to data from the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to bring significant oil companies into reconstruction of its inanimate infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of the Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been plagued by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have gone with capital participation in exactly two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies paid for the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on a field that was auctioned in June.
The direct participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here first on the path of Asia and Europe, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
That'll be long before anything else is in Iraq for sale.
Concerns about security, highlighted by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. army, are likely to discourage American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has a proven third largest raw materials reserve, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies were in failure, especially Chinese and other governments controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more risk-sensitive because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that had concluded agreements with the Ministry.
The leading American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintained close contact with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, went empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The State of China National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers on more contracts than all other companies and went with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economy, as well as technological power, said the spokesman for the oil industry, Assam Jihad.
We believe that Chinese society will be comparable to competition and honour its obligations towards Iraq.
Companies selected for submission of tenders, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
In the impact of the American rocket at the Pakistan/Afghan border this week, the top al-Qaeda operation planner was apparently killed, as announced by U.S. anti-terrorist officials on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second fatal attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets crashed on their vehicle near Miran Sáh in the province of Sevver Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have noted that missiles have been fired from an unmanned aircraft of a type operated by the CIA in a zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were indicated on a white car heading towards the Afghanistan border when hit, the official, along with the Pakistani C.I.A., telephoned from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local armed forces had jumped to a point and quickly entertained what was left of "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. anti-terrorist officials quoted an unspecified witness who said that Somalia was posthumous.
Somalia was described as a highly built al-Qaeda military operation planner who managed terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in a global recovery, said a senior official who did not wish to be appointed, who referred to the sensitive nature of the American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Qaeda's top leadership and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another American official said that Somalia was fast progressing in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but that he had not been humiliated in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban who should have been killed since September when Namudin Jalololov was killed in a similar attack, the leader of the militant faction in the zone of indigenous tribes and three other top operative leaders.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA by unmanned aircraft has decreased from an average of six operations per month to two, according to the Long War logbook, a website managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may have a reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people suspected of being informants, said the site.
The top United Nations delegation in Kabul resigned.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would like to withdraw from his office in March and end a turbulent period of office, which was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the election of the President in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide is leaving because Obama's administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate stated that he was in favour of an increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable to reduce the state of affairs, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO States to withdraw their powers.
We need to speed up the building of the Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil servants helping with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied to the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he did not resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look after a follower, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun to seek compensation.
Officials stated that they were deciding between Staffan di Mistura, who had Swedish-Italian origin and had previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, Frenchman who had previously conducted the UN peace operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election by masking the presence of massive electoral machinery.
Eide denied this claim, but stated that Galgraith's charge -- which was released -- "has definitely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide indicated that he had proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens to coordinate the easing of efforts to lead the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also ruled with the UN to enable his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to an Afghan mission, so he said he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money was properly used.
Eide expressed his disappointment at restricting his efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the UN’s heavy-duty hiring regulations undermine its ability to use their abilities.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to receive only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world power would soon impose "other significant sanctions" on Iran because of the lack of involvement in the talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a week's journey to areas where war in Afghanistan and Iraq is taking place, provided the prospect of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, said in response to a soldier's question about likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is inconceivable in the war.
Obama's administration decides on a package of sanctions that could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and restraints" would require "to get the Iranian government to really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its inhabitants will be extremely suffering" sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion issued by the Spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved the European leader in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not fully comply with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wishes to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks about restricting his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of his supply of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration was based on such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems that Iran has deviated from the provisional agreements - partly because of this, the expert points out, because the Iraqi leadership is divided in terms of whether to engage in the United States.
To be honest, when it comes to Iranian stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals which he actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think this has led to an international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, on a journey that is not on the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to search for other elections, including monitoring, which the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degradable sanctions".
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned on Thursday what it called "unreasonable and unsubstantiated allegations" against some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue its discussions with the United States and five other world powers" in order to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before leaving for Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
There remains a high tension between Kurdy and the Iraqi majority, particularly due to borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent the retention of US plans to limit the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to alleviate Kurdish concern over continuing depression. The official U.S. places quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzaanji, president of the Kurdish regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In ageing China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on which they read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to use more children" and "One child in addition means an extra grave".
Then they learned that when the official government positions in Shanghai were alarmed by the low birth rate and the ageing population in their town, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn't leave anything for the others, says Wang, 31, a human resource administrator who has an eight-month-old son.
For more than 30 years, China's policy of having only one child has been introduced and thus created two generations of only notoriously chubby and spoiled children, effectively nicknamed "little emperors", threatens the country's population crisis.
The average birth rate dropped to 1.8 children per pair compared to six, before the political mix came into force, according to the UN.
The distribution of the population, where the number of people aged 60 and over, is projected to increase from 16.7 percent in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in rich coastal cities with a population of higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 years of age and older made up almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered inhabitants, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai City Commission for the Population and Planning of the Family, said that many couples must have children "to help reduce the proportion of ageing populations and reduce the number of labour in the future".
He says it's about being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden.
Gradual calming
As was introduced into the Constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably the most controversial mandate put in place under the rule of the Communist Party to date.
The doubles that violated politics faced huge fines -- three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials promoted a policy that helped the country prevent the critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned in promoting politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to subject themselves to abortion during the second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist selection losses, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually milder in their opinion on the policy of one child.
In 2004, they generally authorized exceptions - including city dwellers, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were only -- and in 2007 they reduced the dictates of their hard lines.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Institute of Population Research, said that central government officials had previously debated more radical changes than allowing couples to have two children if one partner was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first city in China to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight there were posters, urging parents to have only one child, replaced with copies of the regulation, detailing how it would be lawful to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
City administration sent family planning officers and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and bring flyers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, the family planning officials said.
Thrill response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai noticed an increase in interest in couples who wanted to have a second child after the campaign started, most urban districts reported no change.
The town district of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, kept registering four to five cases a month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai stated that despite the campaign, the number of born in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu district, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best kid, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juan, 26 years old, said that she would like to have two children and were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a dedicated capture network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West are misjudged by the politics of one child as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant in connection with the first child.
Yes, we were bitten by a chance to have more than one child.
But the problem isn't just politics.
It's about money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resource manager, says that they only want one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of the attention of our families and everyone was looking after us.
We weren't used to provide care, and we didn't really want to take care of each other.
Chen Zijian, a 42 - year - old flying translation society, expressed this much less.
For middle-class two-year-old parents who had reduced birth rates, he said being successful means being selfish.
Today's 20 and 30 years of growing up view parents as the first days of China's capitalism experiment, and they don't want to live for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on the time of parents, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions about the propstor -- "You have to reset your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a resume ready at a time when a child is nine months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to be satisfied with one child, says Che, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored conference on climate -- characterized by far-reaching unpunished attitudes and peer-response -- again on Friday focused on the release of a document that proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations carrying most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which can provide an exit to the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as highlights the way forward.
But there was significant progress in the negotiations, which took place in due course with more than 100 world leaders who will come to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the United Nations ad hoc working group, this text gives an inconspicuous indication of how much money the rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that their carbon output can be reduced and what should be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that politicians will still be able to tolerate.
It's a process of a high dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the Supreme Representative of the Washington Club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutayar, who proposed a six-page document, delineated 180 pages of text from negotiations to focus on what top officials on climate issues at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as "a great painting".
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations together could limit their emissions to 25 to 45 per cent by year, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union has swiftly negotiated on Friday promises that it will provide 3.6 trillion dollars over the next three years to help poorer countries accept adaptation to climate change -- from flood management and drought to forest management.
On Friday, however, he listed the same type of verbal fireworks that prevailed during last week’s talks.
The US Special Envoy for Climate Questions, Todd Stern, rejected a speech requiring binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared to the voluntaryness of the major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move signaled that Obama's administration set up a tougher line against China's Bebe Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States does not enter into a treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and the execution of actions, Stern said, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei informed the US chief negotiator about the climate issues that either lack of "selsen mind" or "immortal irresponsibility" had earlier led to a one-week announcement that the United States would not have helped China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the world's major powers at stake, they broke out the tahanes both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is taking place mostly on the preservation of individual economies, rather than on the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States in fulfilling their respective obligations, while the poorer nations point out that the two tens of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives for carrying out more powerful actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate to Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting for who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers from taking responsibility in their actions.
It is a clear game that new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for the international protection of nature.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable to climate change suggested that they would like to continue to enforce legally binding agreements in Copenhagen, but most of the main players said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page proposal for an agreement last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that the promotion of small island nations "brought political pressure on the whole polyurtic process" partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The meeting gave rise to a new urgency once the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government came into contact with the agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Minister of Environmental Protection Jairam Ramés and Chinese Deputy Minister stepped out of the aircraft and conducted halls at the Bella centre for closed meeting doors and new conferences so they could set out the demands to be assessed next week.
The total size of the meetings - when 13,000 people moved from and to the congress centre every day, to guitars playing activists staged at night ironing the countries they thought had been sent, and there were handing out proposals from hand to hand on paper rather than by e-mail -- controlled by the challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the middle of 60 heads of state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister for Global Policy for International Conservation of Nature.
Hard weights are coming.
British first train with 140 miles an hour to redefine this Monday feeling
At 5:13 p.m. on Monday morning, the Hvid cut through the darkness on the sign of the departure of the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches 140 miles per hour from Ashford, Kent, to St. Pancras, London, and reaches a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed personal set outside of lLndýn.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with the international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great agglomeration of Midland, north and Scotland to London.
Restricted standing waters should shorten traffic times in passenger transport and on commercial routes and the transition from aircraft and cars to the railway could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties have been allowed to gain this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network have now accelerated the building of British high-speed lines.
The High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a feasibility study to the government, submitted its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times stated.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of another planned high-speed network stage.
A new route of London’s link with West Midland was proposed within five metres in urban areas and districts, where it could be problematic to access the environment.
In the open landscape it was scheduled to take up to 25 m of the final route.
HS2 also foresees three choices for an extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option is to confify the shape of letter Y when one high-speed track should lead to West Midland.
The track should be split near Birmingham with one branch passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading northward to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that there has been the most effective choice," said the railway authority.
As soon as it's done, the times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
Proposals should allow trains to travel at a speed of 2,250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to take trains of 400 m length that would be able to transport 1,100 persons.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham track.
This means that the London Terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing stations would expand to take over the high-speed network.
Railway experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he intends or does not intend to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that no final decision will take place before general elections.
Even if he's moving the wheels, the network should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but already existing tracks north of Birmingham and keep the time between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered a decisive contact point to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, an orientation point for the rail revolution.
Taxes paid a mortgage of £75,000 on Tory's orange
Alan Duncan, holder of the Tory's front seat bench in the Chamber, paid taxpayers thousands of pounds of costs last year for the orangery he built in his house in the constituency.
The spokesman for the prison, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the Members were living "out of allocations", raised his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-covered extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, totalling hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The local authorities approved the claims in due time and so was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out the control of the expenditure members. Last night Mr Duncan said his requirements "It was easier or cleaner to be cleaner".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two-story houses at all in his province of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the financial office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to his house, which is in plans called "arrangements".
Neighbors describe it as "a glass of entertainment and hospitality".
Mr Duncan was not requested to provide some explanation for the increased loan during the last check by the Committee on General Standards and Privileges in the latest comparison of the mortgage.
The committee told him last month that he broke the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the umbilical security to a mortgage of £271406 from his property in London to a house in his election district, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Members.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed approximately 1,400 pounds a month in favour of the mortgage until March last year.
In April his claims rose to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest on the RBS mortgage of Mr Duncan could not have changed at this time, indicating that all this was intended to finance a loan of £75,000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage payment dropped from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, while it remained.
The latest document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 a month in May.
Mr Duncan left his job as Shadow Leader of the House in September after a secret lawyer filmed him and said that the Members must survive "on assignment" after the expenditure scandal.
"In principle it is born, you have to live on an allocation and treat you like s**t."
He said, "I lost money for my garden and my claim and a small fraction for what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn stake, but I won't do it."
The MP, a millionaire from his former oil trade career, was first invited to explain his edition in May when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before the approval of the Financial Authority, that it "could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug the cave in the shape of a pound in Mr Duncan's lawn for a protest after it was discovered that he claimed £4,000 for three years.
When asked about an increase in the mortgage last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was due to an increase in capital, which was approved by both the financial office and then Legg."
He added: "this is not a controversial issue of hiding and calling or breaking rules or anything else.
It's an absolute straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's all.
This would not be easier or cleaner in many other ways."
Come and take a close look at the cabin on the Brooklyn coast with the adventurous calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new sense of life in the winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages ducious use with creativity called 24 owners to decorate their huts for every day in December, and to use Christmas collets as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1st, when it allowed visitors to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop’s bread and welded wine provided free of charge.
The selected colleges included the Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the cottage represented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant on TV marketing from Hove, is a priest without scholarship in the Chichester diocese and Head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important to people in post - Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a moving way.
"The idea of an adventurous calendar in the cottages emerged just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and pulsating place and we have tried and presented it spiritually."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went out on Saturday to the streets requiring a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where hundreds of people were arrested by police on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources and one hundred thousand by organizers, demonstrated in cool weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement on Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilisation, with clear evidence of contemporary manifestations, would contribute to the fact that "political tax" of potential failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to the journalist AFP, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the introduction of the parade, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break up the expositions with nail cubes and hammers.
Real police immediately hit hard.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were particularly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical separate groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and in a seat "keepin the streets still on Saturday night" despite extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade calmly went to Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate.
For the speakers, a podium was built before which a spiritual meeting was held during candlelight with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most protestors arrived by bus and train from large European cities and, besides Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue cloaks, created the first assembly in Copenhagen in the morning, at the challenge of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create a "blue wave" for a "just climate".
Today we go to the streets to demand compensation for ecological debt for the benefit of the south, explained Lidy Nacpilová, a Filipino warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't say anymore: it's time for that, the Beninian singer Angelique Kidjo declared.
In Africa rivers and streams are drying up, today we can walk in them, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the struggle for another world has drawn closer to environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world said that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands particularly sensitive to the warming of the climate.
In Australia, about 50,000 people walked into the streets by organizers.
There were several hundred people in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes and with dresses evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters went to the streets requiring strong measures against climate change.
In France, the protests organized by the movement "350" took part in hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (jij), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people met in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has chosen its president, Georgia condemns it as a "frakka"
On Saturday, Abkhazia elected its president, about a year after Moscow considered this pro-Russian separatist territory independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declared this step a "frahka".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections following the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008 on the control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
Election rooms closed in 17 hours GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, participation was 58% a few hours before the elections were closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of combining Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These choices are big.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili 's regret is that Abkhazia has fallen completely into Russian domination," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgalage.
In addition to Russia, only 216.000 inhabitants of Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by the Russian forces.
After the separation from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people were killed, Abkhazia is trying to demonstrate through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said letter AFP Kvarčija Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagaps.
She was one of those who came to vote in an election room at the school in the capital Sukhumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the shore of the Black Sea, which can be proud of beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country, 216,000 residents have placed huge billboards with Bagapš next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the fine conduct of the elections awaited a warm welcome by the district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We, Abkhaz, are grateful" said during a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, its decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament and took a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimb and two merchants, Zaus Ardinbo and Beslan Boutba, criticised contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract that allows Russia to control the Abkhaz rail network for 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
A 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this result, the decisive match must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went out on Saturday to the streets requiring a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources and one hundred thousand by organizers, manifested in the cool weather in the Danish capital, which is hosting until 18 December 193 delegations, on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade calmly went to Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate.
For the speakers, a podium was built before which a spiritual meeting was held during candlelight with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to the journalist AFP, there were incidents shortly after the departure of the parade, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed wholes in black and armed bricks and hammers, began to break the window.
The orderly police immediately encircled them and hit them without waiting, several of the manifestants knocked them down.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were particularly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical separate groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Later in the afternoon, one officer on the jaw was wounded by a nail cube and four cars were lit near a squat nearby incident, which they had as a result according to police sources of detention of about 20 people.
We're focusing on extremist groups, warned Henrik Jakobsen P.D., while the helicopters flew into the air again.
Most of the protestors who took the bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European origins.
But there were also many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue cloaks, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the challenge of Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create a "blue wave" for a "just climate".

French MEP José Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world said that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam has called several known personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands particularly sensitive to the warming of the climate.
In Australia, about 50,000 people walked into the streets by organizers.
In Manila several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and with dresses evoking the importance of solar energy, were shown before the council of the capital city of Filipín.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with a demand for strong measures against climate change.
In France, the protests organized by the movement "350" took part in hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (jij), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

The subjects of the geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of general gymnastics, Chatel said.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during an interview with JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "enhanced" as part of the reform of general gymnastics, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of the Gymnasium.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week, and for all will also be the same programme from general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "there is a need to end hypocrisy" because according to him S specialization is no longer focused on exotic sciences, but "in essence, there are the best students in it".
The EC and L specializations cannot be with what kind of sub-specializations, continues and emphasises: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would complain that in the last year of professional high school education they do not learn geography and history".
A survey by the Agency of Ifop, which published the Humanities Journal on Saturday, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) did not agree with the government project to abolish compulsory history and agriculture education in the senior year with specialization S, so many intellectuals and teachers also criticised this cancellation, both on the left and on the right.
On the contrary, the minister added that "not to be taken into account" to abolish philosophy in the specialization program with the senior year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform in teacher education, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilisation against this project, which they considered to be sacrificing the pedagogical education of future Gymnasium professors.
As part of Master’s Study 2 (M2), the Minister explained at the beginning of the year the reception examination focused on their field and at the end of the year the next examination to verify their ability to teach.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of Master's degree and will perform in the first year in front of the pupils as a professor.
If you count all the internships that will be offered to you before the reception procedure, you will get more experience with the pupils, almost 300 hours, has continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map until 2012.
At the elite École University, experts have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is a challenge announced by Jean Jouzel, multi-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Development (GIEC) at the initiative of the University of Ecole norm supérieure on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the conference "Ernest", which is a one-day seminar composed of fifteen minutes of experts' contributions to be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and, on the basis of what they would like to learn more, explained at the occasion of the 22-year-old conference Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who got a name according to the fish from the local lake, which the students named.
Some 20 experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and specified that the choice is based on their charisma.
About warming the climate "We can talk about hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of 50 listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that the listeners would learn that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific basis".
Videos filmed at these lectures will be placed on the school web since 15 December.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Payment delays: angry prison guards, planned measures
The prison guards' committees announced on Friday 'general mobilisation', as they require that they be paid premiums and overtime at Christmas, whose remuneration has been postponed to January for financial reasons.
Prison FO (2. guards' departments) asked employees who would not have a service to participate in demonstrations held on Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities and to "block them" and thus alert them to "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3st trade unions in this sector) has called for "calling for meetings in individual prisons and initiating substantial mobilisation" with the fact that it is "obtrusive and unacceptable" so that "times and overtime for work at night, Sundays and holidays" held in October are not covered in December.
First Boards of Supervisors, Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for overall mobilisation (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and frustration".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime increased considerably in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but they ensure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellorship stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mariová had sent a message to the prison supervisors to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts the prison staff make to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes to the minister in his report.
I ordered the administrative directorate of the prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that, in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari's situation, which had been miscalculated by the number of overtime, had never been repeated.
Therefore, the minimum wage will be low, with the exception of managers who receive the famous premiums for performing their functions and achieving their objectives, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those "there will always be a place in the budget".
It's just a scandal, an infuriated inter-regional FO Union in Marseille, and announced her decision to boycott the appeal of "all meetings and appeals".
Employees will not work on Sundays or holidays, unless they are paid extra fees for these days of October in December, as well as overtime, also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and more tasks without giving us more staff, it is sad to allow those lowest employees to pay for this, reports the CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better at it than others.
However, in any case, the funds of the spring were few, according to Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives "better gifts" at Christmas than the ones he gets.
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, told the "goddess" screen by Oprah Winfrey that as far as gifts are concerned, has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke on the special issue of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday night at the ABC station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, a little four-legged companion of the family gets his cut.
Jesus likes Boe too, said Michelle Obama with the fact that the dog also gets a "absolutely" gift as a result of the excerpts from the show's preliminary broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also turned against her husband's claim on the quality of gifts, which he gets: "No, I certainly didn't, I gave you a great gift last year," teased the president.
Well, that's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after he was humorous, he showed a finger on the pearl necklace of the first ladies, "And who gave you this?"
In this one-day very relaxed show with the famous moderator, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obama wives also talked about their favorite gifts, which they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a round with a ten-degree gearbox, but also a basketball that was dedicated to him by his Kenyan father at Christmas, whom he only met very rarely.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and how he gave me that basketball, the president told me.
Long after, I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady remembered the dollhouse again.
I didn't know how to organize it all in the house, so I straightened all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, and I remembered Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday's back in surgery, RTL says he's in an artificial sleep.
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to "injury" arising from a larger operation he performed in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while the RTL station stated that the singer is in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated in the middle of the night on Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "injury resulting from the operation" of an incision plot that he had performed in Paris on November 26th, reported in Paris his printing department, requiring "adjustment surgery".
However, the press department tried to calm the public and indicated that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical communication would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial sleep to prevent "pain and complications".
48 hours after the patient opens his eyes, we'll be a little more confident, he's adding RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on this information at the request of the AFP.
RTL also states that according to "some sources", no wire was installed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on the Parc Monceau International Clinic for the incision plate.
The surgery, scheduled several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajux, a doctor well known in artistic circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to express himself to RTL information.
After this operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for infections that occurred after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, told the RTL radio Thursday that his boyfriend was just going through a "bad time," but he added that the rocker "don't worry" because it's a big "warr".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid things because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation was no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer producer Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well with antibiotics" and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laeticia, a singer’s wife, and that he did not notice any particular concerns.
The singer's health problems have only occurred since July, when he was hospitalized nine days after the fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small small intestine tumor" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", presented as his bachelor party.
But since then, every medical problem he has had has been followed and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving to the stage.
In mid-November, his team had to dement a report on a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/Small Pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a large swimming pool, won the 2009 European Championship on Thursday in a small swimming pool in Istanbul, which he particularly likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, on which the suits are last allowed, only three world records fell, although much more were expected.
One of them beat Hungarian racers Evelyn Verrastová to the 200 m position race and two other men's staff of Russia to the 4x50 m position race.
A great sadness for Bousquet, who made a lock on the world record at 50 m free, already holding a large swimming pool (20,94).
In one of two royal swimming disciplines, 50m free way, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, on which the premiere started ten swimmers instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Chorvata Dje Draganja (20,70) and Rusa Sergei Fesikova (20,84), but he failed to overcome the world record (20.30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record is within my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from 1 January.
From February 2008 to the 238 world record books and their era ended in Istanbul, which was the first to host the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination this time did not help the Germans Paul Biedermann, a double master of the world in a large swimming pool in the summer of Rome, which had a world record to reach their hands.
The young swimmer failed to overcome a record that holds 400 metres free mode (3:32.77), but still won the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Madsem Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything into the race.
I knew I wouldn't get the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent for the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: A board of the Romani sarcophagus belonging to Zolov was auctioned for USD 1.5 million
The board of the Romani sarcophagus, which belonged to no one other than the French writer Emil Zolo, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than estimated, said Sotheby's art dealer.
The price of this two meters long and 63 cm high front plates, coming from the third century of our year, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysovian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satirs and bakchants is a rare piece, similar pieces are very few in the world, perhaps four or five," said the AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The business was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still under way, but it is an object that was awarded the most, reported to the AFP agency spokesman Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The fact that Emile Zola took this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgi family and then gradually appeared at the French actress Cecile Sorela, who decorated with it a bathtub at her private hotel in Paris and at Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and shortly before joining the Council President, Marshal Petain.
It's been blocked for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered during a search for the museum database in Louvre that this board was part of the "remains of Emil Zoly" opened from 1903, the year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Interrogated attempt on President Zelaya's departure from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico concluded on Thursday that the conditions for the transfer of President Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a safe exit guarantee were not met.
After a phone call I had at night with President Zelaya, all for the time being suggests that there is no way to make this transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government plane that flew into Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya flew back, said the source of the Directorate General for Migration.
The Government of Puchis wanted to force President Zelaya to "demise" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only to provide him with the possibility of safe departure.
But the President rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of state.
The government of pupists "has experienced another failure when she wanted me to give up my functions (...), wanted me to commit a demise," said Zelaya Radio Globo on Thursday, in which she often expresses herself in a political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, and I've got an outcast president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and he's played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee of safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum request, said Interior Minister of the Pupuchian Government Oscar Raul Mate to the HRN Honduras Radio on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur Station, which has a seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure have mobilized in the middle of a step-by-step president who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military has strengthened protection.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the attitude of the Purgatory Government.
They show their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who was close to the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was dismissed on 28 June, on the day he organised the preparations for his re-election of the public consultation against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica unexpectedly returned on September 21st and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he'll be arrested, and he'll be held responsible for the crime of treason, which he's accused of, the Puchist government claims.
On 29 November, Puppet President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize presidential elections to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial elections recognised by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US balance of business encourages optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the results of the US trade balance testify to the rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with a technological dominance of 7,13 points to 21,90,06 points.
Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, it's added because the market is focusing on "half a glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on American balance sheet numbers, "which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The United States balance of business dropped by 7.6% in October, to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, the analysts expected an increase in the stairwell.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The great news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, Christopher Cornell of Economy.com research firm said.
However, in the United States last week unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new applicants for employment "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcusuiller from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The profit of the Treasury with a view to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and the return to 30 years has increased to 4,492% compared to 4,408% the day before.
Cuba : Hundreds of regime's advocates used "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime called on Thursday the wife of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights and prevented another demonstration that had been arrested by dozens of dissidents.
About 40 "Dam in White", a wife or close political prisoners were contacted directly on the street by the supporters of the Raul Castro regime in their march towards the centre of the capital, requiring the release of political prisoners, informed the journalist.
Away with the Yankees!, "Yolders!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" were chanted by the raised fists of the dissident regime.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came to "safeguard security".
The day before, in Havana, there was a similar manifestation against the "White in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, about ten dissidents were arrested by police in civilian territory, who were also going to manifest on Thursday on the occasion of World Day of Human Rights, the journalist AFP reported.
According to this journalist, the police imposed dissidents who were recruited by government officials into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours.
The leaders of Sakharov's 2005 European Parliament Prize, "White Houses" organised an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to the disent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as "iron" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A finished miracle, Cuban television reported a quarter-time manifestation of the supporters of the government regime against "responsors of the revolution".
Cuba and the Communist Party are regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disrespecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman killed an eighty-year-old man with a knife and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A lunatic armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five other people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an 80-year-old man in or before the pharmacy, 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, the version of the police and witnesses.
A severely injured old gentleman, born in 1929, died following the Allian Police Syndicate in the hospital for the consequences of the injuries.
In this pharmacy or before it, the attacker attacked the pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband about 30 years of age began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital in which an 80 - year - old man died.
The life of the second victim is in danger, according to police sources, apparently the vital organs have been hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "to shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as reported by a police source, then fled to the street, still on Jean Jarès Boulevard.
He injured two others, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
As it all happened, it's not quite clear, because it all happened in the evenings.
He was armed with two butcher knives, carrying a cross behind his back, said at the site the Alliance Syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, have tried to stop the madman and disarm him, according to the testimony of the AFP gathered.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commented on Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was thrown by a crowd, including one of the city police officers, who had broken his wrists.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to hold an armed man and were injured with their fists, reported a police source.
The incident took place in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
My neighbors came to tell me there's a injured person out there.
I went out and saw a man in his 70s on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a large wound on my abdomen, told the Agency of AFP Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, the second about thirty - year - old came in, and she also had stab wounds with a knife.
A man who didn't have identity papers arrested the police later.
The State Representative in Nanterre handed over the case to the Regional Police Investigation Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, waiting for questioning.
A police source did not exclude his placement in a psychiatric facility.
Another police source said it took six officers to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "extremely out of his mind" as "all lunatics of this kind whose power in action is increasing tenfold."
USA: Polanski Lawyer Asks Again to End Crimes · Global Voices
Polish-French director Romana Polanski again applied Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to stop a criminal prosecution against his client, currently in his Swiss residence because of the moral affair that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the film "Pianist" criticized before three judges of the appeal court of the second district in California the serious errors that occurred during the trial at the time of the 1977 events.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and immediately, said lawyer Hummel and added that from the behaviour of the judge who had decided in the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband "had a tingling in his back".
According to him, the judge (who had already died) had allegedly dealt with the prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison — a serious offense against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and directed" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the state's attorney himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he was lying to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will require the conduct of a trial in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The complainant repeated what he had already said in the first State, because there would be no serious examination of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski was brought to trial.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before the court ruled in a case of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a minor girl at the age of 13.
Since then, he has never entered the territory of the United States again.
Prosecutor's deputy in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to take part in the trial".
In this bail we would like to announce not only Romana Pole but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? Mrs Asayam asks.
It is the view that the director "requests kindness from the court and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed that there are other alternatives to escape.
Lawyer Hummel wasn't alone asking to stop Roman Polanski's prosecution.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also asked to stop the prosecution again.
She recalled that her client would no longer be able to endure the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case broke out and added: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the order of the United States
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to a house prison in his cabin in Gstaad, where he was waiting for a possible confession.
Wall Street ends in no direction, stopped by a rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Fridays in a straight direction, the market divested among indicators that are better than expected in the US and rising dollar price: Dow Jones won + 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average increased from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, with a technological dominance leaving 0.55 points and ending at 2,190,31 points.
Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106,41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It stays at a close range, the volume of the trade has decreased very much, and I think that's how it stays until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that were better than expected and which "helped to improve the mood on the market with regard to the stability of the economic recovery", said analyst Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November, the second month after each other and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from University of Michigan, the confidence of US consumers also returned and increased strongly to 73.4 against 67.4 in December in the previous month.
However, the indices have been stifled by a new increase in the dollar price towards the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
This is how tech stocks lose ground under their feet.
The securities market has fallen.
The return of the Treasury with a view of 10 years increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night and with a view of 30 years increased to 4,497% compared to 4,492% on the day before.
Miss World option again in South Africa.
After a month's journey across South Africa, 112 candidates for Miss World's title on Saturday are about to cross the target goal of achieving their dream: being chosen by the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion TV audiences.
This great beauty celebration was held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year and for the time being, five candidates have taken the lead in the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasakiová, Perla Beltra Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargboová from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbertara and Yanbing Maová from Canada were chosen Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real vortex of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences!
The competition, which takes place in South Africa after nine years, will be broadcast in direct transmission from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 hours (15 hours world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country where I put my crown on.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could experience it twice, confided in Miss of the World Xenia Sukhin, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous encounters with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "land that breathes out".
After months of performances, trials, press meetings, and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priyanky Chopra, elected in 2000, which also took part in the elections of Aishwary Rai, the winners of 1994 who both became the stars of Bollywood.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it's not just a look.
We're our country ambassadors, and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be played in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be introduced in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by the Chinese TV moderator Angela Chowová, former queen of the beauty of the South Africa Republic, Michelle McLean, and chairman of the Miss Committee of the World Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that it can welcome a warm world that is hard to cope with, said Julia Morley, the president of the Miss World competition.
The candidates took part in safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South Africa's President Jacob Zumou, who shook their hands.
Unusual for the president, she marked Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the settlement in Cape Town (south-west of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could've met people I never dreamed of.
I'm sure I'll go back to the 2010 World Cup, saying with the enthusiasm of Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, the Hallyday status reports are "very positive".
The reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
Reports are very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday when he left the plane, who arrived from Paris shortly after 13 o’clock in local time (21. world time)
The singer's son, who acted calmly, said that he would "get as fast as possible" to the Los Angeles Hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johny Hally was admitted on Monday due to post-operative infection following the operation of an inseparable interoperable interoperable plate that he had undergone on November 26 in Paris.
According to the press release, the singer of the night in Los Angeles was "put into artificial sleep" because of comfort, which should prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles already entered into artificial sleep. Hospitalization occurred due to an infection following surgery of a frozen interoperable plot of 26 November in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be back in surgery at night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a school presentation by French lycée in Los Angeles on Friday morning, visiting their daughter Jade.
The advantage of the department of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital la Pitie-Salpêtrière, Yves Catononi, announced that he was flying to the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer strongly accused Dr Stéphane Delajuxe, a neurosurgeon who operated on the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris on November 26th.
They told us it was a massacre.
The L.A. surgeons said they're under attack, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday" went too fast to Los Angeles and that was with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, as I had already suffered twice the threat of interoperable plots, he added.
A moment ago at the station the RTL radio said the singer apparently flew off after a Paris operation without a drill, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on the actress Maria Trintignat in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was working on at the time.
In 2007, Charlotte Gainsbourg, an actress, operated in the process of removing the haematoma resulting from the bleeding into the brain.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times condemned in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
The lawyer of the medical chamber, Olivier Metzner, referred to him as "a man without scruples", who is "normally" summoned to the medical chamber, and which can not even be "advised far away".
After a few days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself through his lawyer, David Coubbi, on Friday.
He announced that the procedure was "extremely good" and the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not haemorrhagic and therefore no introduction of the drainage was necessary", he added.
The health problems of the singer since this year are growing, and in any case it seems that his next tour remains with the questioner.
It is obvious that the date for the renewal of the planned tour on January 8 (In Amiens, no. red) appears to be too close, said Camus.
The UDF Group increases the tone and invites the Nouveau Centre to continue to use their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, responded on Friday to the attempt by the President of Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morina to take possession of the former Giscard party's short-circuitment in no media under the threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take possession of the UDF short of the fact that François Bayrou did not deserve to bear her legacy after giving his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is the partner of the UMP, was scheduled to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of Movement Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step has received support from a member of Hervé de Charetta (former za-UMP now for NC), who assigns to the property of the UDF brand because it was first registered in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la advanced industriale).
But on Friday night, the UDF-controlled friends of Françoise Bayroua, who do not intend to take possession of themselves, stepped out of his silence and submitted a formal request to the Minister and the Members to stop using the abbreviation and hand back the property of the trademark, under the threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the disturbing statement that you will propose to take over + the UDF again, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoD or Senator Jean Arthuis of Alliance centrist.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome web page of your movement name+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF today+, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which requests the NC movement to remove all UDF names from all promotional materials including (their) websites.”
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over possession of a trademark to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to ensure respect for the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, inform the signatories.
In their letter, UDF 's full-fledged political movement in 1978 'and reminds that Mr. Morin and his friends 'chosen' to leave in 2007 'to create a competitive movement, just like others in 2002 to establish an UMP.
The Nouveau centre movement therefore does not, according to them, have any right to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoD for three years and to set up a committee entrusted with the "moral and material interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's association.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when it registered a trademark", it was "never three years as a UDF member", but the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he used non-existent acronomy registration to do so on his own account.
This tact is beginning to turn into a criminal act, declare itself, and then speak with irony to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that, both in politics and in everyday life, it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to come out of anonymity by false acceptance of a name we have no right to".
Lillian Bettencourt's case : François-Marie Banier will be convicted of abuse of the condition of weakness.
On Friday, the Nanterre court decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier and to rule on whether he had used the weakness of an 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of a portion of her fortune, on which her daughter Lilian Bettencourt blamed him.
The photographer (62 years) known for his photographs of the famous will be convicted on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the abuse of the condition of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros.
This decision confirms that a bond process will actually take place, which can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, where the mother and daughter are attacked by each other and is fighting for the management of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heir and chief shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State representative in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010, while at the same time commenting on whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and at which time.
I think he's gonna step in.
I'm going to talk to her about things, and after the hearing, he said to Mrs. Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kiejman.
With regard to Advocate François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It's an excellent report. Expertise shows that with this old lady who needs protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), he confirmed.
It is two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and stunner who blames for using the condition of her mother's weakness for many years to earn a billion euros in checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Therefore, Lilian Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer whom she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of the action filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Friday court's speech of lawyers changed for a time in the family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters, which his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, expressing her mistrust for her husband Françoisy Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter dated 2003, Lilian Bettencourt, according to counsel, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years once or twice a day.
Ever since she married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State representative in Nanterre once again found that the complainant’s proceedings were not lawful, even more so that the custody judge in those days rejected her application to initiate proceedings for the granting of legal protection to her mother.
Lilian Bettencourt "is completely capable of participating in the court, not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for her," said the prosecutor's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
In the end, the Court ruled that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to speak at the time of the trial.
The executive revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was useless...
For more than ten years, it has been a reminder of the behaviour of management of large companies towards employees of companies' access to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to make the co-workers identify themselves with the "values" determined from the mountain, as before when it was necessary for consumers to import products that came from the ideas of the heads of factory techniques.
By becoming the centre of business companies, the customer compared the marketing revolution to the market's strategy in the right direction...and when authoritarian efforts to import products other than customer preferences are regularly returned!
Passive employee approach can lead to fatal demoralisation.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault companies are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which mainly affects managers.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "demands from all stakeholders an active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires employees to make commitments that are completely contrary to the revenue of authoritarian management.
We therefore call on the management revolution, which should aim to bring workers to the centre of interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal surveys of public opinion.
Internal public opinion surveys - as a questionnaire submitted by Orange employees - will contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that the new situation is in the face of the structure after different turnings will come first to... what she's always done!
It is also because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, is increasing in proportion to the seriousness of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they're high school graduates for engineers, they have mechanical interpretations of psychology.
Because of their mental comfort, they adopt an old behavioral theory, currently revived by the US's neurosciences and widely spread without any knowledge of the scientific institutions and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the levers (sic) of the managers' involvement, Ipsos' recent survey on Figaro.fr, which merely confirms the managers in their position of mechanical management, which is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises foresees the adoption of a final vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic perspective into all intentions and practices : for employees , commitments to the enterprise will be possible only if they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of motivation of employees deals only with the study Motivative Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of predetermined doxies that will allow them, through the image that speaks of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate on their "social performance" and introduce their human resources management "in the right way".
This creates a living ground for the development of solid and efficient economic intelligence.
By saying "just war" from Oslo, Obama earned praise from the right.
The American rights on Friday welcomed the speech Barack Obama presented the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize holder for 2009 was defending the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who at first ridiculed Obama's award of the price on October 9th this time were pushing the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, former vice president candidates in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, for the U.S. Today, and added that she herself had expressed herself in her memory on this topic "sometimes necessary" of the war.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do for work, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the sending of forces on Thursday in Oslo and used the speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the presidential reference to "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech quite historical, said Gingrich during the interview on the radio "The Takeaway".
The former Member, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was delighted to see the "left president" remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee that they themselves would not be free and could not pass on the price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama presented "a very American speech".
Not only did he portray himself as a "global citizen" as always, but he spoke as an American president and reminded the Europeans that they were living in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves and that they were not doing too much to keep it," said Gerson.
Among the few dissatisfactions of the right range are the Bush Age Hawk, former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, who described the speech as "single, bustling and without inspiration", as he said on the website of the National Review Online .
To the left of the President, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is terrified when he looks at Barack Obama, as he justifies the use of force.
"If we wrap war into the envelope of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the Middle-Leviation press stands out against the President for a praiseworthy opinion.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to regard the award of peace to Obama as premature, he assessed his output as "superficial", even for a speaker known as his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decision in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily writes with outrage.
Obama "proclaimed what was needed", evaluated the New York Times, and referred to the expression "as simple and instructive".
Road transporters: three marathons to an agreement that will save supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons, the trade unions of road hauliers and TLF, the only employers' organisation left until the end, on Friday evening, to an agreement that ended the call for a strike and a threat hanging over the supply of supplies at Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, during the Friday signing of the agreement, expressed "joy" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night the negotiators broke up early Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Even so, three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew.
But it took more than six hours for the meeting to begin at 11 hours for everyone to agree and at 18 hours for the signing of the agreement.
This conflict "would hurt businesses very much" and "would threaten to disrupt holidays at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The text contains a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries rises from €8.72 to €9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're giving our members a warrant not to get into the blockades, no blockades on the supply centres.
But there may be several other opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed the "true agreement", although it was difficult to admit the rise in high wages due to international competition."
According to him, there will be an increase of €170 per month for the lowest wages and €100 to €120 for the highest.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Doine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also foresees a 3% rebalancing of travel expenditure and a 3% report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the question of 13th pay and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the 'lowing by EUR 100 million on enterprise wage taxes' which was the subject of the government's amendment to the draft budget law for 2009, which was voted on at night on Friday at the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "corresponding" vote.
The signature allows for the agreement to apply first to undertakings that are members of this organisation to the entire branch, in the event of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible", assured Bussereau.
The whole process can be tainted only by the disapproval of employers' organisations.
FNTR is talking about "bad trade" because 100 million euro "was offered to the sector as part of the compensation of part of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport has forced us to act in an emergency, not because of mutual analysis, but because of the fact that he did not displease the turkey at Christmastime, he complained to Unostra.
For the Otre organisation, the agreement threatens to bury large numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: the weekend traffic interruption, the trade unions are not satisfied with RATP's proposals.
The suspension of transport on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday's meetings between the trade unions and the management of RATP on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the question of premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, that is, the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only ride between 10 and 20 o’clock on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) each train will ride, except for one train from four outside this section.
The link with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette business houses, which expect over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP was trying to secure connections with large business houses".
The RER A line leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train from two was in operation at the top and practically no set drove at the time off the top as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of Ile de France handled themselves differently, and there was no confusion on the platform.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people at the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station than usual, among other things because there were no students and students.
Jack Nbakina, engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he rose at "an hour and a half early to be sure he would arrive in time".
The Saint-Lazare Station was not overcrowded, the SNCF State Railway was notified, because more officials and guardians of order were predicted.
The suburban trains RER A operated SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare Station with a subway connection.
Another general meeting of the strikers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, at which they will evaluate the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the management, which the unions rated as "bad".
RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban RER trains and on all pages, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who require a earned premium, according to Thierry Garon.
RATP has even put down proposals for a premium for the time being, which has made CGT worse by saying that the management "was not able to solve the problem while it was possible for travellers and SNCF to do so".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "nearly reviewing the conditions of performance of the profession", RATP specified.
Which was the reason why the experts think the business "makes fun of weekend travellers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers were occupied by a business committee in its home in Paris.
The management, which has so far refused any discussion during the stand, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of "sleeping up".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread on Tuesday even on the RER B line, after Unsa and Independent announces a strike alert.
Committees are asking for a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, of which 30 euro of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent)) and making it difficult to work on this line, which transports millions of passengers daily.
The RER suburban train drivers earn 2,200 to 2,700 euros in gross wages and 600 to 650 euro premiums for irregular working hours and Sunday work and holidays.
Turkey's justice has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision brings with it severe consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to cancel the main pro-Kurdish parties in the country. This decision immediately sparked a protest demonstration in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can significantly complicate the task of the Government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it became a "domestic of activities threatening the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," President Hasim Kilic of the Supreme Court told journalists after four days of proceedings.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when most of the seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said that 37 party staff, including its President Ahmet Türk and Member Aysela Tugluková, were prohibited from participating in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluková and the confiscation of the property by the Ministry of Finance.
DTP has 21 chairs in Parliament (from 500).
The management of the party had already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of the proceedings initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "commands" of the Workers of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political altar of the rebels of PKK.
The Party shall ensure that there is no "basic link" with PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and invites the Government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit the Kurds' support to the KKK and end the conflict.
The DTP confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions on the south-east of Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained in clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before the DTP in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south-east, which are mostly inhabited by Kurds.
The police used tear grenades and water cannons, demonstrators were throwing Molotov's cocktails or firing stones from washing machines.
There were about a hundred people in Istanbul, too.
After the verdict, Mr Türk stated that the decision of justice only "proceeds despair".
Turkey cannot solve this question (Kurdů, see para.) by banning the party, said in the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also condemned this decision.
We're out of the principle of anti-distortion.
It doesn't solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total blow to the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from PKK, added.
On Thursday, PKK applied to one of the most murderous attacks on northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, he says the head of the winter department of FES technical services.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the driving techniques.
This weekend could be the first time that meteorologists have ever seen it.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES shall proceed according to the exact plan.
As soon as they snow in Frankfurt in general and the temperature drops below zero, they will travel to 20 so-called sections and a high-rise, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with descending like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, wet salt should be sprinkled within a maximum of three hours, which is better held, about 1040 kilometers.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "to keep the roads free when it starts to get to work".
It's tough when it snows only at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "because no one's willing to make a place for the bastards."
Only when it does not snow so much are the incoming and connecting communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES pedestrians will be on their way, preferably cleaning dangerous places and crossings.
FES can usually not take care of all cyclostasis.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which monitors the bridges from 22 to 4.30 above all, says Brauburger.
Since the iceberg is rapidly forming, it is going to go out as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees Fahrenheit.
The police will also call them if necessary.
Neckling of dinosaurs
Tawa Hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal had a long two metres and 1,50 metres high running around two strong hind limbs, had a long skull with sharp, bent teeth, short front limbs with sickle-joint claws and long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, nothing would have been extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the fourth edition of Science magazine say that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then located in the equator's dry area of Pangea's supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the former evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about kinship relationships, expansion and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt began and other paleontologists with excavations at Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes on one day, we found dozens of dinosaur bones, which is unprecedented for triassic sediments, informs team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were identified quickly by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, the remains were collected from a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual find: "Fosílie dinosaurs of triassium are very rare, usually only individual fragments."
Other experts on dinosaurs do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
Especially sensational is not this find, but confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are not complete, so the addition of pradinosaurs is mostly controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when the lizards were divided into three most important development lines: the carnivorous terropods, which later belonged to Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, the "long curvature" of four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the ornithischia (ptycopanas), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa Hallae is after analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues the original terrapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On Tawa Hallae’s skull, researchers found evidence of air bags that even the descendants of the terropods have birds.
Air bags make the breathing of birds more effective than mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive terrorist with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative lines of huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, it is likely that this useful innovation has already formed a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migratory waves into North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs have lived in South America so far, scientists have come to believe that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, three developmental lines were divided early and spread from South America to all the continents that at that time formed a single Earth mass as a supercontinent.
She would also speak of the fact that the team found with Tawa hallae the remains of two others, not particularly closely related terropods.
The three can't come from one common, immigrated ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, coauthor of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also differences.
Another older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to the group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bosnian paleontologist Martin Sander.
His idea could bring together a distorted image, because in South America very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, and other continents are rarely found.
As the dinosaurs have proved, from the relatively rare sidelines of the reptile family to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the ages of the Middle Ages, they are still a puzzle.
During the triassium, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
About the end of the triassium, dinosaurs spread to the world and many new species developed, while relatives died and the interfaces of triassium and jury.
Success story didn't last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been mass extinction, which the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better suited, so they could push out the competition.
The success story didn't last forever.
One hundred and fifty million years later, the impact of meteorite on another group of animals has also developed into triassium and since then lived in the shade of mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signers are international.
The list includes professors at University Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
The docks from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, or Bram joined.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University has taken care of the worldwide turmoil.
278 professors and lecturers at Goeth University, but also high schools all over Germany, Europe and North and South America solidarity with protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and in English, "don't approve" the president's ignited police intervention.
Since the walls were mutilated and the works of art, university President Werner Müller-Estler had to clear the building that students and lecturers occupied last week.
At the same time, five students were injured.
The damage to the case, the signers judge, does not justify "the violent disbanding of self-organised teaching of students and teaching by police command".
Exclamation represents "inadmissible intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "unjustice and criminalize protest" and draws attention to content.
The Bureau avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturers call for a halt to criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers did not support substantive damage.
Authorized protest
Young trade unions Verdi and the German trade union are also solidarityd with students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says the mysterious Earth youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hesen Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far defended the procedure of the universal president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destroying and occupying are totally unacceptable means, said on Thursday at Aktullen Stude (current hour) in the Wiesbaden Earth House.
We understand for the protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said the MP of the Earth House for the CDU, Peter Beath.
Otherwise, the opposition factions SPD, Greens and Linkes saw it.
The CDU takes the painted wall for an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of students, there was an elimination.
The links have submitted a proposal calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on police deployment.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it has been paid for a secret city that is not accessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow's capital, in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded site where secret military research was carried out.
Today, this area is considered 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, Green-town representatives have been in contact with the Frankfurt Riedberg Centre for Science - University Institutions and Companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits and signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg on Wednesday "The Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's Multi-Counterrestrial Jurij Rosljak and the Prefect of Zelenograd Anatoliy Smirnov, signed by the leading planner Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises involved in natural science research will go to the Zelenograd seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
FIZ's companies will be able to catch up on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutions and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Russia's electronics.
The period was established in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planned city" for military research.
Greengrad (literally translated "Green Town") has acquired its name according to the forested hilly landscape to which the research facilities are involved.
Stuttgart brake
The dimensions of Stuttgart 21 cannot be prepared at all.
For project supporters, it is quite simply 'new heart of Europe'.
S21 is more than launching stations, more than a monster building that will overthrow the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade into desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with rails that ended in the center of the city were then considered a 19th century transport-technical fossil that acts as brakes for modern rail transport, because it took an enormous amount of time to turn locomotives from the back to the front.
Hit it, stop it for a while, keep moving on - so it should work.
That's why the main station: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a train station lying about halfway across the route of the Trans-European Railway Motorway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislav - that's why this slogan about "the heart of Europe".
It really starts with S21, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves have learned that in the Hesen and Bavarian cities the start of the construction is almost unfunded.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor vehicles and steering vehicles at both ends, the main station has no problems with driving and driving.
However: It starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
Earth and municipal politicians have pushed it through.
The drugs cooperate, and because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is borne by the taxpayer and not by the state-owned companies.
Urbanistically, the project can be forgiven in some other way.
There will be a new urban space that, if we believe in designers' computer images, will contain many greens.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The railway station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - attributed a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights back then.
Modern transport policy must, however, be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is far greener than road freight car.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains because of the steep climbs.
Even more serious, the S21 is indirectly touching a lot of other railway projects.
A good six billion euros was to be buried in Sweden.
That's an official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other nodes and narrow spots in the network.
There are 60 major projects on the Ministry of Transport list.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometers of long trails along the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been slowed down.
This should be a lot of pressure.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The route along the Rhine Valley will become the throat of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government examines the airport judgment
In the Wiesbaden Chamber of Earth, the earthly government left open if it went against the judgment of the Hesen Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban on night flights and let him review it.
The CDU/FDP has commissioned experts to give more than 400 pages of the VGH ruling in law, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today stated in writing that the state would have to adjust the night ban on flights in the event of construction of the planned north-west of Frankfurt airport.
The authorization of 17 years between the 23rd and 5th hours, as foreseen by the Government of the Earth, does not correspond to the law governing the protection of the population against night air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4th if it will require a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this postponement and traveled to the Government to deny the revision of the General Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The Head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to the promises regarding the ban on night flights it had given before the election. Otherwise it is possible to evaluate this as "the breach of the word".
It's damn hard, if you can keep your word, said the head of Green Tarek Al-Wazir in the opposition to the FDP election slogan "We hold the word".
Minister Posch rejected the reproach of Schäfer-Gümmel, the government of the land is trying to get to its nighttime flights through "the twisting of law and tricks".
Accurate legal control needs its time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on the "fast first impression" basis.
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The comments of his faction on the ban on night flights were never the same as those of the opposition.
US banks repay aid
American, crisis-shaking big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
The Bank of America paid out a total of $45 billion (about EUR 30 billion) of assistance from the Tarp Bank Savings Fund on Wednesday.
According to the U.S. station CNBC plans to pay off state aid, Citigroup also.
The constitutions therefore want to remove the restrictions that have been imposed by the adoption of money - the limitation of the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has secured $19 billion in net cash from investors thanks to convertible bonds.
The rest of the amount was taken from its treasury, which was filled, inter alia, by trade unions.
The Chief of Bank Kenneth Lewis thanked the US taxpayer very much on Wednesday evening: The money injection helped us overcome a difficult time.
The monetary institution has damaged itself at the top of the financial crisis by taking over Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to free itself from its obligations vis-à-vis the state by also providing money on the capital market.
With reference to the resources, CNBC informed itself that this US bank could have announced on Thursday a capital increase of about $20 billion.
Citigroup didn't want to say anything about it.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid off in June.
Quick Choice
It was only faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor only two weeks after the ZDF board expelled Director-General Nikolaus Brender from the office.
Last night, the Grimm was about to come to an agreement on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF study in the capital city of Berlin, was named as a favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it, officially, so the trial doesn't go ahead.
However, the role could also be played by not wanting to hurt the ZDF Commissioner Markus Schächter if this proposal did not go through with the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine out of 14 gremies.
The result of the vote was not known before the conclusion of this publication.
Two weeks ago, Schächter, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Brender had only seven votes against him, seven against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it could be expected.
The majority of the Union’s board of directors had signalled several weeks before the elections that it did not want Brender to confirm.
The Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch opposed the editor.
He refused to remain in the office of the high-ranking editor by arguing that Brender had been subject to quotas for monitoring the ZDF broadcast.
Until recently before the election, protests were therefore strongly critical of the political influence on the ZDF.
Finally, even 35 state lawyers were placed in the debate, who regard the Koch procedure as anti- constitutional.
It wasn't worth it.
Of a person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, education and romance.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reporter of the head of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 Head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the main study of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday as an expert periodical of the Middle Magazin Journalist of the year, was dismissed, Zelenje was announced to file a constitutional action.
Koch's anti-candidate at the board of directors, Rhine-Falk Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the contract with the ZDF so that the staff proposals of the authorising officer cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF supervisory councils.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, took on the board with a smart chess move - immediately after Brender's planting, he criticized for the severe thunder.
With this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him to the post of editor without losing his face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without being suspected of being pushed into office by the party.
In the lateral arrhythmetics, Frey is immediately assigned to the left-wing liberals.
The studio is getting rid of the harpsichords
Partly success for students: After the year of the strike, the ministers of culture finally arrived in the Federal countries on Thursday: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors, both parties agreed that they would be willing to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the test load: In principle, each study module should end with one single test.
In addition, there should be a review of the workload of students, and a "real and justifiable rate" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and colleges want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The common countries undertake to create a more flexible common structural task for bachelor’s and master’s study fields.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the start of student protests in June, the ministers of culture and university rectors have had a word of better study in their mouths.
Now for the first time, they're filled with concrete content.
The so-called accreditation board has resolved that the number of tests is reduced in part by a drastic reduction: "Every module will usually be completed only once a test", says the 30-page report, which is partly to regulate the approval of study fields.
"A markedly lower test load," said the Chairman of the Accreditation Board of Reinhold Grimm, "the faulty development which significantly reduced the challenge of the study is to be stopped."
To this end, "studies" should be a "defining criterion" for implementation in the future.
Modules and contents "must be strictly checked" in order to "not unduly limit students in choice"
"seminars."
Students should have "the right to a space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules are to apply when approving new study fields, after examination, but also for existing study courses.
You need to "predict" every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 before all study courses are rechecked.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards established by the federal countries.
In October, cultural ministers called on the "mighty" partner countries to act on agencies to ensure that the full teaching was not too large and the testing regime was not strict.
In the various federal countries, universities and universities have already agreed with the Earth ministries on appropriate measures.
As yet, the only country has promised the Rhine-Falcko additional resources for further development of the Bologna Process.
From money, colleges should first and foremost build consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen testing and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a new higher education law into Parliament.
According to her, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, to which recognition of the exams from other universities should be guaranteed and the master's access should be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all study fields in the country should be re-examined.
The government and opposition renegotiated on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
Criticism of the resolution also fell among the praises.
The Juso Association of Higher Education Groups has called for the creation of education policy not to take place in the future "at the closed door" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, the students, as the persons concerned, should speak at least a word.
Future academics also received support from the president of the conference of higher education rectors (HRK), Margrethe Wintermantel: "We need students' experience", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture with whom the HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Committees of Education and Science (GEW), the Bosnian resolution did not go far enough: it requires a legal claim that would enable each graduate with a bachelor's degree to access the master's course.
Secondly, the federal states must ensure that, for today's generation of students, baccalaureate industries have enough seats tomorrow in the master's study fields with the best possible study conditions, said a board member of GEW Andreas Keller.
The common countries must employ far more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not express themselves freely in the master's programmes.
More than a note by Herta Müller.
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by Werner Söllner, who in this torn language piece deals with the experience of the arrival of a dissident who gained freedom but also lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of one book publishing house, 1982 moved to Frankfurt above Mohan.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hesen Literature Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
He took care of a significant extraliterary disturbance last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts".
Apparently, the insidious and infected Söllner left a statement in which Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totuk, Franz Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer, admitted to cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some present, Söllner won a German language price in 1989.
Attempts of recruiting began inconsequentially, first in 1971.
I, continued Söllner, "someone who has not defended enough attempts at intimidation from Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of Nobel Prize Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary settlement with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government, the literary scene, and in particular the German community of authors originating in Romania, has been shaken by a case that marks the depth and disgrace of the political system, which is based on control and scrutinizing.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In Securitate's files, secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and turned to a positive influence on himself by secret agent Walter.
"He was cutting me up" at the time in all the essential points for him, says Markel.
It has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was in this form and before this audience was unexpected but absolutely surprising the confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote in July when she read her own files, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for spicy Securitate.
The complaints, they can be assumed, will speculate, and in some cases probably know what name is hidden behind a cover named Sorin, Voic and Walter, too.
Unlike in the country, in the meantime, a very certain view of the Stazi files is still very difusional to manipulate the rest of the Securitate control.
In recent years, systematic education has been marred and limited.
One of Birthler’s offices, which is responsible for the processing of Securitate (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, and the issuance of the Act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 is there a law governing the management of the files.
That former members of the Securitate still had a strong influence in Romania, after the Nobel Prize was published for Herta Müller, one interview in which one of the former Securitate chiefs of Temeshvar commented on the award winner's rejection.
She says she's psychosis, after all, she's only been interrogated once.
The demise of power has been expressed in an undisclosed way in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Söllner, as in connection with the silenced guilt, questions are inherent.
Special reactions of the listeners to Söllner's confession make him expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the cry of guilt and shame.
To the genius of Herta Müller's work, which accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it's more than a footnote.
Saturated deposit of Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed business representative came from a cute Christmas party, where he was handing out sweet sports goods to the sportsman when he got up for a quarter of an hour after midnight in the invited Mercedes class C new coach VfBr Christian Gross accompanied by an orange coloured sponsor bag.
A man with a Moroccan baldie was allowed to drive around in another strange town.
Otherwise he could drive himself-- alcohol wasn't in the game, and drunk luck was a 55-year-old man too.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow's work will continue.
Or it'll just start.
The words of only three days' engagement with Switzerland: "We have achieved eight-finals", namely in Champions League thanks to win3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be impressed with success: it will be a brutal hard fight against accession."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mohučí performance from the royal class even on ordinary league days.
And to avoid again obvious weaknesses after three quick goals of Mary (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pořebnyaka (11).
Elevation
The 8th Champions League (meeting 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Retaliation 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be held in Lyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the shriek of Babbel’s successor will be preserved.
Not only was the supposed healer who gave the uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to set up and enjoy the game during a short period of time.
I went to the players and told them they were to focus on their strengths and I urged them to be bolder, explained the healer of the soul Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, however, did not prove any more effective for the treatment of Babbel.
He fanned a certain magic, acknowledged Babbel's follower Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the football game, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khadira, who after many weeks of interruption due to injuries, became the best player on the field because of his dynamism, tried to describe the identified "phenomén" by the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new superior: "It is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
It was obviously missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, sports president Horst Heldt warns
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate the victory against a weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after the 0:4 slaughter in Leverkusen, thinking of Kheedir.
And Sports President Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal has been achieved in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not in the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after the first home victory after three months, was caused by weekend events that were freshly relived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that make different, not Jens, that have taken Heldt away from the hard criticism of Lehmann.
He cast out weak leadership to the board and decided to change the coach after the pressure of teenage fans.
Even by canceling his day off after the games, Lehmann marked as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "form clean egoism", separated Heldt and announced consistency for goalkeepers.
I don't think both 40s are gonna be happy about life anymore.
In any case, they are one with others, that without the job of the team of coaching, it would not be possible to have such a playful and fighting performance.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share in success", says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the Igelite sachet agrees.
The match of the world's heavyweight championship
Your duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world champion Vitalija Klička.
However, after twelve tough bikes, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavy weight of the boxing organization WBC.
The referee's verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klička remains the champion of the world in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated Kevin Johnson on Saturday night in Bern by one vote on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klička it is the third successful defence of the title after his return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukraine was twice the champion of the world by WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be the ones everyone was expecting.
The match improved his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional battles, twice beaten for injuries.
The challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th fight.
Approximately 17,000 spectators in the Berlin arena drove the 2,02 metres high Klička fight mainly with its left hand.
At 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced before the duel the end of the Kliček era, had withdrawn before the blows of the world master, so Kliček could not strike decisively with his dangerous right hand.
In total, passive Johnson made quite a few calls to the challenger, and he was just trying to get into the next laps.
Although Klička provoked words and gestures, his blows but the world's master scored only rarely.
But still, it's only the second boxer after Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klick full of twelve rounds.
The challenger took care of the riot in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He insulted Klička as a "disgusting zombie" who "can't do anything right."
During his respects on Friday, the champ got provoked, pulled Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "so he could see his eyes".
A fourth victory after Kliček's return
The match remained undefeated after the fourth fight after its return on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of break, he defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight before.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in his defending title.
In this fight, I only got one shot, and physically, I'm in good shape, justifying a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains a defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt is worn by Brit David Haye after he disembarked from the throne in November 2,13 metres from the High Nikolai Vulaje.
Haye refused to fight Klikov in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
Apparently, his promotional company is planning a fight against Kličko in the Wembley Stadium of London.
Kundúz case
The front attack from the opposition: Green Faction Chief Jürgen Trittin pointed out because of the bad news about the Kundúz Aféry Minister of Defense Guttenberg as a liar.
SPD and Linke (Left) call on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of the attack on Kundúz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said "knowly not true" to the death bombing of two tanks in September, said the head of the Green Jürgen Trittin faction on Saturday's news show ARD "Tageschau".
Let's call it the usual expression, "I lied."
The killing order was issued in disregard of the rules of the International Security Support Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only the destruction of stolen trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In an American raid requiring German Commander Kunduzu Colonel Klein, NATO investigation found that up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Greenery, SPD and Linke called on Saturday by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Parliament and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy of the targeted killing is part of the Afghan Community House Policy - and, if the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved the new strategy, called on Jürgen Trittin and the Green Renate Künast colleague.
Ulrich Wilhelm’s speaking government has definitely rejected criticism.
The Chancellor's Office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, the Ministry's concerns about the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert were also voiced.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs were informed correctly and completely of the background of the attack on tanks.
Officially it was said that they should deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the Minister with sensitive details.
However, in the vicinity of both top officials, it was said that they had alerted the Ministry of Defence even to a number of reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and one report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had been asked in the meantime to clarify the situation in a letter.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not address the charges and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the Investigation Committee of the Association Chamber, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in a watchful state and hear voices that others do not see and hear.
Not just mentally ill or drug intoxication, they cross the line between imagination and reality.
As long as it occurs in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with the wildest notions and fantasy delusions.
However, those who are conscious of the condition of dreams see and hear things that others do not see and hear do not hear, in today’s Western world most of them pay for fools or drug addicts, or at least as a strange thing.
However, such images and voices do not occur only in the case of the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
The wine has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, will take care here and there to bridge the line between dreams, imagination and reality.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can occur in various forms, we better call them visions, in worse delusions.
Even though the initiator and effect may differ, the visions of the Hildegard von Bingen Mystique, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castandy, the shaman states of delusion, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions will occur if the balance of neural transmitters of the brain occurs - mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenia psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The link between delusion and dream has been occupied by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in a watchful state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, observed in 1861 "a great similarity to delirium with substance," for Sigmund Freud even "psychosis, with all the nonsenses, delusions and delusions".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and shriek-colored.
Gravity has no power over him, hovers at the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling a kick.
Behind him winged devil figure with bloody red grimas, appreciating teeth.
They chase him, they kick him with heavy, fire boots, they throw him over the wall, they feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from the wall and the radio.
He can't stand the voices they're giving him and insulting him anymore.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, plugs them in the loop and puts it on a hook on the ceiling.
He's gonna climb up on one speaker, and he's gonna put a loop around his neck.
Jumpers.
The loop allows.
Learn, cry out in the congregation's voices tearing out his bubbles, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he's had six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
The LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, but it's maniodepressive, taking antidepressants, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts, he says.
Miracles are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people get sick at least once in their lifetime of schizophrenia, and in psychiatric clinics it's after the depression of the second most frequently treated disease.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the patients cannot distinguish the inner and outer world, they get into an awakened state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationships illusions or illusions of persecution.
The hearing of votes is particularly widespread - the voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Not even optical hallucinations are unusual.
The affected is unable to distinguish important from the minor, the brain cannot filter disruptive signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
As the dream opens, psychosis has created a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, the chief physician of the General Psychiatry of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizofrenik is located in the center of action, everything is relevant to it.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, it becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizofrenic therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Compared to reality, most of them are not possible, ghosts are a terrible fact, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime, experience hallucinations.
Other than in a dream, Fuchs says, "it remains a sensual and spatial structure of a fact that one perceives in a psychosis, essentially preserved."
Deceptive thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of experience occurs within a real framework.
Scientists are still in the face of a riddle why our brains do such things.
Exceptional states can lead to a short - term loss of a relationship to reality, Fuchs says.
Not everyone will develop into psychosis.
It appears that there is a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists suggest that the disabled have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development there will be damage to brain neural remission, such as maternal viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
However, it remains a puzzle as to how a neuronal system will be disrupted, which did not appear in any way during the long years.
Roles also play the effects of the surroundings - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if there is a disposition to it.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain boils
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer with their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychologist Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we see delusions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, interpreting his results last year in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Real World in Our Head).
Hallucination is part of the typical accompanying phenomenon of psychosis, but also of the surprising many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, he is hallucinating under certain conditions the very brain of a healthy person.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are too active or a little suppressed; if our brain boils, or when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can run this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, concern with love or other exceptional circumstances.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Primary Pomerania and attends a gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren't any pictures and voices.
Breaks can be caused by a cologne with long, dark hair.
When he answers, the class is looking at her with surprise -- no one else sees and hears this boy.
This shy girl thinks she's uptight, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows.
He's awake, he hears, and he sees this boy, just like he hears, and he sees a girl sitting next to him in a bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a pleasant feeling, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions aren't real and he'll disappear again.
In the night, the revelations are rather glamorous.
Too many people are too heavy.
When sitting in a classroom, he can't follow the lesson many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else clearly and visibly on the mathematical equation table.
In the night, the apparitions are more depressing.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, he often cannot distinguish whether he is up or if he is asleep, whether the images he sees are shivers or the girl with bleeding cutting wounds on her hands and feet appear before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he's screaming at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
In autumn 2009, Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year, she made a senior and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations settled.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Casten on the Internet, she knows she hasn't gone mad.
Prejudice is also an art of despair
If a person is socially isolated or gets stimuli taken, he will be highly likely to hallucinate, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough work to do, and it takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she found out at 13 that the man she's been calling dad ever since she thought was not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for disabled people like Sarah K. to distinguish from themselves delusions and reality. "Every experience," Kasten says, "it takes place in the brain, it also shows reality there.
Hallucinations are also images that let the brain form, so it works so realisticly."
He also evaluates Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people is not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Therefore, Kasten advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border condition between sleep and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world focused too much on consciousness, the imaginary experience is generally pathologicalized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and head of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic clinics at Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, patient disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - too, delusion is art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams which the person concerned considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them back from the watchful state.
Oneiroid consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience full - consciousness motor blockage.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, like a persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces life threatening a real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The type of borderline between sleep and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to cope with some situation, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intensive form of support for senses and the transfer of senses into an unbearable situation that enables people to be able to form themselves, to move in time to a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memories.
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Clausen describes his oneioid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Heart language) as a life-saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after surgery, a heart valve with subsequent heart transplants appeared to his consciousness on a several-day journey, with his body lying motionless on an intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into the world he had created, visiting strange times and places: becoming an old man tied to a bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages between nobles, which produce phantoms from blood.
He'll be taken by the River into his own country on his motorcycle, surfing on his hospital bed in the Alps and meeting a Korean mob.
It's going down completely into the imaginary thing, everything's real, and later on in memories.
These internal paths are fundamentally different for Claussen than any dream.
The dream is a different condition, describing its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are clear for years and in minor details.
Even clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizons of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile our internal images of external reality are even in the watchful state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "may lead to deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow may come
Burda
In 27, children are to be taken over by the publisher
The new editor Kallen is a transitional solution: In the long term Hubert Burda wants to hand his business into his two children's hands, he told SPIEGEL.
Holding also has 100 percent family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business long in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says 69 - year - old man SPIEGEL.
We dealt with the details carefully.
The question is, if they're also active in the company, it's only after that.
I wonder if they have the ability to do that.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees of their children at the head unless they are capable enough.
That would kill both kids and businesses.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he had been withdrawing from the Presidency since January and appointed as his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Since 1999, Kallen has been a board member for Burdy.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with a section of the Treasury, she added responsibility for the company's assets and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer also Straight Marketing, Cizina, Print and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's kids are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who today would have been 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's name is also used to "closure 10, 15 years", said Burd.
Holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
In view of the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda expressed himself that even family businesses had no confidence before the collapse: "It was always the company that had been infected with the desire for capital that they speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had dreams of world power, Burd says.
I don't feel like this country's political preceptor, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these stores are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming up, and this is the time when it is appropriate to find out what the celebrities are wearing, and adapt your own birthday dresser to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which must be kept in mind.
We're making a few suggestions.

Endesa and Barcelona, with an electric motor
Endes' energy company, along with Barcelona City Council, was founded by the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalan.
The LIVE's Office (Logistics for the introduction of electric vehicles) shall establish and manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and ensure agreements in the field of mobility, shall manage, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop projectsMOVEL, promote electromobiles, collect opinions and results in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport in the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project for the introduction of electromobiles in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
It is three cities that have chosen the government within the MOTEL Plan to support the introduction of electromobiles.
Endes' energy company has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related and, above all, energy-efficient activities.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero's predicting a calm period' for the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish car industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a "cold period".
In the 2009 economic report of the Prime Minister Zapatero summarised the measures introduced during the year in support of the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitive Plan for the automotive sector, we would now be awaiting a state of abandonment, the conclusion of some of our main production companies," the Prime Minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the wishes of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of serenity for this industry is foreseen in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that a competitive plan forming part of the Integrated Car Sector Plan (PIA) identified 800 million for projects of 19 producers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilised investments exceeding EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended to develop new models, to modernise production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's support measures and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being implemented in cooperation with autonomous areas and automotive brands.
According to the President, this plan allowed for a reduction of 6% of the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, and ensured a "significant increase" in entries, namely in November by "40%".
20,000 square metres of conventional vehicles
In Madrid, the first International Balloon of Classic Vehicles will be opened, which is a place for professionals and amateurs from the engine world to meet.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Madrid Casa de Campo Glass Pavilion.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, where more than 200 foreign and domestic exhibitors will be represented.
Here you can find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will also be products of all types connected to the engine world.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products relating to classical engines, true collectors and curiouss.
Among the participating companies will be the following:Clasicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francesco Pueche, sale and renewal of cars; or Cochera Clásicos, specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Exterior eligibility tests
In addition, the commercial activities of this parlor will be complemented by parallel activities: focus, sports performances, examinations, presentations and contests.
Also, the eligibility tests for conventional cars and motorcycles in the adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone will be carried out.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sport style conservation
Mazda intends to show that the environment's safety does not have any negative influence on the sport style.
And that's why Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start-up system - baptized also like-Stop-, which is currently only available with a 2.0 150-horse gasoline engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle implementation, population, behaviour, mechanics, i-stop system...
All these aspects are excellent for Mazda3.
Front seats incl. driver seats have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
With tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda continues in Japan's tendency to develop futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a significant red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of a style that also presents Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese and both, contrast with the soberness of German products and, more specifically, with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As is usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish a very comfortable ride.
In addition, there is a need to mention large luggage space and regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start-up system is only available with a two-litre gasoline engine and 150 horsepower assay manual transmission.
This engine is a real load. It is very fine, is characterized by reduced noise, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most requested Mazda3 is in a diesel version, all those who do not arrive so many kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, because it is more comfortable when driving and reduced consumption.
With regard to equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of series elements.
In the case of serial equipment, mention should be made of a system for the monitoring of lanes (RVM), which prevents the formation of dead angles, control of thrust and stability, control of speed, internal mirror sensitive to light, large-screen onboard computer, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, sensor of rain and lights, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels of 17-inch alloy.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, with an additional EUR 1,500: adaptive lights twoxenon and a BOSE sound system with a CD handle, except for other parts.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is mainly characterized by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not visit more miles per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a gasoline engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is EUR 21.770 for Luxura and EUR 23.270 for the tested version -Sporative-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a large amount of satisfaction for each day.

The promise of FonBek
Peek is extremely limited, it only serves to browse mail, without being able to browse a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine rated him as one of the year's products.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is marked by very low price and monthly payments, less than half of the amount, which applies for example to the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new facilities: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, for which it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
FonBeek, who was introduced at the Le Web event yesterday, is the European version of invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It's limited as well as its American counterparts, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros a month and includes roaming all over Europe.
People with smartphones already know what it means to lose their data service after crossing the borders or eagerly search for a coffee shop with WiFi (or Fon connection) to see the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate from physics to understand them, as well as very good glasses, to be able to read a miniature letter.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they can be accessible to the whole of Europe, which still has no bearing effect.
There is cause for concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device such as FonBeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon if it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider various offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering downloading books and other searching on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This facility is connected and paid for purchase, not for months.
And that's exactly what I expect one day to happen in the case of FonBeek, it's a possibility to buy with a permanent approach like Peek has already been introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the post office on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it's the best type from a consumer's point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in the computer.
A Color That Honors Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the USA.
For Barack Obama to become president of the United States she chose her dress and coat in this color, also choosing the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: passing the Nobel Prize for Peace in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow with glittering effects-, in both cases it was a three-part set - dress, bag and coat of the same substance - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States had decided to follow the steps of the Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothing is made makes both models quite different.
On the occasion of her entry into the function of Michelle, she used a large piece, in Oslo velvet with printing.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with medium-high heel, now similar model, but in gold color.
She also wears different hairstyles: this time shedrdol, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related problems with their motherhood.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially in the case of younger women who are planning to have a child.
This is the result of a study by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute on Fertility and the Working Career of Spanish Women.
The study was attended by 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to maternity.
The study emphasises that there are many differences at the start of partnership in the views on the number of children according to whether they work or not, as well as by the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with their partner before they have the first child and have more children in general.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnership and motherhood, delay and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years of age with stable employment have on average the first child 3.7 years from the start of cohabitation with the partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted most of their life to the achievement of their stable employment and have had to postpone partnering and children's arrival.
The type of profession also has a strong impact on motherhood, although less influence on the time of the start of cohabitation with the partner", explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and birth is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
Differences are also among women of the same generation.
For example, in age groups 35 to 49, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at age 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education are married and have the first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or higher education take the lead in gaining stable employment, before marriage and the birth of the first child", says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Orial Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since next year, a German actress will become the face of the various products of this brand under the universal motto 'Cause I'm worth it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, is thus added to the next famous personalityL'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Even before her they joined this selected actress club Evangeline Lilly ('The Loss') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the House').
The master part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by significant personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey''s anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'The Lost').
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to talk about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, former and current - met at the annual price transfer, which took place in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen the best model of the year.
Poker Manuel Vicetta
Manuel Vincent presents thirty X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases also in his normal life).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vincent does not save light or inspiration.
This book is an excellent readership, even at repeated reading.
I'm giving you some insights here.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of doom, the morals without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "The Nyhilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without any sense of sense, as if it were a blade of knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been ahead of his passion for this woman for 13 years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege for reaching heaven by the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in the universal literature, which must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
Alone, he said about himself that he was the heir of a shipowner from the countess, another time he was the son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge a confused scream of this man from Munich to bring his echo to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running from himself and calling to the future and talking sharply to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker, "One of them was kneeling down and praying, "My beloved God, make me stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "In his grave were the Spenser's poems: 'After his efforts comes a dream, after a storm of calm port, after the war of rest, after a life of death."'
About Virginia Wolf: "He also took his depression in his luggage.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Eduard VII had been watching her among the asylums or that the birds had been singing Greeks.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What else did Martin Santos have to do with targeting Joyce at Baroë?
What else did Benet do before he let Baroi execute Faulkner's gun?
What else was the matter with Cele than to make himself famous at the expense of the glory of that man?"
Poor Aggression
Last week my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrada district, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed round and our dog, the crosses rescued from a shelter with a weight of up to six kilograms, twice beaten and severely injured without a single word.
Our outrage is greater that we see nothing fun in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on the leash.
And to that shock the old lady after this incident, when she confronted these individuals on a walk, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil possessed by an animal is able to do the same to a woman, child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than he himself.
It happened at 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, usually in a quiet neighborhood.
A dog cried all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint against the nearest commissioner, but we doubt that it was something to raise sensitive questions, we find that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationalities.
Our indignation led us to declare that fact.
We do not understand what is happening to today’s youths when they enjoy the suffering of a defenseless animal who gives us love, companionship, and friendship.
We don't understand where proper discipline has gone, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Festial together for the use of helmets
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Security Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as these two entities have reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of using helmets, as it is the only means to prevent head injury, where appropriate, death in the event of accident when riding a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of their transport safety obligations, which "is more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirms that it seeks to fulfil this objective in other ways, in the form of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets when riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first stage when up to 500 repairs of motorcycles will be placed on the agenda to get to the public's most aware.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport security "is a constant problem" of this company, which is a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles increased
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain marked an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, the first increase after 22 months of permanent failure, according to numerical data from the patronage organisation of the Anfac producers and the vendors of Ganvam.
However, a favourable indication is better to quarantine, as November 2008 is a significantly poor comparison period and represented a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: car derivatives, pick ups, deliveries, smaller trucks and light trucks/carriers.
And even though private persons bought them, the majority of purchases were carried out by small and medium-sized companies and the ratio in 100% of cases was financed through third parties.
Further factors such as halting or continuing a bad economic situation should be added to the constraints resulting from the closure of a bank credit source.
In the situation in question, unlike passenger cars, the purchase aid 2000E did not help too much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention individuals who do business on the business list of small and medium-sized companies who intend to buy a light utility car up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 level not exceeding 160 grams per km, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ghana again recalled the need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The sales association expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to the calculation of sales in passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The hand brake system is already a mandatory equipment.
As with the ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with the control of the stability of the ESP, the auxiliary hand brake systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European vehicles.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light utility vehicles, while others have a fixed deadline for the elimination of the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians by acting in a way that can help prevent many precipitation.
The auxiliary hand brake system increases the pressure on brakes in an emergency, which the system finds after the driver has stepped down.
But he can't always keep this pressure up until the end.
According to a study carried out by Bosch’s car parts manufacturer, a third of the drivers who had an accident did not scrape the brake before the impact and half of them did not fully use the brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires the maximum braking system to reduce the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians per year could be avoided.
Reducing this number will be even more marked-as calculated would prevent one of four accidents with impact on persons-after the introduction of so-called intelligent hand brake systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system which (aiding radar or cameras) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver fails to respond, even if the brake cannot be prevented, the device shall affect the brake as intensively as possible and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figuereelas ( Zaragoza), that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably 8 April- as told by Javier Ortega, the American producer points out that it will take more time to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed to by the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
On the contrary, GM ensures that the Saab sale decision should be taken on those days.
No wonder the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American producer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One might be Geely, who also wishes to obtain Volvo, but considers the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, who acts under the auspices of the Russian Converg group.
In the event that it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab to Baic.
It continues to be valid to close Saab at the end of the year unless it can be sold.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
When developing this excellent model, engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, therefore weight shows only 1,275 kg.
On the basis of this, in the first instance, the automatic pull-out roof is in a canvas with manual controls, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; the aluminium doors such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a reduction of weight by another 7 kg; after the installation of the sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to the lightened 19inch wheels more than 5 kilos.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing door grabs with textile captures means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a two-connected PDK transmission, one vehicle with a hand-ordered six-degree gearbox was tested, mainly on the second-class roads in California, on the mountain sections with many interlocked turns.
His behaviour can only be qualified as untouchable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle is not pressed to the asphalt.
Rather on the contrary: we have not tested such a small and light model for a long time that would also convey such safety while moving in the corner, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete capable of warming up muscles on a short ride at the right time until we get him sprint, braking, and restoring the use of the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the drive that's as communicative as it is accurate, whatever we put on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he'll perform it with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound according to will
The V6 boxer sound, by 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is very gifted and can be strengthened by the 'sport' option and by a system that modifys the sound of an engine that has already been used in Panama.
The rate of acceleration is brutal, whether at sucking or recuperation.
The curtains are fixed, but not rigid or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads that we're driving through with Boxster Spyder were pretty damaged, but the car was good with the excuses.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the trip, and at some turns we encountered a flashlight even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultralight vehicle is one of the most fun on the market, as it is a bit more than just modifying Boxster S.
The car will be placed for sale in February 2010 at a price of €70.831.
"Bag Girl"
A friend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon series and an occasional "starlette" at the firmy shows, the singer shows her face of an evil girl as cheetahly as her Chanel purses.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia Empowered in Israel
Workbook won a brilliant victory in 82-91 during her visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences in Duska Ivanovice, and this led her group after a great performance by Mirja Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the team (29 reviews).
Vitoria has been able to replace Herrmann's significant absence, Olesona, Huertase or Micova with a large amount of planting and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to win the victory.
In addition, great accuracy from the circle with 16 triple points was involved in the final triumph.
The match began with the lead for the blues who stood on the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance that indicated that they had attacked the Israeli cooperative very severely.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavian team decided for the internal game Baraca and Eliyah's work, which was accepted by sand and applause when they returned to their original facilities to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to express himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although six in Splitter's evaluation already indicated that it would not be the best night for Brazil.
But even though the match was sharp until the breakup, it was not decided at all, and the Macabees wanted to remind Vitoria that everyone on their field was not winning, and with Eliase's hand they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnin have certainly contributed to returning to the embassy (50-49).
More inappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, wounded, but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to take a breath, and then came up with a machine gun called Mirza Teletovic, which three tripled almost by itself and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a soothing number (54-67), which reached local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Alavs took their skin off in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not be allowed to be deprived of the earned results of the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnin and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and try to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and Splitter voted against the Faul SeIvanics did not tighten and defend themselves well, and although the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Wounds prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unikaja lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left him the leadership of Group B in Eurolysis in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but especially the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Maliga community has not been concerned with Pavilion's environment of peace and friendship or rivalry, perhaps one of the more ill in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in each other, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Rubia, brightened the field from 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity ofunicaja , although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousis , Vujice and Schortsanitis , turned the score 22-20 , minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the resistances of USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek cooperative began to function and demonstrated its superiority in both zones, where the lack of English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal errors of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja
Between internal players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible Retaliation
The third part was very offensive by Olympiacos, who, although losing by 19, proved the advantage and even managed to offset the difference from the game in Malaza Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unikaja was trying to overcome her absence and the last absence of Scottish beer, Robert Archibald, who was injured during the last game.
Despite all the odds of Unicaja because of the lead and triple points of Cook and Lewis' contribution, she left some hope n win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacas, thanks to the reinforcements and the centimetres in his zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Nikola Vujcic's Croatian beer, managed to balance the bassket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja used and handed over the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the pay they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit application, search engines with the largest number of sorted ads in the field of real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
Tool How much should you take? Calculates user payments based on more than 140.000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you need to put your profession, years of experience, age and city where you want to work.
During the week that the application works, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels ill-remunerated", explained in his report Albert Rivera, responsible for Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in Great Britain and France, Spain is the worst paying.
The British programmer takes EUR 45,226 gross annually and French 31.059, while Spain receives EUR 24,000.
Similarly, the driver pays EUR 34,247 per year in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, Spain has the worst paid job of a waiter with € 11,592 net per year; followed by a seller with € 14,725 and a worker with € 15,667.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, half-time jobs and a social worker.
Brazil fixed the date of Zelaya’s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate will officially end.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital city of Honduras, confirmed for TV Globe that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy until this date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that, on January 27th, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek other refuges."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the election of 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he remained in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to obtain refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally collapsed, because Zelaya refused a condition of political asylum that he was trying to impose on him the "de facto" government, which is chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented a prevailing mood on markets, uncertainty again emerged in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where the players make decisions about the future, which is uncertain of themselves.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilise the market was the fixing of debt by direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at the nearest zero rate in order to enable financial institutions to buy assets to be deducted.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended, and without questioning their incompatible liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the neighbourhood, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterotoxic measures, and we are participating in a return to reducing the risk of returns.
The momentum of the storm and the differences in community bonds have regained points, although they are still very remote from the abnormal level that they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to socialise a private risk, which once again affected public debt.
Once again, the US, Japan and Germany have become a refuge for elected investors, expanding the differentiation of the euro area countries towards Germany.
This instability was almost not affected by Spain, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the UK's qualification.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty is not useful for the silence of moral risk advocates who have tried again to burden the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy for stifling the destructive consequences of restricting the credit to employment when, in fact, it would be necessary to declare a new Thanksgiving day.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal battle between the emirs on the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers deficits, elections and the new government is coming.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from the default of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro's member countries not to fulfil their obligations.
But what is logical is that Ecofin should force the Greek government to be transparent and commit its own citizens to shared responsibility in the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are in front of a period of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses on supported positions would be within the framework of expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences decrease and our differences continue to widen, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is just anecdotes. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to predate their scenarios of renewal and revise their 2011 upcoming scenario, including OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not give the Spanish economy much hope of fulfilling this warning.
Again, it looks like it's gonna be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for now, "be careful, driver friend".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Chamber of Members to discuss the Spanish Energy Strategy in the next two decades.
Following his intervention followed by President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasecy, Galán provided several comments on the motion he submitted to the subcommission behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another 60,000 million from this date to 2030 if nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If that were not the case, the necessary investment would not be up to 60,000 million.
Iberdrala does indeed believe that investment should be directed in the coming decade not to increase production capacity, but to distribution networks and international connections
Since 2020, the issue has changed and there will be a need to increase performance.
Its supply focuses on gas plants and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and especially renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energy".
Galan, who believes that the proposal for a sustainable economy law, which has just been approved by the government, corresponds to the line that the company requested, did not want to run a vein as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which opposes the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "accurate" measures, as President Iberdrol called them.
However, Galán believes that the investment decision, although long-term, must be taken now, because their maturity takes place and a stable tax framework is necessary for their initiation.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
A subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport ground services, Swiss Swissport, will play the role of Aer Lingus, a preferential associate of Irish airlines, for freight services at 10 European airports, where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet expired on economic terms, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to establish an Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The association anticipates an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is on Ferrovial.
Energy efficiency research at motorways and airports will be one of the tasks of the Centre.
Acciona seeks his first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for her first highway concession in Australia, which is a market where she already works as an energy and water company.
The construction involved is an estimated $1,700 million (about €1,047 million) tunnel.
Her rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
A tunnel 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the nearest option for the Acciona to settle in this country as a construction and concession highway.
City Hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
Following the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initiative in English) for further development of the project in the business plan protected by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the toll.
Offers are expected to be submitted in May, and the expected investment will reach $1,700 million (€1,047 million) and three companies with significant presence in European buildings at the final stage of the competition.
The Transcity Group is headed by Accion, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and G Hella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second is based in Italy is one of the largest European specialists for underground construction.
Against the Acciona group is the Northern Direct Group with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French Bouygues Construction Group.
The third and last companies, which passed through the network, have the name LBRJV and share the Australian capital of Leighton (the daughter of the construction company Hochtief, the represented ACS), also the local Baulderstone (the ownership of the Bilfinger Berger Group) and a major company specialising in civil construction of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatisations, but it brings with it the clear difficulty of entry in a different way than the intermediate acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to the Asian references.
ACS gained a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtif, owner of Leighton, quoted.
Million assets
Acciona is betting on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities of the energy supplier and in the shipping trade.
In addition to other assets, there is the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, leading a group of enterprises that build and manage the sedimentation facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and to use common energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground road subject to the toll, promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructures Office, called Northern Link (Northern Link), is intended to connect the western highway from Toowong to the Kelvin Grove circular route (see map) within 5 kilometres of the tunnel. It is the largest event to reduce the traffic congestion of Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to be set for the summer 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid crossing would open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (€308 million) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit as it announced yesterday a contract with a government estimated at 154 million.
The ACS will operate through its local Leighton office infrastructure of the national broadband network with fibre cable.
This situation will allow a rapid internet access of 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the construction project of the King George Tower on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work should have just started and Hochtief closed the sale of 129 million.
In Great Britain, specifically in Manchester, will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC has been assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its Alpina subsidiary, FCC obtained an allocation of 2.1 km of tunnel construction for a highway in Slovenia worth €64.5 million.
The company received a contract a few days after working to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens his experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Oh, shit, Rushmore got an ad at Renfe.
Renfe assigned advertising and marketing services to Sra's agency in the last two years. Rushmore for an estimated amount of three million euros per year, informed the company operating the railway.
The contract includes a 12-month extension every year. Sr. Rushmore was chosen among the 16 agencies that presented themselves in the Renfe contest, four of which joined the final four, among them TBWA , which has been responsible for creating advertising in the last three years.
Rushmore will take care of the campaign design and production.
Penalty 63 million for France Télécom to stop competition
The French competition regulatory authority fined EUR 63 million lFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions that belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition for fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes with consumers at the edge of the regulation.
This sanction, the former French monopoly, and still a state company, has bought more than €560 million in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles on the part of its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the Authority, which is watching over competition, believes that France Télécom has committed a similar crime as in the past, and has thus taken place on a reciprocal basis.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened a trade with Internet applications in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, Orange will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries as Spain.
The Champions League has brought 476.4 million Madrid and Barça from the beginning
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The Charter is run by Manchester United.
The Charter is run by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided EUR 5.362.5 million among 105 cooperatives (of which 12 Spanish) who participated since the tournament took place in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money he got to participate, and the only one with AC Milan who won the three main prizes.
The Catalan present champion and the last winner of the late European Cup in 1992 is in the fifth classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two cooperatives that also charged the most money to participate in the last League of Champions.
And yet she's lost both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to receive the most money through the Champions, although it has received the most titles from all (against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by the complex process in the distribution of money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the authority chaired by Michel Platini is planning to make a profit of 1,090 million for the League Champions.
Of this money, UEFA devotes 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the preliminary classification round (other than Atlética Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved the participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to the additional EUR 550,000 for each match they take.
There are also prizes for winning (EUR 800,000) and for a draw (EUR 400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarterfinalists3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion earns 9 million, while the second finalist makes 5.2 million.
Thus, on fixed payments, the club earns at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31,2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are moving payments on which 337.8 million are intended.
This money shall be divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four seats.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the money allocated, second 30%, third 20% and fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid by the number of matches to take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group released yesterday details of the purchase offer of shares, using which it wants to gain a top place between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not commit to making a public offer for the acquisition (opcee) of all securities.
More specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which would be paid in ten years and for which interest would be paid for this delay1% per year.
Yesterday the Sos shares ended trading on EUR 1,85; therefore Nueva Rumasa's offer is valued by the company by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer shall be conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The group of Jerez provides a deadline of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the stock.
The CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateo confirmed that it had joined the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million while the capitalization of Sos is 254,27 million.
In the meantime, sauce continues to change the structure of its management.
The election of María Luisa Jorda as head of internal audit has been announced as an attempt to stay on the edge of possible offers for purchase and settlement of the judicial developments of his former leaders, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazars.
This decision makes it the first woman to occupy a high position in a food business.
It is a newly created place that will be subject directly to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy as the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos by the Salazar brothers' company.
In fact, the possibility that Sos will discover new fund movements in the coming months cannot be reduced
Concerning the Salazar credit, former members of the Ildefontso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) told the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing where they were being assigned.
CNMV allows the option to exclude Paternin, which was involved by Inversion Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) granted the exemption, which is part of Inversion Mer, to the Federation of Paternin on 9 October.
The supervisory authority explained that it would permit this operation, since it understood that its conditions were in conformity with the applicable standards and believed that the "adequate" content explaining the brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December was submitted.
The CNMV specified that the offer is directed at obtaining 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbau.
In addition, he explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been reduced, which could not be transferred in any way until an offer which it had specified had been determined by the Federal Paternin in accordance with the provisions in force had been closed.
New Car Appreciation Instruments
These days, storms and accidents not only make autoservices.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered a insurance event are drawn to a service where the expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of the work force can be long and complicated work.
To calculate the repair costs by hand from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labour, may take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this kind of system.
The service providers and solutions for the estimation of insurance events and maintenance shall collect the information provided by the manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the US group Solera is a company leader; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of assessment tools and the development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not at all easy.
According to Eduard Velázquez, commercial director Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers work in Spain and each provides information in another format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been reported over the past five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It is a very zealous job because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle needs to be catalogued and its price determined.
In addition, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out for each model, where it is possible to "inflate" individual parts of tourist cars.
With regard to a model with massive sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As far as the mineral car is concerned, it can take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but for example not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the fleet in circulation, they exceed 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation and production of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each one specialises in particular brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) working with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million a year in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are listed and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense flow of information allows businesses to make different use and provision of various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repairs and maintenance, but, by country, there are also tools for steering spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide that informs of the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
Taking into account the products provided by Audatex, it is easy to obtain the support that professionals in the sector can use.
This company offers ten different instruments, the star product being AudaPlus, a standard award solution for insurance events for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes time for repairs estimated by the manufacturer or paint.
This tool shall be valid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it very little, up to a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company that carries out thousands of estimates will settle its price with Audatatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and equipment derived from the installation line only on the basis of the first lift number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows you to exclude vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or finding deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many model brands have passed through the service due to accident or how much has suffered serious insurance events in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company to develop such tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to works or prices and the official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Ainsa Group founded in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions for assessing damage, accidents or maintenance of cars.
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24.000 users in services, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover increased by 20% per year in the last three years and in 2008 it charged EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalisation of the installation of an office in Paris began.
Audatex was established in Germany in 1966 and was established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its brother is created in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global Solar Group invoicing (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns €19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera's group stood at a stock exchange of $1,000 million and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after the insurance event.
The operation assumed a EUR 59.5 million subscription from 85% of the company's capital, which could expand over the next year by the remaining 15%.
The objective of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to a huge international market.
This service of valuation and purchase and sale is reserved exclusively for professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, spare parts sales and professional vendors who must register before the operation starts.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 are in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
He manages 3,000 daily adverts and about 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose vehicle number has been removed cannot be returned to service but may be used as a source of spare parts which have not been damaged.
Vehicles with a historical value may have authorised operation, even though they have been decommissioned, after a preliminary procedure.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user will only get a budget in four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for a spare part, budget creation and budget generation.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of professionals of a higher age who are more or less delayed in using new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which the tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally for use a computer should be connected to the Internet.
After identification of the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a realistic graphic view of the model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables as the price of the labor force, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass it on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference directory.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is oriented to service and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this workshop tool is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, the company Audatex is working on making these views three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that the mechanics welcome because they allow for example to choose a door and turn it around to show the inner side.
