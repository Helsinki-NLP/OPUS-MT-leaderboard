Let's hope so.
He looked back at me and ran away.
Go get ready to go to bed.
It's not a weapon.
This coat is covered with skin.
I didn't know what I was giving up.
Speaking French is a big party.
Have you actually tried?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
This year, spring is late.
If you don't speak English, the chance to take a good position is much smaller.
You haven't given me as much change as you need.

Just close your eyes.
She kept the secret to herself.
Is that your pen?
He disappeared without a trace.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I think that should be expected.
This book is in easy French.
I have to go now.
His wishes finally came true.
Would you like to become a trusted user?
I'm confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They serve excellent food here.
Tom, where are you?

Stand up, please.
Who told you my name was Tom?
This is Tomovo.
I'll come, too.

I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to your place.
No one else offered to help.
Get your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What's the point?
If we just stopped trying to be happy, we'd have a good time.

You're impossible.
Tom said you were coming.
You need to be careful.

It's clear that Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they ever imagine they're capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?

I've got a tickle.
From now on, I'm going to study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was so cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I graduated American literature in college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!

I think so.
Many museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he was eating something toxic.
Don't make me do this.
You sat in my seat.
God forbid!
Green suits you.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the seashore.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you get, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the time tomorrow?
Does he have any kids?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way we can hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like to take pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom's sitting on a denier.
The girls danced in the gym.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
I finally stopped at the old house and saw the city one more time.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm snoring.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come and help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mom has a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom cuffed his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's good with everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
Here you go again anytime.
I don't want tea, I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust the least.
Would you wait outside?
Can you eat raw oysters?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train was 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compact.
The director considered firing Tom, but he decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do this.
For the most part, the students were from the West Coast.
Could it be love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, right?
Travelers across southern Germany will see farms with solar panels wherever they look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ring.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
They all jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to study French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We appreciate your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than average height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any pencils.
Natina Tom doesn't know him that well.
I'll tell you the truth now.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's lived here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is linked to national characteristics.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
Forget to feed the dog.
I need to look into this.
I'll watch you.
I used to want to be an astrophysicist.
Tom threw up blood.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to cut it a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you happy to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you and my little sister leave at the same time?
The game was postponed for some time.
His brother's been studying a lot.
Ken has arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit the museum?
The robbers robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put her coat on.
That cable book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's mean.
What is the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I deal with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father rarely smokes.
His vain attempts to seduce her showed him that he had the wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I'm meeting him at noon.
The invitation said there would be popcorn and non-alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's way older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike ran very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a man you need to meet.
I was rude.
The Lumpur Tower is worth a visit.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
You speak French too?
I just started studying French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where is the entrance ?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, no bigger than five years, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Tom has small arms.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a good trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women, homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to take Tom across the bridge.
If I were you, I'd ask for this job.
The patient was discharged from the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we'll be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
Many other tourists have arrived.
The door cracked and closed.
I'm hungry!
Talking to Tom is easy.
Twin brothers look completely like each other.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't understand the joke.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I have a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I've been studying French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
Do you want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to attend Mary's celebration.
You're not just gonna be there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm mad at myself.
It's done self-righteously by Tom.
You won't believe what people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't carry much luggage when you're traveling.
I got Tom's picture right here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They're both working.
Tom's not welcome here.
Blame her for lying to him.
There's no point in fooling yourself, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He needs to be given a head start in front of the others.
I've turned you.
Take it with you.
Just hold on a second.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He made a big deal out of me.
The crucifix burned down.
Tom was working really hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Put it down.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I never spoke to Tom in French.
We've all taken for granted that Tom can speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about the museums.
This shirt needs to be washed out.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I'm not feeling well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do whatever you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I think I'll learn to swim during my vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me freak out that easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach's not far from here.
Ken jumped over the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered with snow.
One hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right by the beach there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the image.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What is the minimum wage in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
He who sows winds will reap storms.
According to the latest census, the population of the country is slightly above 7 million people.
Temporary measures will have no effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I have nothing.
For once, think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about that.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick it up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was just stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my employees in French.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom's having a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her advice.
The room was so swollen, I couldn't breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she's a little unwell.
Is Spot gone too?
I promise I'll give it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a raincoat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together at the library?
I have a job to do.
The proposal for a job is still in effect.
Your shirt misses a button.
I have to go out for a while.
Green suits you.
Fingers crossed.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
My uncle gave me that watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working outdoors.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
This shop deals with kitchen supplies.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is cute.
Please, give me another cup of coffee.
Alice might come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay till the day after tomorrow.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does anyone on your team speak French?
Looks like it's gonna be snowing.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been up at Fuji's.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What is the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has sparked heated debates.
Eat a live frog every morning and nothing worse will happen to you during the rest of the day.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
Last night I couldn't blink.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you need to freshen up your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We teach French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please have patience.
Your joke's too far away.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a teacher in French.
I'm glad I don't need this.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom still wanted to be single.
I have three kids.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
My uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
I had pizza every day last week.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
You're obviously wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened a check account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took his coat off.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a weird problem.
I don't understand that.
What kind of place do you live in?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got a six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you around.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes are good for you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take a bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found Mary was missing.
Your neck's a shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In the esperane, the essentials end with an "o." A multiple number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Won't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student in my class.
I buy tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and visit us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
Triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is Romania's minimum wage?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you going to get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard that French is a difficult language.
I didn't eat all the food.
Soon you'll stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball at the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol's back at his hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered in snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
There's no mention of Tom yet.
Pass it on to me.
Did you make it through everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect to the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
Tom is much easier to speak in English than in French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I have chestnut hairs.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
There's only a few left.
I like that color.
My grandmother was in surgery in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return your favor.
Tom dug up the drawer to see if there's a pen he can use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more precise.
Tom's French is really pretty good.
Isn't time great?
I'm not comfortable with that.
I don't want to belong to an elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You need to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm a vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process has achieved good results.
That's what his ignorance is all about.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French isn't good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you take out six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll have a farewell party for him.
Which club do you belong to?
Atsushi may have been ill.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your seat.
He graduated Cambridge with honors.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Is Tom studying French at school?
What shoes are they?
We certainly worked hard.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it warms up.
He's starting to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay here until tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
This is the photo I took on Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'm gonna help you get better at this.
My dad went running every morning.
I saw Tom walking on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractive.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
It's okay to create a website, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She has a wonderful handwriting.
The fingers of the hand are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, nameless and puppy.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've solved the task with ease.
Did anybody notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much does a cab come out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is this yours, Tom?
I don't have a lot of English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiased began his respectable endeavor.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, his local cowboys laughed at him.
He seems to be in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more specific.
I'm on leave this week.
She's washing her socks.
I promise I won't do that again.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't know French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I don't doubt his sincerity.
Please open the package.
I'm buying.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you please tell me your name?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Does he see the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time for them to leave.
She makes makeup every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make my sweet eyes.
I don't have any money.
Honey eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do that without you.
Tom's not used to living in town.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long fields are now a demo.
He's doing really well with kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
It finally stopped raining and time warmed up.
She was doing not particularly light hints of what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in that book.
I study French every day.
I heard every word.
Where did you take your socks off?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used properly are useful.
What are we going to eat?
Keep it a secret.
You're making me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you pass me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary a few effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to succeed.
I found out he was a chemistry genius.
You can't go this way, you can't start blaspheming at people's addresses.
I had a date at 2:30, but I got stuck in traffic and couldn't make it in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom is making a lot of efforts to improve his French.
You've been lost in vain for a long time.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you a fool.
I'm speaking French today.
Will you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it inside.
We're all connected.
A word of support, when you fail, costs more than an hour of praise when you have succeeded.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was over.
His shirt was washed with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story to be interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Anne a doll.
What have you done, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
It was cleaned up.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing is certain, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told recently that he had cancer.
Tom came home on a bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What have you got to do?
Tom was studying French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
Here's the hospital where I was born.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's share the reward of fifty-fifty.
Squeeze my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom had a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom is the man who told me when the meeting would be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers began to return home.
I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy seems so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
She's grown up.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to watch the movie.
Whoever's well prepared, no worries.
I had fun watching TV last night.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on whose leaves the silkworms live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I've got news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
The joints hurt.
I've tried everything I know.
Why are people afraid of her?
He's been struggling with hepatitis for six months, but it looks like he's just started recovering.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
What's the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you give me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they bend to their diseases.
I wouldn't think tofuto's so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
Now what time is it?
Then what does it mean?
I haven't had my vertigo yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned to swim.
You really can't swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm sick of wreaths.
I can't do this alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about this, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends and finally everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom's speaking with a French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the lunar park.
I thought it best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you see it carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
That's the sweetest puppy I've ever seen.
I'm not malicious.
In this restaurant, the food's good.
I don't do that.
Are they confused?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
Unemployment creates it.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Sugar's sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a great poem.
The prices have fallen recently.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me off?
If you're late for the control show, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to carry Tom across the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be mad at me about that.
I grabbed the cat for the door.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There were lots of frogs in this pond.
I understand it perfectly.
Depends on the context.
Did something change?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read French, right?
Fred's often late for class.
Don't cry, you won't fix anything.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love parties.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him coming down the stairs.
A friend is coming to visit tomorrow.
I hope that's what's gonna happen.
Maybe Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us downtown.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You drive too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
What's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'll like it!
I'm afraid I hurt you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's been deprived of his experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom wasn't paying any attention to Mary.
Put on your slippers, please.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's got blond hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
In the next semester, I'm going to study French.
Tom's not giving a speech today.
I'll see you tonight.
I'm out of money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing ever happens the way you thought it would.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children should obey their parents.
Are there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come Sunday night?
I remember we've met before.
I see him as my best friend.
No one answered the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're studying the Esperant.
The new bike costs me 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Save it for later.
They're best friends.
You're the problem.
You're so shallow.
I have great news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel went down because of the earthquake the other day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke slowly Japanese.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Close the damn door!
We made fun of him for that.
John came in a week ago.
He turned down the offer.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The barber is a man who shaves his beard and cuts the hairs of men.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here somewhere.
Tom liked to sing, but no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't lie down on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not misplaced.
I'm a regular office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen the kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I'm not coming in time.
He often walks to school.
The stockings stink.
When are you getting married?
It's a pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're cruel.
How many episodes of Wan Pace have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is there a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're sweet and sweet.
My sister lives next to Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
That was not my intention.
I've got to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, I'm asking you to spray a little insecticide behind the fridge.
She told me I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your luggage.
Soon after, it started raining.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permits.
Tom sent Mary a message in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says friendly goodbye and wishes me a pleasant evening.
Let's check it out.
You've done a good job so far.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't stand up.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was volume?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him herself.
I got a job for Tom.
Where'd you throw them?
As usual, the physics teacher is late for class.
Let's find out what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You're sitting in my seat.
I've tried this way before.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this bathroom.
You've entered a winning series.
I want a drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for anything but to take care of the baby.
Nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be disturbed.
I don't think Tom's number is in the index finger.
Can you do it yourself?
Thank you very much for your detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
She's the one who's stuck with her after dinner.
These containers are being sealed in hermetically.
He's the best player on our team.
I've seen you before.
There's none.
I want more details.
Are you carrying a gun?
He says he avoided danger by pretending to be dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Be careful with her.
Don't shoot, I'm coming out.
Isn't that surprising?
He's making friends with everyone he meets.
You need to study harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't get it.
He broke into a house.
I arrived later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was trembling.
I was your mother's first friend.
Controversy has ruined our unity.
How much do I have to take with me?
Tom's good with French.
I'm into stories like this.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just shopping.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Whose socks?" "To my sister."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a tall, slender blonde.
I gave Mary a book.
His reprimand told him not to eat between the main feeding hours.
Is there any survivors?
The shelf is sticking on her feet.
We chose Jack as president.
This is my friend Tom.
They've been tearing each other apart.
Tom is a French teacher.
We're going down to the next station.
Tom asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's got bright skin.
Thank you, that's all.
The engine doesn't want to start.
I'm early.
Let's go undercover.
Jesse immediately accepted the invitation.
Jack Nicholson grew up in New Jersey.
Is there free will?
I'll be there.
I think it's Tom's motorcycle.
I have to go see Tom.
It's been a long time since the last one such a nice surprise for me.
Let's play Canadian.
I think we've got plenty of time.
Junko's a nice girl.
Let's have lunch.
I've been waiting so long.
Aren't they sweet?
I can't change those plans.
I'll be home soon.
He was on his way to work.
I had a little fever this morning.
The medicine works.
I can't go anymore.
Tom has a very big nose.
Is this the right direction for the museum?
School starts at eight and a half.
It happened twice.
Deep breathing is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We've gone crazy worrying about you.
He can't read.
You're doing just fine.
Disputes won't solve anything.
Maybe I'm wrong.
I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and memory of the newly learned words.
I think they know us.
I have no intention of hurting you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you asleep?
Our team was wearing red shirts.
How about a beach walk?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say cheese.
Tom won't get paid.
The rain stopped me from coming out.
When I was your age, we had to walk up the slope to school in both directions.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Nothing more, thank you.
I've already tried.
I think you're working too hard.
He drank a lot last night.
That won't help you.
Just do as Tom says.
The prisoners were released.
Be careful with that.
I don't see anything.
The meeting was adjourned.
You don't have to be a pain in the ass.
It was a great day.
How old was he?
That's off!
Tom can't see you.
I wrote to my teacher in French.
Aren't you coming?
I'll stay till lunch.
I forgot his name.
I think you'll be pleased.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Then where's the problem?
It wasn't that heavy.
It's business.
Please lock the safe.
She interrupted me.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to study French.
Tom gave Mary his card.
I think you'd better stay with Tom.
He didn't do it, Tom.
That's the job I chose.
I think we're out of gas.
Let me tell you something about myself.
We pushed the car.
What is the minimum wage in Germany?
We got something for you.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I don't eat pork.
It was a mistake coming here.
The paper published a profile of its new editor.
The beginning was a failure from the very beginning.
Why don't we get him a bottle of wine?
Five days after she finished, my daughter flew from Osaka Airport to Germany.
The boy laughed at the girl.
Please don't touch.
I've seen Tom around here.
I have to get in touch with Tom.
I haven't bathed in three days.
Just close your eyes.
Let's make friends.
I've just created a new text-processing program with which words can be spoken inversely.
We certainly need Tom's help.
Please give me a pillow and blanket.
Your tie and jacket don't go away.
I wish I was as young as you.
I was amazed at how well Tom spoke French.
Tom lives a little down the same street as Mary lives on.
The new teacher is in the classroom.
Hurry up or you'll miss the bus.
I thought I told you never to go there alone.
I think you'll be impressed.

Pick the one you like.

You'll be sorry.
No one in her school is a better swimmer than her.
Is there a big house?
He drinks too much beer.
She's very shy and worried when she's somewhere at a party.
I think Tom's a good name.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
I heard what happened.
I like your shirt.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom might object.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think you'd better give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to provide a good education for their children.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's thirsty.
You're going to London next Sunday, right?
I have plans for tonight.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You don't seem too surprised.
Obviously, it worked.
I have to teach Tom that.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumped out the window.
I'm telling you, it's my fault.
Let me call you back.
I gave them clothes and some food.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
I'll be up early tomorrow.
You like French, don't you?
She almost got run over by a car.
Tom's not like them.
I left my credit card at home.
It's too hot.
You're bleeding.
I just want to be with you.
I want to study French.
She eats apples.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the party.
Are you happy?
Why don't you get an umbrella just in case?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Are you done with breakfast yet?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it again.
He arrived earlier than usual.
I talked to him about it on the phone.
I think you're very talented.
The voyages were almost empty.
We need more research.
This is your responsibility.
Come and visit us.
I have to push my bike because one of the tires is down.
This shirt is standard size.
Don't make fun of me.
I put my hand on her shoulder.
From the store to the house, I carried the heavy luggage and I got used to ho-o-op-hop.
What languages are spoken in America?
That's amazing.
Listening to the news, she passed out.
Don't be disappointed.

In the last two months Tom has been moving from place to place all the time.
I think you should go out.
He comes here twice a week.
This primary school has a strong football team.
How could Tom not like you?
Hitomi seemed very happy.
Are you being subsidized for any magazines?
I'm afraid I'm not gonna make it for the lunch we agreed on.
That's right!
That's probably the key Tom's looking for.
I had to walk there because my car broke down.
It's still happening.

You always sing.
I left it in the garage.
I owe him 1,000 yen.
How can I find you?
Nick owes me ten bucks.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Don't punish Tom for that.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom scored three points.
Do you like to walk on the beach?
When are you leaving?
Is anyone with you?
Tom couldn't believe what was going on.
Did you have fun last night?
To say the truth, he's wrong.
They're already here.
Sitting a man in the kitchen.
I'm bringing her back.
When does the art museum close?
I was busy this week.
You come from Sweden.
I thought we were gonna have breakfast together.

A coffee, please.
I haven't heard from Jane since she moved to Tokyo.
It was raining like a bucket.
I think you'll be impressed.
He thanked me for coming.
He's lower than Tom.
Can you drive?
I can't speak English, not to speak Spanish.
Someone must have stolen your watch.
Tom grew up speaking French and English.
What are you doing now?
The museum deserves to be visited.
Tom's gonna be gone for a week.
I'm looking for a present for my father.
The problem isn't worth discussing.
It was pretty cold.
"For here or for home?" "For here, thank you."
Bob came home very late.
Elevators don't work.
He wants you to be brave enough to do something like that.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
I drove her to town.
Anyway, you'll never know.
Believe it or not, peaches and almonds are from one family.
Do you want to hear something funny?
There aren't enough chairs in the conference room.
I have no idea.
Tom wasn't perfect.
When I was a student at the university, I never slept the night before the exam.
I really want that.
I learned a lot of Spanish words today, and now I know how to say "busa," "breast" and "chicken".
In the winter, I sleep with two hurricanes.
Let's split it up.
I'll be around.
You can go.
I've never seen these pictures before.

She didn't like him.
He's got a strong body.
Are you scared?
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Tom can't see without his glasses.

Don't be late.
Are you involved?
I heard Tom was hurt.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I heard they caught Tom's killer.

It's time for you to leave.
Only when I think about the accident do I get sick.
I've seen them before.
Why is Tom angry?
He speaks Japanese well.
The director is thinking about getting Tom fired.
I'll be with Tom.
"How many candlesticks on your birthday?" "Fifty-six."
The polished socks are woven in the hand.

Tom's got some bad news.
Where did Tom say we should go?
Go wake up Tom.
I just finished doing my homework in French.
I'm looking for my pen.
Let's have dinner.
I'll see him tomorrow.
That guy was an asshole.
Tom likes to wear white socks with his sandals.
It's in conflict with my principles.
I don't know why Tom is so angry.
What are the facts?
I wish I could scream.
I'm the one who saved Tom.
I've seen you around.
She translated the letter from Japanese to French.
Am I fired?
Did anyone see you?
The village is far away.
What made you so angry?
How do you know that?
I forgot.
He's on the ground.
I don't know what to do next.
There's been no electricity since morning.
There's a hole in my jeans.
Tom's working overtime.
He's really good at talking.
I think you're making a mistake.
I've never heard Tom complain before.
They're probably drunk.
I'll show you where to go.
I don't have personal space.
We have something for you.
I just finished my homework in French.
Tom just made it.
I didn't expect Tom to be there.
How old are your cousins?
Your French has improved considerably.
What's in your suitcase?
We're getting married at the end of March.
He raised his hands.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Good luck to you.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He married a pretty girl.
I took care of it.
Aren't you interested?
This is something quite different.
His brothers, his sisters, or he himself will go to the station to meet his father.
I gave up Tom.
He disappeared without a trace.
You're very brave.
Speaking of travel, have you ever been to Kobe?
I have to go to the market; I'll be there in an hour.

Are you sure you don't want to come?
Can I have the bill, please?

I heard you cheering me up.
I'll lend you this book.
I don't remember that.
Where did you get the flowers?
I won't be working here for long.

In theory, it should work.

You have to leave now.
The snow was by its knees.
I feel bad today.
It's so sad to watch Tom ask for money on the street after he lost all his gambling money.
I've never seen anything like it.
You won't be the only one there.
Do you understand me?
Do you speak Turkish?
I put it in your room.
No one's home.
He still wants to come.
We have to postpone the celebration.
Tom looks great.
What could Tom be doing there?
I think that's Tom.
Just what I said could happen happened.
I was trained in this school.
Good afternoon.
I think you'll find this interesting.

Do you bring money to you?
Why didn't you tell me in advance?
I'll be back next week.
Stay with me, Tom.
The old man gave the child shelter.
I'll see you later.
I'd like to live near your house.
I think we got lucky.
I have to put an end to this.
You're so shallow.
That won't change anything.
Although the lives of people in China are now getting better and better, there is still much to be desired.
We wives have to hold on.
I'm Tom's partner.
Do you know who drew this drawing?
No one can stop me from talking to Marika.
I never realized Tom was interested in French.
I hope Tom wasn't wrong.
Is she healthy?
Let me stay.

I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole, called our Universe - a part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of his mind. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task should be to be released from this prison by extending the circle of our compassion so that all living beings and nature throughout and beauty.

I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister lately?
They're all hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, I was studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you'd better sit down.

I'll do my best.
I'll go with Tom.

I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I've got a sharp knife.
You've painted the walls, haven't you?
My mother taught me how to make flowers.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it later.

I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a private beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how it works.
You're all fools.
They're exchanging gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. Quantum's Japanese food started liking it.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You need to focus on that fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom taught me to speak French.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to get my bill.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to fix it.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary is Tom's older sister.
I don't know any of the other boys.
The guests should start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.

This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary off the edge of the cliff.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruit the rot under the sun.
He's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes at the control room.
Time is on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It might take a while.
I thought you might step away.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Look out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
Now I remember, you don't have to smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
He's only four minutes away from here by train.
What's Tom trying to do?
Can anyone believe you?
It's a little smooth.
I think we'd better get going.
Tom said it's probably not gonna take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I studied French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We're staying in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's two parents were both teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's cloudy today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after he was ten months away.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were intrigued by Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom is twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two girlfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have a wreath infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need this anymore.
Put it back where you got it from.
Let's get started.
I screwed you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing money from the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
You think I'm that stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see it again, it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What is the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision on this today.
She didn't have much money.
You've been sitting in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you study French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we're going to college.
What are you eating, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There are a lot of sentences for DNA, but there's not one for RNA.
One of my parents needs to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind blew up.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter's married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of the 20 students, only one reads the book.
I've got work to do on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authorities.
I came home on a train.
I think I can do it in my free time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What situation would you have done?
What was the name of the guy you used to date before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, I find it awkward.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to dogs and had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
Back then, there was no television or radio.
She went to the taxi museum.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes in their heel.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She feels her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric light.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he shouldn't have.
It'll be good if you don't get involved in personal affairs.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My wreaths bleed every time I use a thread for teeth.
We arrived quickly because the movement was not loaded.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He just got back from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in touch with him in a long time.
Those glasses go to you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until you get it over with.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't be helping us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
This pair of shoes doesn't suit me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when does Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand Uygurian sentences in Daddy!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the gathering.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's crash here.
I know this is hard.
Are you a exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
You think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If humanity does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thanks, I'm just looking.
I felt rejected by these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't pick him up yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his greatest flaw.
Press Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know that.
I wonder what Tom meant.
Nothing's costing.
I don't mind hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new business cards.
I'm thirsty.
Flowers go up without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him, and in the meantime, write this letter.
This chicken hasn't eaten an egg in a while.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school goes well.
Mrs. Jung didn't mind me visiting her unexpectedly.
You have nice lips.
A lot of people are gonna lose their jobs because of the car industry's downturn.
He came for my help.
We're going to start the downfall in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's coming to an end.
The moment of fame for Hanshin did not last long. They were quickly moved from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Won't that lead to problems?
He resented being called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
You really want this?
Will he fail at the exam?
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions did they reach?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I think I'm lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I gotta move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pie on the side of the kitchen window to get cold.
Happy is the man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Oh, how pathetic!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Is it good?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth's globe into two hemispheres.
It was personal.
Doesn't he interest you?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good to get some rest.
When did you start learning French?
She used to do her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where'd you throw them?
Tom, how is he going to deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't spoken to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
That's Tom's camera, isn't it?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for being late.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Go through that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
This isn't much fun.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My father drives very well.
We have to protect our children.
Until new meetings.
I'm exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you cheering them up.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I'm going to France.
Please stir the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Budstrasse and get off to Zeitstrasse.
Laughter is good for your health!
It's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom that everyone told me about.
Add this site to "Received".
When the sun of culture is low, even the dwarfs throw a big shadow.
When's the museum open?
I've seen you around.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I won't give in to the threats.
You're better than me.
Do you have any nails?
I hope it's helpful.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's up late.
Tom's fine.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I get your knife?
You have to file the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me that earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we're going anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret it.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even get the water to boil, let alone bake a turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Is she free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
During the winter, the highways were covered with ice.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm a grown-up now.
I want to go.
Give it back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want some orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French like a Frenchman.
I think we need to make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're gonna need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I gonna die?
I got a little snug while dancing, and I got on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have, how many sisters do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this around in pubs.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking down the uneven road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind is you.
She took the test.
I'll study at the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I've made some mistakes on the exam.
This book isn't owned by Tom.
Where have you been?
I've got to get it out of here.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work at the hospital.
Tom's a grown man.
Let's not fool around.
I got better.
It's not art, it's a vagina with teeth.
I never saw you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so receptive.
Have you heard of him?
She washed her shirt in a hurry.
Is anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather loves to read.
Did you know you're wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had one single wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night, and with Alice Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
It's a letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time.
Men get in shape, riding a bike.
This isn't the end of the story yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Is there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More tests are needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there such an expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just shake your thumbs.
I went to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep country.
I'm sorry.
I don't waste any ammo.
You're my best friend.
I set up a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French poems?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move with you.
She got up on twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What does that mean?
They come from Sweden.
Be careful when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What is your nationality?
That part's good.
Merry Christmas!
Come on down.
Mary ran.
They yearn for city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came in with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary talking about it.
Let's eat sushi.
Drop those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was overwhelmed by a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say that kind of thing.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom's on his way to first class.
Don't stay out late.
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this problem?
I think you've had enough.
You've told me this before.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Would you help me translate this?
Tom hardly understands anything in French.
This is the same hospital Tom works for.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner spends a lot of electricity.
Don't get involved with this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be abolished.
First the good God made the man, and then made the woman, and then he had mercy on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or somewhere.
Does that look familiar to you?
Get your coat.
What kind of money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost done.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi's dancing.
Today machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from flat feet.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Man's stupidity is endless," I say, and because of my self-criticism, I'm considered an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter into French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom thought Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole road's heading up the hill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were the same.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth out last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't cover how you feel about that.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It will be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom gets sick a lot.
The key doesn't fit in the lock.
What is the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom turned on the light again.
That bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating hot.
Pick what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
It's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were gonna have breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
She put on her sweater.
Sometimes my money ends.
Don't worry, Mr. President, with such bad gums, she hardly even has IMA teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try the dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a cliff.
Where were you born?
Those clothes are good for you.
They're headed straight for their goal.
The boy came through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you finished with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
The permanence pays off.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't make it.
Get ready for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being watched by alien intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad's walking around in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each one of them a pencil.
Don't bother me, I think.
I think you should let go of your beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another non-alcoholic?
A lot of people share my view on this.
The shirt's clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his great endeavor at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court to be filled, but a fire to be lit.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Sorts the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I can.
I'll hide in here.
She was taking care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was walking.
I saw the girl between the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English and not speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He graduated Yale with honors in 1921.
I think I have a way of saving you for a while.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
Milk makes cheese and milk.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I haven't really thought about it.
I'm on vacation this week.
If a sick woman bends a thousand paper cranes, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised that building still stands.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hacone.
Look at these papers.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom started the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Make 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad time has prevented us from leaving.
Now I'm studying French.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm awfully busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You've entered a winning series.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The distribution of television has greatly deprived us of our time to read.
I'm gonna need an eternity to explain everything.
Don't get in my closet.
The new coronavirus is very contagious.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm off the record here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here by 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a toasted cup.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He follows English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked down on me.
It's forbidden to smoke in the school buildings.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
We love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people are good at talking, and others are good listeners.
I didn't understand the last word.
As rich as she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom's on his dad's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian as well.
Japan has many distinctive features.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking with the dog tonight.
What's your blood type?
Ten houses burned down.
I shouldn't have let you do this alone.
Convicted to death.
I've only waited five minutes.
Can you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done this.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borsh" and "schie" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knees have been cut off.
I'll go back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Do you have the driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is reinvigorating.
The keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't spoken to anyone today except Tom.
I can hardly hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks a medium-sized amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're naked with your socks upside down.
We just got word from Kansas regarding your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's this all about, anyway?
Watch out for Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're in the way.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are expensive.
GNP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything in there?
Everyone was at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to do it.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as much a disease as a snore.
Aren't you afraid, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV, too.
Let's go to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He sometimes watches TV.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only 30 minutes left until the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
It was a mistake coming here.
Don't push us so hard.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be okay.
Tom won't know anything about that.
Don't forget to bring kitchen supplies like knives and cooking dishes.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised I'd never do it again.
Jane runs to school sometimes.
I think you'll like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen a koala?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you're panicking.
He went out for a walk.
I hope you're right.
Not less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My vacation plans have failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think that's true.
I lost track of time.
He thought this might be a trick.
He's exactly the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'm going to visit my grandmother in the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and no one loves anyone.
Tom put his knee on.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report this.
You're pretty good with French, aren't you?
He postponed the celebration.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They caught five butterflies.
Do it for me.
"How you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Put the car in the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do?
I saw his father fighting him.
Keep your room clean and covered.
I had a rough night.
She didn't like her husband.
I've been studying his face for signs of exhaustion.
Music is the common language of humanity.
Give me some sugar.
I'll take you home.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
I'd love to sing for you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom is very interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
It's Copacabana!
Maybe it's true, but I can't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Watch me do it.
We're going to the movies.
He often goes to the movies with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was terminated.
I'll be right next to you if you go do it.
What's the name of the hotel in Boston that he was staying in last year?
It's a complicated problem.
Now it's 10:00.
It's raining like a bucket.
Are you single, too?
He's known as a great poet.
We won't be here in 2:30.
I saw Jesse standing there.
I was buying books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I like sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't get Tom to find out.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle, please.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest advances in medicine are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I have no interest in doing this.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it down as lost.
I've been waiting three days.
Material riches often go hand in hand with the rejection of society.
Did you count the towels?
You need to get a real job.
You two have nothing in common.
A lot of scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't have.
You're a good singer.
The cat eats.
I'm used to my parents not paying attention to me.
Speaking of travel, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.
Nancy looks like my sister.
Tom doesn't like math.
He taught his children well.
I was just being nice.
Tom's growing tomatoes in his garden.
I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She seems the young man shy.
It's made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I'm really sleepy.
Be more specific.
I was on leave.
No one will know.
Tom goes out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put his seat belt on.
You think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy put all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied it to the chair.
I'm young.
It's a big city.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Are you in debt yet?
Can you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom's still tough.
The problem seems a lot more complicated.
I drink water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been good lately.
I have to tell you something first.
A coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have a choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the family first, and then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy palely reminded his father of appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop for me.
How do you tell them apart?
Time is on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They improved their results.
Don't push them so hard.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has a drinking problem?
Is there anyone at the station meeting me?
I haven't heard from him in months.
I don't play both.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
I kind of understand that question.
Why aren't you here?
Tom is the guy who gave me this bike.
We're not going to fire under the pressure of a tyrant.
Tom's a complete mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom is so angry.
It's so good to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you weigh that?
What's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
I didn't say that either.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here on your own?
Do you have subordinates who speak French?
I can't speak French much.
Ask him about the way to the station.
He was going fishing during the day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I'm out.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works at the wine shop.
Tom had nothing to do with it.
Who's listening, Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want to pay attention to them.
I'm curious.
Please wake me at six in the morning.
She makes me feel awkward.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
The Staffides are dried grape grains.
I've been to India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of opportunities.
We were driving when we changed.
If you want anything, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He plays baseball after school.
The sound of a terrible scream made him tremble.
Do you have that shirt in black?
It wasn't a party.
Well, you ordered a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg talks too much.
I took things off.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no room for concern.
We have a physical.
Are you having fun last night?
This sweater is worth over $50.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their name.
This is for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in the service.
I have an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Squeeze your shirts before they get mashed up.
I'll be there.
Don't get too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
The investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away, you'll need them later.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
That book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I took Highway 58.
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Unbutton your shirt, please.
I almost forgot.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a serious fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I have nothing.
If you need any help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign stamps.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We're on a cruise to Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You've been drinking since my class.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's the work going?
I wrote a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
It's a comfort phone.
Do you sell French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom went there to study French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I couldn't handle the lights.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom is very modest.
Thank you for that.
But a ball, a Turkish panic, oh, my God, Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school that Tom intends to attend.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We have very large lotus leaves.
We are firmly convinced that when making sentences, the author should avoid succumbing to harmful habits inherent in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are actually absolutely unnecessary in the light of a purposeful sense.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move," make your way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When does it end?
He comes in every time he sees blood.
Don't!
I thought we were gonna make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He couldn't pass the test.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep while I was reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I didn't steal anything.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom's gonna stay.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found 2 kilos of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that close to your house?
Jane filled out a statement.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
The fools run where the angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been in sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you allow me to come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've waited so long for it to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say things like that when there's kids around.
He's getting cold.
I want to improve my French speech.
You're not gonna believe what I heard.
I'll teach Tom.
Today, the train is ten minutes late.
There's been a silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go on a date.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting prettier.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer doesn't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to do a background check on the date of the exam.
Maybe he's avoiding the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll listen to your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan virtually every family has a washing machine.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The raven flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly do you do, what's the scope of your research, your main interest?
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hello to Tom.
I think Tom's drunk.
I've had a lot of head.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist who doesn't believe.
There's a little chance I won't make it to the meeting.
He always greeted me with a gift.
How should I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read pretty well.
Tom's okay, right?
She stared for a while in the paper.
J.F. Kennedy was buried in Arlington Cemetery.
I'm not giving up.
What do you care?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar in the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I don't take any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He'll make it to the Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been very violent lately. My favorite football team is falling down.
It was easy for me to relate to the sweet talk.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language carrier.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there while it's still light.
Tom hurt himself.
His room is a mess.
They take part in their free time to care for the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom intends to go.
Ask Tom.
Turn on the radio.
I'll stay for three more days.
We delayed leaving for tomorrow.
Nature knows no bounds.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to find out what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have to come.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laughing.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't go into the museum.
He insisted, even though I told him not to do it.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming really fast.
Add this site to Preferreds.
I have a lot to say about this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's up to you.
The worst part is, it wasn't always like that.
All the efforts of the doctor were in vain and the man soon died.
I noticed you weren't at your house last night.
Threatening us.
You want to buy this skirt.
He's an excellent brain surgeon.
I got cold last month.
He can speak French as well.
Are you going?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They updated the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been living in French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
Either he or I'm wrong.
You learn French, don't you?
The girl's used to playing alone.
I play in a group.
The birds are singing.
Tom finishes work at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
The time will come when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they get on a bus to the museum?
Is he your teacher?
Be careful with him.
Be precise.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a golden rule: whoever has the gold, he sets the rules.
The house is haunted by ghosts.
Tom's going into town.
Everything that's not forever has grown old forever.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You always disagree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I care.
Have you heard Tom speak French?
It's a beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty well.
Say hello to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should pick Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not get basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give some of the work to the junior employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you do, you can't make a man believe in something, even less of yourself.
I don't feel very well.
The air conditioning's not working.
You're sitting in my seat.
Does something scare you?
They all agree with you.
Tom encouraged me to study French.
I want a MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm shivering when I think about it.
I paid $200 in taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is that?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving up this watch for a while, and let's not talk about breaking up with him definitively.
He didn't get the job.
I think you're gonna do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made an egg sandwich.
What did you see?
I take a bath every morning in the summer.
Lock your shirts.
Read it again.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't make it in time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruits to oranges.
This place deserves to be visited at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister smoothed her shirt.
I've told you this before, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't want you gold or silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like some orange juice.
From the moment I picked up your book, until I left it, I was laughing all the time, and one day I was going to start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's tied up for the round.
That's what I've seen.
Delphine is a species of mammal.
What color are these?
He shook his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it could be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I don't take drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother 19 flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She decorated the room with beautiful furniture.
The pocket calculators can be bought at the price of a pair of socks, and thousands of British children are needed in school, no less than pencils and rubber.
This is the hospital Tom was born in.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just go out there and speak evil against people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'm borrowing money.
She's cooking for college.
I think you're really amazing.
It looks like all Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.
For the cold time, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's running around like a chicken without a head.
Greece is an ancient country.
Several people attended the meeting.
He put on his coat and came out of the house.
Dadeba's new site will launch a home-based hyper database, "built from the basics" search engine, and will go on a dadebux-OS server with a dadephone CPU, made entirely of Daddybius.
Her old man got in the way.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it very much.
I've never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice present.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
During my vacation, I read all Milton's work.
What would you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Take your time protecting me.
Who is the capital of Greece?
Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as little.
Tom's not used to city life.
You kept your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting too much sugar on.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
The man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden cheered up.
They made us work all day.
We chose him to be president.
No kidding?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I would have told you.
What is the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between a piano and a violin, which would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the test?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far, so good.
This species is endangered.
I think it's better if you go to bed.
I like you a lot.
I called the bell.
The wolves are moving on packs.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch it, Tom!
The museum is closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't back down.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're getting into this the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have a small chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved tangiblely compared to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
We finally met. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little more specifically?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we need to look into this.
So we're all in agreement.
If time permits, I'll go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you're gonna be a great dad.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Would you show me that bag?
That's my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You're not gonna believe me.
Can you come in at nine?
Let's sync our watches.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a duty-free store?
I'm looking for a present for my friend.
And if I had told you, kele fida.
That's the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Make sure you don't get lost.
I'm sick of changing my plans every time you think you want something else.
From a distance, it looks like a man.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I have to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter who told her what.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not rush.
My dad went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to jump to conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is the milk of the adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I dream nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we get a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
I'm sorry!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy deeply asleep.
She called it what she wasn't.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I had to open my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were intrigued by the cold.
It's open for dogs.
Kids are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated Tom.
Go ahead.
It's a challenge for me, and I learn a lot.
Tom was pissed off.
I was counting on her.
Don't look, Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish you caught Tom.
All right, let's go.
Here comes the car.
Looks like we'll be able to make it in time.
Being a troll is art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodyguard.
The man eats bread.
He's crossing the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my greetings to your family.
When someone in the middle sent a message into a bottle, it's just a childish fantasy. When Christopher Columbus sent a message into a bottle, the fate of an entire country is placed on a map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
Kids play dojball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean your room.
I tried to be human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Does Tom really want me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums have you visited?
I waited as long as I could.
He broke into the room without taking off his coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th, and Muriel's birthday is on.
The way he works does not show him anything to boast about.
We don't see things as they are, but as we are.
She slightly pushed the door.
Come when you're comfortable.
Alexander wrote a few sentences in Berber.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
That's when I first visited the museum.
Is she staying at the hotel?
I don't like that jacket.
Tom and Mary went down the stairs together.
You're early.
You want to leave at the last minute?
He's an atheist.
I thought you might be mad at me.
I give up.
I know her very well.
What's in the beach bag that's in your car trunk?
I don't trust women.
He's an atheist.
Drugs can ruin your life.
Don't go, Tom.
