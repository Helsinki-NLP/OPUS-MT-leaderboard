FANO Russian Federation will hold a final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO Russian Federation) will hold the third expert session “Evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year and will be reported in a press release issued by Lenty.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the work of the Expert Session for the year and to provide a final list of indicators for the evaluation of the impact of scientific organizations.
Individual participants are planning to discuss the rules for the establishment of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of scientific groups and the evaluation criteria.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to establish a unified approach for all three academics to the methodology for assessing the impact of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have done so, and the final version of the normative instruments is in agreement.
As a result of the coming session, we must complete the development of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," said the Chief of the Expert and Analysis Office of the Russian Federation, Elena Aksenov.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred Russian academic institutions.
As a result, the adoption of the resolution is expected.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at the following address: Moscow City, Soljanka Street, House 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars.
Astrophysicists at the University of California in Santa Cruz studied the turbulence and its impact on chemical homogeneity in star formations.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow for the search of related stars, that is, those from one cluster.
The results of their studies were published in the journal Nature and are briefly available on the University website.
The same chemical composition of the nearby stars is caused by the turbulent movement in the clouds of gas prior to the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can be determined by the location of its birth and the region of the formation of the stars.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of the star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from the relative to the cluster.
Modelling by astrophysicists shows that such differences should not occur.
In their study, the supercomputer modeled two interstellar gas streams that formed the cloud together.
For millions of years, this object is transformed into a cluster where the stars begin to form.
Scientists added labels to the original gas streams and found that rapid turbulence in the cloud results in a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
According to astrophysicists, their research has shown that chemical stars can be found and that possible regions of the creation of such objects can be identified.
Carrat police arrested 20 years after high speed motorcycle chases
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at a speed of 125 km/h in a 70 km/h speed zone and through the Bushland to hide from the Pilbar Police.

Lavrov: Russia will not "kick the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia won't "kick the door" in connection with new sanctions.
Sergey Lavrov, head of FID, spoke to students and teachers of IGIMO today.
Regarding our responses to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even think, fantasize, because everything has to be specifically calculated, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be connected to a door slamming, some insults falsely understood, the minister emphasized.
First of all, we will distance ourselves from our interests, the interests of protecting our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners on their adequacy, coherence and reliability.
On the steps being taken in the area of sanctions, what partners are seeking can be very well judged - continued the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
If they say, "They'll be painful for us too," but we have to go to Russia to punish," it's probably not enough."
With regard to the WTO exit of the RF in response to possible new sanctions, no.
On the contrary, we want to take more actively the instruments of WTO, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, we believe, the EU's discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the Minister, Russia has been accused of dumping and has taken anti-dumping measures against the sectors of the Russian economy.
“We are ready to engage in WTO mechanisms and to defend our position that the third EU energy package should not be applied retrospectively” said Lavrov.
How is it right to use cheese in garden design?
Irina Okunev answers the questions:
Since the cheese is devoid of its main appeal after flowering, it is desirable to plant it with other artisans.
It perfectly combines with many cultures.
With cheese you can and should plant both ornamental plants at different times and flowering at the same time.
Another plus cheese is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of different heights, improved bush, a bush with wide ground, and even the likeness of a garden bonsai, a tree with a curiously curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that suits your garden's design more.
In Carelia, a resident of Leningrad District was convicted of the sale of counterfeit money.
As reported in the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, a man engaged in his criminal activity in the Olonetsk and Segegez regions.
In addition to Carelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting the Vologodsk district, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets District Court.
In order to end the investigation of crimes committed in our Republic, he was set up in Seguez.
In the course of the investigation, several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money from the summer of 2013 proved to be wine.
At the end of June of this year, the criminal case file with the indictment was sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court ruled that the term of imprisonment should be replaced by four years, while in the general regime colony.
The verdict has not entered into force.
Recall that during the past week, two more counterfeit money collectors were sentenced to pay in the shops of Petrozavodsk.
The people of Azerbaijan also arrived in Carelia from St. Petersburg.
One was deprived of liberty for five years, the other was deprived of four.
Each fine of 500,000 roubles is imposed.
The verdict has not yet entered into force.
In Archangelsk, the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy, Dervis.
The rally, which took place at the regional centre, was devoted to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervis delivered military assistance to the USSR from the United States and Britain.
In the Archangelic rally, the memorial was held at the foundation stone of the future monument to the northern convoys, which is located on the coastal name of Sidov in Solombal.
The event brought together representatives of the veteran organizations Archangelsk, children from the cadets class.
We first met twenty-three years ago when a foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time today's event is not a celebration, but a day of remembrance of those who have not returned the sea," said the Chairman of the Council of Northern Marine Veterans Boris Karpov.
The event was followed by a performance by a city spirit orchestra, and the students of the cadets gave flowers to the veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the sign of Victory.
The rally ended with the placing of colors on the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formal bots, lead, wool and many other equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were also on board, with 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrikine fighter fighters in decommissioned condition.
At the same time, convoy escorts consisted of 16 British Navy vessels, two of which were aircraft carriers.
The ship ' s caravan was not discovered by the enemy and well reached the destination of Archangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that protected trade unions as civil law.
“Where trade unions, there are middle-class jobs”, says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat co-chaired by the Progressive Federation Congress.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Workers' Empowerment Act along with the Civil Rights Movement symbol, John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities in discrimination against trade unions as in other forms of discrimination by stopping the forces of rival trade unions
The amendment of the Labour Regulation Act in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for participation in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts and to receive compensation for damages and fines is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what allison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are to remember a very American thought.
Despite attacks by trade unions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans have once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans would remember when the country was simultaneously defending democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that Hideki Todzoo ' s paramilitary autocracy had been replaced by democracy.
Being fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in forming a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize and to negotiate and for collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that stated openly: “The right to form associations to protect and improve labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and every profession or activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal effect; measures aimed at this end will be considered unlawful.
When the former First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, was President of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the drafters included the guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his interests”.
For generations, Americans have adopted as an appropriate basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to establish civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and to participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to hear their voices in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the strength of the nation, but has increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have miraculously set up a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how we should.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the expansion of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions from long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the introduction of the Louisiana Act, which his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Louisiana Bobby Djinal in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who have been involved in abortion would be obliged to have the power to receive patients at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can continue to have legal abortions at this time, continuing to seek such authority.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing to act upon receipt of authority”, Judge John de Grievells wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled for a month in which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
The advocates of the right to abortion were pleased to meet this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to gain hospital authority.
“Today’s decision guarantees that Louisiana women will be protected from the tainted law, which seeks to deprive them of their health and rights”, said Nancy Nortap, President and Head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who has filed a motion to suspend the law from three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who had not spoken to the plaintiffs in the case and also applied for the authority of admission.
Louisiana was in 11 states that had enacted such laws, and the courts had recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in this state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Midwives and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say laws on admission impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
The opponents of abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing the clinic.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has the authority to admit to a hospital, reported the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were to cease to comply with the procedure, the doctor, in fear of his safety, would cease to carry out the procedure, the team reported.
Criticising this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for admissions await decisions.
The introduction of quotas for domestic products will lead to
At least half of the products for each type of product in the trade network range should be Russian production, according to the representative of Gosduma, Oleg Nilov of the “Just Russia” faction.
The Parliamentary has drafted a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, reports the News newspaper.
The document will be further detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to products that are not produced in Russia. "...> For the rest of the products produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its parcels to domestic producers," reported Nilov to the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article on the basis of the State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation, the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10 per cent for products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trading networks is part of the stimulus package for Russian producers.
There will be several times as many domestic goods on the stalls.
However, the initiative may have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to counsel at Nalogovík, a member of the independent expert centre, Sergej Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect would be positive and would lead to growth.
Plus, we're gonna have farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means profits will grow.
In addition, they will be given the right to dictate their terms and prices, as they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase the revenue of the budget, create new jobs, and some industries will start expanding, some more rapidly absorbing, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will fall several times, in fact, not immediately," said the expert.
Previously, Russian enterprises were often unable to try to put on local shops because of high competition by foreign analogues.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it is important to remember that food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market after all necessary harmonization and sanitation.
In other words, a moment of silence has now come when the former players have left and the new players have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, there was an increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in the prices of manufactured products," said AIF.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian Public Organization Russian Club of Financial Directors, by Tamara Kasyanov.
Of course, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category would enable the sector to be established for local producers.
In such a case, they will compete with each other rather than with goods that, through subsidies from another State, are cheaper.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will be fought between companies operating under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of their compatriots not all over the world.
And in this situation, trading networks will have to “touch” the share of Russian goods to half the range.
In this regard, there is growing concern that poor products will be placed on the latches.
Perhaps foreign products with broken labels will be placed in the form of products produced in Russia," adds the expert.
The negative effect of quotas is felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more advantageous to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by such a schedule, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinka does not rule out that the domestic product quota law may also affect consumers.
The point is that some Russian production products may be inferior to the import analogues, while the shops will be able to raise prices on the second as if they were in short supply.
In the early 2000s, economists again talked about the idea of importing substitutes in February because of the continuous devaluation of rubles.
In the face of difficult relations with the West, the issue of non-importation is now becoming even more urgent.
The Act is intended to oblige suppliers to be treated with domestic producers in order to form orders.
At that time, we will go much faster and more confidently on the way to import replacements, and the production planning system for the necessary products will be established in a shorter time period," said Member Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors where the potential was particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are actually able to fully cover the latrines of Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can also have a strong momentum.
As is known, the largest percentage of imports is preserved by cattle, ranging from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
65 to 70 per cent, however, are Russian products," Cassianov argues.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas for domestic products to facilitate imports and may accelerate the process.
However, this initiative will not, on its own, lead to an import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, as Litvinco is confident.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may still be imported from abroad, which means that there will be no full import replacement, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, there are few quotas, and domestic production is still needed in the country to meet those quotas.
These quotas are the same as and will be provided by the expert.”
Timeless diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that female cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent had lived five years after the diagnosis was established.
A leading researcher, Susan Jordan, of the Institute for Medical Research, at QIMR Berghofer, reported that 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
BOTTLE RESEARCH: New medicines can slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the existence of current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Women of older age and those whose cancer was at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the cities were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were not timely and possible.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons who specialize in gynaecological oncology, and they are mainly found in big cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distances, she suggested that an increase in the number of visiting services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and programmes to support people who were being treated far away from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that the long life expectancy of women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank of Elish Neves said that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open doors in Kuženersky region
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaybelak started in April of this year and took place on a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Government of Public Relations and Information, the construction of the facility was financed from the Republic budget, in accordance with the investment programme targeted.
The total area of the built-in treatment facility is almost 230 square metres.
This will provide medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaybelja and the villages of Dementjevo, Puncheriummal, Tuña, Fomici, Torajbelja, Shinur and Chashkaal.
The new Flehldsher-Acture post will replace the existing FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and its premises do not meet health and hygiene requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
The four-month-old son in distress will be brought to justice
She's going to be on the dock for killing her own child.
A criminal investigation into the 31-year-old resident of Novoceboxarsk accused of causing death was completed in Cheboxarsk.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year the accused, together with the four-month-old son, had arrived to celebrate the birthday of her best man's child in Cheboxara.
After a long curtain, the new chauffeur decided to stay with the guests and arranged for the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, the untidy woman put it next to her bed to feed her breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman fell on her son, killing him with a stranglehold.
Criminal case, reports U.S.S.S.R. in Chechuya, sent to court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of cross- sanctions, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not be included in the government's projections, the analysts of the "TB Capital" are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of the anti-sanctions would result in an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBC Daily writes.
According to the latest projections of the economy, inflation will be between 6.5 and 7.5 per cent in 2014 and below 6.5 per cent in the following year.
However, according to the Commersanto newspaper, this week the MER is expected to make “small but principled” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could lower inflation by 2015 to eliminate the expected recovery of population income.
It was projected that food sanctions for the Russian Federation would be in force one year before August 2015.
How could inflation be so high in this situation?
The current situation implies a sudden shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," said Minfina's newspaper source.
The GDP capitalists do not share the expectations of the government's financial and economic bloc for inflation and predict an 8 per cent increase in prices in 2014.
The main effect of the food bans will be with the possible introduction of sales tax (SMEs) in the regions of the RFF in 2015, convinced by experts.
An inflation peak of 9 per cent will be due on February, with annual price growth going down, experts believing.
By the way, last week Rosstat drew the first inflationary results after the RF imposed "accuracy sanctions".
AIF.ru asked the experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of FK AForex Analysis Department:
Prices are already rising by major segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products began to be valued, the Government had to launch measures to monitor price stability in a systematic manner in order to prevent the risks of unwarranted price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and dealers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason the price rises.
The rise in the consumer price index continues to be key factors in the pace of capital outflows, over-refunding of the banking sector by the Russian Megaregulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population to foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have acceded to sanctions against Russia.
If inflation pressure remained controlled, the basket value of the minimum set of products would not rise by 12 per cent in one quarter.
The ban on the import of food products has provoked the shock of the offer in the domestic market and has led to a completely logical increase in final value.
As we are unable to fully launch the substitution mechanism at this stage, as well as to improve the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the responses will continue to bear the risk of inflationary growth.
In addition, fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as poor prospects for economic growth, could well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Razwaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, it was also zero above the current level, and another case, which was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think an inflation rate of 8-8.5 per cent is going to be after a year.
Plato Maguta, managing the Fund Maguta assets
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is being successfully restrained, but if there is further pressure on the financial sector, above all, it can lead to some difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are traditionally shown in the purchases of the currency in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the CB RF and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the rubble, both by market and by government regulation.
But the increase in prices has traditionally begun after summer silence and may become more noticeable in this autumn.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is 7.5 per cent likely to prevail, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centres suffer from the decline in the number of homeowners
Such a decline due to the exceptional reduction in the number of household owners under 35 years of age may lead to the loss of tens of millions of pounds per year by the horticultural centres, according to the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, housing managers spend an average of 55 per cent on the amount that owners of their own houses spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized unplanned areas, the popularity of gardening in front of a parking lot and the reduction of garden size as other threats to the industry, estimated to be £5 billion annually.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners dropped from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest in Britain was the cost of household gardening.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that renting and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at the RHS, said: “The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden century” of retail trade in horticulture as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year with better weather following the adverse conditions of March and April last year.
Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out mass cleaning at the Landedelia Foundation
Three of the four heads of the Land Fund were replaced on Friday.
A total of three of the four heads of the Land Fund were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture only reported the removal of the Executive Director, Atanas Dobreva.
It's in the seat of Lausanne Vasileva.
On Friday, it turned out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund had been changed in silence.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatian Angelov, who had been responsible for State aid and the SAPARD programme, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the Trud newspaper.
I did not attend the board of directors of the fund because by law we are not members of the board, but I was informed later that I had been released.
I can't say why my dismissal is not reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to know more on Monday," she said to Angelov's publication.
It will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatov, who has so far been the head of Investment Loans at the central fund at the Zemdelia in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nikolay Dachev, was also released.
Up to this point, he was responsible for direct subsidies for EU-paying fields.
Zivko Zhivkov will be appointed as head of the Regional Directorate of the Landing Foundation in Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014.

Official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey challenges US diplomat in connection with espionage reporting
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has raised the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country for clarification on the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent reported that the US case loyal and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The Intercept, a German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet Journal, reported that documents provided by Edward Snowden, former US Homeland Security analyst, showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ignored the message, saying that all leading countries were spying on each other.
The previously reported information that the German chief intelligence agency had also made Ankara a target of exploration has given rise to a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
Major Chinese companies joined against Aliba
Chinese companies, including the largest commercial real estate developer in China, Dalian Wanda Group and the Tencent Holdings Internet giants (socials, messengers etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trade market with Alibaba.
However, it would be difficult to catch up with the wonders of the Chinese Internet, which left even its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com behind.
Union of the Largest
Companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($ 814 million) in the joint venture, 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each of the Internet companies, as stated in Wanda Group.
The company is scheduled to register in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social network in China, with some 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fancy hotel houses, Wanda operates at least 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 shopping centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a cinema studio and a theme park in Qingdao (town in eastern China on the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate profits at $960 million.
In addition, Wanda is owned by the American Film Network AMC Entertainment Holdings, making the company the world's largest cinema operator.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its trading centres, hotels and places of entertainment with e-commerce services, whose development will be the newly created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dun Tze, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new site should become the largest online to offline platform in the world, notes Dun Tze.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to involve buyers on the Internet to come to regular offline stores or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon sales services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the biggest online pie," said Wanda Wang Jianlin (citate on Bloomberg).
“There is no current O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances for all are approximately equal”, he said.
The Chinese Internet trade market is the largest in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., it will increase more than three times by 2015 compared with 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, bringing Bloomberg official statistics: this is a larger population of any country in the world except India.
And it is projected that by 2015, this number could grow to 850 million people.
Alliance of the Riches
President Tencent Ma Huaten had recently been China's richest man, but according to Bloomberg's Millionaires Index, Alibab Jack Ma had already captured him for $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes to his share in Alibaba.
The leader of Baidu Robin Lee is now third among the richest people in China, while Van Jianjin of Wanda is the fourth line of ratings.
“This battle is very interesting to observe: three of the richest people unite to challenge the richer,” said Bloomberg Director of the Chinese Electronic Commerce Research Centre at Hanzhou Tzao Lay.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to compete seriously with Alibab immediately after the creation, "Rome cannot be built in one day".
That Aliba is not so easy to compete with not only new companies, but well-deserved leaders of the world's Internet trade, is evidenced by the previous report on Alibab's financial performance in the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit for the period is almost twice as high as its combined competitive value - it grew nearly three times in annual terms and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has great potential for generating money, much thanks to its mobile applications," commented Bloomberg's report to an analyst from the Hong Kong Arte Research Service.
According to Alibaba's updated prospectus on the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, significantly higher than March (163 million).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions over the past quarter had to be made by mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could be held on 16 September.
The Road Show companies that preceded this event are starting on 3 September.
It is expected that Alibab's turn to IPO will become record in NYSE history and allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the United States stock exchange record was owned by the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held its initial stockholding with $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the trading networks should be Russian production, members of the Gosduma are considered.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
It is a matter of amending article 8, on the basis of the State regulation of trade activities in the RF and the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
Important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 per cent of domestic products in shops should be for each product type.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruit in the winter, so they will be "reduction" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which sets a reduced VAT rate of 10 per cent for all food products originating in Russia, reports News.
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced to the lower House of Parliament amending the FZ on retail markets, which proposes to reinvigorate agricultural markets in Russia, where small producers will be able to implement their products.
The Chief of Police of Magaluf is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of police and civil servants being extorted from the municipality of Calvin to the office of the Public Prosecutor of Malorca on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvia on the resort island of Malorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the scandalous Magalufe drinking centre.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online edition of Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and municipality officials to the office of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor of Malorca on Friday.
Two more local police officers were arrested by the Guards of the Spanish National Guard for allegations of corruption and will be interrogated with Navarro.
The Spanish daily edition of ABC reported that the disgruntled owners of nightclubs say that protectionism by the authorities is seriously affecting the state of their business.
"The thing is no longer to make money, it's to survive," one businessman told the court.
We must not endanger our livelihoods.
There's nothing to lose.
Magaluf was placed in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British breather who made 24 men disappear while running around bars.
Since then, the island’s authorities have been trying to stop bullying in a state of care among Magaluf’s restees, bringing to a minimum the number of scandalous alcohol attacks on bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage Bars together were fined at €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, mainly popular among young British vacationers, has also been the site of numerous alcohol accidents involving crazy entertainment known as “balconying” when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony in a hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WESNA has prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, torrential rains and strong winds that have affected the flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell into the city by 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a few short torrential rains, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured out nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After spring was released in the winter last week, the temperature dropped again to a maximum of 15.8C in the city on Monday.
The high-quality conditions are believed to have served as a reason for the delayed landing of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it got into the wind-flow zone, suddenly changing the speed or direction of the wind at short distance, and was forced to rise.
Wind surges reached 50 km/h on land at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to rise during the second landing, and the plane finally landed about 8:40 p.m.
The delay in this flight caused the subsequent delay in several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected at Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two castings.
Calculation of the estimate of construction sites in the RF will take place in a new way
Price, construction industry regulation, as well as connection problems, the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control of the networks.
FAS has established an expert board for building competition.
At its meeting, FAS Vadim Solovyev, Head of Control, Construction and Natural Resources, stated that “the calculation of the construction estimates today is totally incomprehensible”.
The regulatory basis makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unjustified price of construction, they are considered by FAS.
They suggest that the cost of building public buildings at the design stage should be determined on the basis of market prices for constructive solutions instead of the current estimates and unit costs for technological operations.
These proposals have been made in the road map and are now under consideration in the mine.
“The replacement of traditional estimated construction documents for the calculation of construction elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explained VRB Vadim Solovyev.
Now every bolt and nut is counted in the estimates, and it does not always seem possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation poor construction companies can bury “all tractors”.
In the past, the FAS agrees.
“The first cost conversion work for the design elements is already available: methodologies have been developed for the calculation of prices for constructive solutions, for the calculation of estimates for these indicators,” explained HWG, head of the Department of Urban Construction and the mineral architecture of Elena Zhukov.
As a pilot selected area of road construction.
However, experts believe that the problem is far more serious.
Anatoly Damianko, head of the construction company, said that the estimated standards were long overdue, but no other business mechanism had yet been proposed.
“However, as far as the proposed design calculations are concerned, this is not feasible in practice, since the construction of buildings is often used entirely different technologies”, he said.
It's no secret that the building is developing a lot thanks to the hospitality.
According to the Chairman of the NP Board, Ekaterina Lesina’s “Expert Association of Hoszakaza Professionals”, the State is the most able to pay.
The director of engineering at the Rosatoma Capital Building Centre, Vladimir Malachiov, drew attention to the fact that today the market is provisionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts and to companies that possess monopolistic competences and that do not allow competitors to do so.
He believes that it is possible to create a transparent market only if access to contracts is as secure as possible from someone managing it.
The expert board was invited to establish a system of hospice in such a way that the same contractor could not obtain more than one contract of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts of more than 1 billion rubes.
In the ministros it is believed that this approach should be assessed in terms of the impact on business as well as the effectiveness of building management.
As explained by Elena Zhukov, in this case, it would be necessary to provide the employer with the functions of the contractor, which would result in an increase in the staffing and budgetary costs of the contractor.
In doing so, the contracting authority will have the knowledge to assess the quality and safety of the work carried out by the contracting organizations.
Often, such a breakdown will need to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the loss of highly qualified purchasers due to the lack of interest in obtaining a public order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The titles of the Expert Advisory Centre of the Procurement Institute, Alexander Evstashenkov, believe that the procedure for the tender has now become a business game for the contractor's attention.
He cited this example: “The participant, when filling the application, should indicate “specific indicators” without the words “or equivalent”, “should be”, “may be”, “may be”, “may be”, “may be”, “not above”, “not above”, “not allowed” and so on.
Thus, contracting entities often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem 44-FZ, according to Evstashenko, was the need to assess the quality of work through the “paper” proposal of the participant at the time of the application.
In considering the application, it is only possible to assess the performance of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been undertaken, that is, the expert.
The quality of the work can only be measured if it is accepted.
The expert board also suggested that marginal income from the top to the lower echelon should be transferred to disappear intermediate contractors.
The President of the Expert Board, the State Secretary, the FAC Deputy Director, Andrey Karikovski, believes that this is not worth doing, since the task should be ordered by the contractor.
In other words, how does the famous Arcadia Rikina "Atheli", "What's the button of the claim?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school Monday after spending the summer in the shelters, when rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip were closed while the Territory was recovering from hostilities.
The start of schooling brought a sense of joy and excitement to those affected by the rockets to the settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the Pashós children's garden, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of debris from the walls and children's mountains before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're happy to look to the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that this is when she starts going to school "not weird" again.
"It was a difficult time, and we did not leave our homes at all," she said.
President Raven Rivlin visited Kibbutz, who is located near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire stopped the war last week, thousands of border settlers, such as Saad, did not go out or leave their homes, moving to safer areas further away from the Gaza Strip to escape missile and mortar fire.
Many Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubted that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which had suffered greatly from Palestinian fire.
He said to the children, "We will do our best to provide you with knowledge and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The Ceasefire Agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas ' demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down his arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of the killed were militants; nevertheless, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
66 soldiers and six civilians were killed on the Israeli side, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mines to Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out over 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and it is estimated that 250,000 people have found refuge in over 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in the shelters and the fighting continued, education officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon open up so that we can complete our education, like children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy now living in a school in Gaza.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter increase in seven years.
The housing value index RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital grew 1.1 per cent in August, the RP reported on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined increase in June, July and August by 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 per cent, more than twice the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Director Data Tim Loules reported that Sydney and Melbourne maintain a two-level market.
Figures of RP Data show that in Sydney housing prices have risen by 16.1 per cent over the last year, while in Melbourne, by 11.7 per cent.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin were the next in power markets, with an average price increase of between five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was followed by government cuts, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowlesss said that now, when spring started, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items put up for sale in the next few months, which would be a "real test" for the market.
“In taking into account the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to rise in the next three months”, he said.
How People Live in Ufa’s Oldest House
In the former home of gold miners and miners of Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov in the streets of the October Revolution 57/1 (the former Grand Kazakh) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has remained virtually unchanged since the construction period, apart from its branching.
Foreign people go here as a tour, and residents suffer more than they enjoy, than their privileges, the right to live in the oldest Ufim house, whose walls are remembered by General Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, and historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out that the building is no longer 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, creaky stairs.
The doors of the apartment are close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the streets are visible in areas covered by the plaster.
Seems like everyone's holding on to an honest word.
And the locals say, "You don't think it's true."
Living in the village house of the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatiana Lukyanov, resident of apartment No. 3.
The facility is in the hospital, but the money for its contents is not spent for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still clinging thinly, but the foundation is all rotten.
Many residents still go to the bathroom on the street and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be content with such circumstances?!
The road goes right under the windows, there's no pedestrian zone.
Tatyana's pushing the curtain off.
Now you can see what you've heard before: car flows under the windows.
You see, the glass is always drifting, the windows aren't open, they're used to the noise.
But man is accustomed to all things, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still model, thank your husband, his hands are gold.
More than that, we have two rooms, living three times with our son.
And other families have much worse conditions, and on the second floor, the ceiling is only a little over a foot and a half feet high.
To contrast, Tatiana proposes to visit a neighbor from Apartment No. 6 Ludmile Starostina.
A pleasant, hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have one room apartment, 14.5 m2 per four people, and we live: my husband and daughter with my granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another living room - Ludmila surrounds the room with her eyes: antresoli, two couches with the letter "g"; one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and very little differs from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, “historical”.
But the ceiling is leaking regularly: the plumbing system is not suitable anywhere.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment as being ordinary and astoundingly at the same time as the Italian woman whose home is in the ruins of Rome.
That is, it brings into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The plumbing took place about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former cholan.
We live on the second floor, where Demidov and his family lived.
Our apartment isn't privatized, is it?
In the Real Estate Centre, Ufah says privatization does not matter.
We'll get only one room apartment, we can't claim more.
It was four months ago that we were promised to settle down, but the promise did not go away.
I'm not used to complaining, and I'm not.
There was a dynasty in this apartment: my grandparents, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter with my granddaughter.
There's been a lot of time.
For example, healthy rats fled into the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flagel, they're a metric thickness!
They say the solution was mixed in with the eggs, so it's been holding on for so long.
The house is built thoroughly, thanks to Demidov!
Maybe that's why it didn't kill anyone with a broken ceiling or its own.
Only a building slowly dies in front of us: the boards and the logs of the house rot, the fields have failed, we have poured cement, but all the useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say so, under our secret bed room and the move to the Bela River, which specifically made some old-timers here to avoid danger, in the event of which.
They were followed.
Ludmila Starostina tells us how some historian came to them, begged him to let him begin his excavation at the apartment.
And then he talked them into giving them a living room in exchange for his unit on October Avenue.
Sophia’s story refused:
Where are we at four o'clock?
And even here, there's a tiny hope that will give housing more space.
We'd agree to an exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
After all, the Starry family didn't win.
Ludmila's biggest dream of being settled, and her daughter's 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families were granted a two - room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations now live.
A cute, miniature girl named Olesa Karsakov from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, a large family lives in two small rooms of a total area of 23 m2 called apartments.
We're all seven people, two children.
See for yourself what the terms are.
The floor is covered with piecework, like window frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms of the crossholes.
The water in the tap is only cold for a year.
As we walk through the apartments of the old Oufa house, we can be sure that the best of all was for the wives of Lawrence from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, lots of places!
Seventy-five squares, three people.
We live in exactly those rooms where Suvorov was legendally staying during his stay in Ufe, says the head of the family Alexander Dmitriewich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing is, it's all going around, it's going down, it's going down.
The neighbors must have already told us!
The most tormented of us with the sexes: wooden boards rotted, the ground literally went from under our feet.
I've set up the pads, the wedges; there's nothing in the room, and in the other room, we walk, like the ducks, it's all so tight.
Alexander Dmitriewicz can tell a better guide about the home of the merchant Evdokim Demidov.
The gold industry is like a native, and it is admired.
In fact, the identity of the master of the Kaginsky and Uziang factories was immaterial: he built houses, he poured out his guns and his bell towers, and he held Uralian mines.
The heirs of the property are proud, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitriewicz.
At that time, wooden quarters for carriages, stables, and caravans were then demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to take our house away, but something went wrong.
History has been repeated in 2014: again they have been taken with new housing.
As a team, we collected all the documents, protected the necessary authorities, and suddenly we learned that the move to apartments was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lawrence went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bascortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
Officials didn't take the apartment.
They sent from one table to another, and then, in a ridicule, they issued a paper without signatures and seals: “The Ministry of Culture does not object to housing”.
I even had this feeling that our house was long gone because at first it was number 57, then it was 57 A and now 57/1.
It's like he's been taken down in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has referred to the Head of the Information and Analysis Branch of the Land Administration of Ufa Vladimir Barabas.
A house on the streets of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the programme of settlement of the high housing sector.
I can't be responsible for the actions of the 70s, but I know there was a plan to demolish all the old houses at the time, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, but the decision of the modern authorities to rebuild all old houses on the streets of the October Revolution, which are of architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
Residents are about to move into new apartments.
According to Barabbas, the restoration of the House of Demidov will be by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
There is now an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire old Kazanska Street will be restored, says the official.
Homes will acquire the right kind, corresponding to the one they used to be, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be a museum open to all.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street walkable on weekends.
Unfortunately, the wake won't work, too busy roads in the city.
Displace people from the future of Vladimir Barabbas Museum promises in 2015.
After all, it is unlikely that they will be satisfied that their new apartments will be the same as the present one.
Only from another age.
Forest fire started in Primorje due to the thunderstorm
The dry storm caused a forest fire in the territory of the Fireland District of Primorsky.
Inflammation is being increased by a grouping of forces and means.
According to the KHSBU management “Primorus Airbase”, the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of the aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Air Force Chief:
A fire in a hard-to-reach area was detected by an observer aircraft from an An-2 patrol aircraft with an area of 3 hectares.
There's wood residue on the old burner.
The harshness of the area and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the absence of suitable landings for fire-extinguishers poses considerable difficulties in the shower.
We need a MI-8 helicopter.
The supply of airbases by Mi-2 and An-2 is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four fire extinguishers were quickly planted.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and to prepare the area for additional fire-fighting forces and means.
In the area of lunch, three fire brigades were additionally transported to the village of Ottnići by helicopter.
Once the helicopter landing site in the area of the fire is ready, experts will be relocated to the site of the shower, reports to the website of the Primor Region Administration.
My father never embraced me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born into the family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry's rehearsing comedy, "The Rare Rudi Plates", which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio 4 transmissions.
Sundtrek is a mixture of reggi and rap, and melodies are life-joyed.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother died, there was “a lot ” treatment, and Henry often thought about his father’s relationship with him.
He was very unavailable.
You've never seen his face, you've heard his voice say, "Stop making noise.
Get away from your sister.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him, and talked about things like the form of a beer cup, the beauty of the kick in the shriek.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was such an unmistakable guy in the corner who read the paper for most of my life.
He had recently opened a Lithuanian workshop in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, smokey, the depths of the labyrinths of fires and smoke and dogs of soot.
My dad went into the bathroom and he was just lying there, and you heard him sing slowly about himself because he wanted to wash away from the Lithuanian workshop.
When I got there, I realized that he had done it for years and years to make us a living, and I came to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry left his childhood without parental love.
My father never knew, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the end of her life did we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked in his childhood.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why wouldn't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, and he's been married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry himself had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very improved, and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I began a serious study with the fitters, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry's career path change is perhaps reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he's been recognized as critics for his Otello, he's been totally caught in the theater.
There was a Comedy of Mistakes, and then August Wilson's "The Exclusions."
This work differs from the sitcoms and comedys, which were an integral feature of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
Dejay noticed how he parodies on stage, and he wrote about it in "New Faces."
His career on television began in the mid-1970s: "I was the only black parody/comy on television for quite a long time."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow in front of the audience, I had to learn to be an effective machine for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Faces" 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Menstrual Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blackened their face," Henry found that he had been in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of wish it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked in large squares and learned to work with a crowd.
But what was “the winner of the light entertainment classic on British television for years and years” was also the “Gross Parade for Black People”.
Presenting the characters who had abused and succeeded the culture of black people in Britain, Henry worked in an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of Shaw Lenny Henry was broadcast in 1984, and in the '90s he was known as, among other things, Chef Gareth Blacklock of the comedy show "Shef!".
Advertisers, documentary films, televisions and movies took ten years to live in the movie, but after his 2008 BBC series "Lenny Henry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because you don't seem to be dragging your time or your silence to the side?"
Then there was a series of documentary transmissions on Radio 4 called "What's good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
I can't say I was taught to do that at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with cobblers and bonnets downstairs.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the broadcast, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't worry about it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words aloud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Otello monolo for documentary transmission, and he got caught.
I had a feeling I could do this.
It's like my head's been fixed.
"That's what this is, that's a serious matter, taking it seriously, studying your text, doing a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it in.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the Comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I'm in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was this moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical disturbance, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to entertain the public.
"The silent voice inside me said, "You'll have to work for 10 minutes while they're making a computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene, and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You play the play, stay in the play."
Henry at Zaborah in Dachess Theatre
It was difficult to learn the text for "Burns".
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the musculature.
She was well received, too, so it was like a sign above saying, "That's what you have to do."
He says that, of course, by a thunderstorm.
So I'm holding onto it.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal hall.
By the way, Henry still has the idea of a comedian - our entire conversation is interrupted by the flashes of his humor when he begins, it ends to parodie.
I just decided not to work in the standup because this thing with instant gratification from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you're always trying to do this, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work for the Apollo Air Force when I want to, but mostly, I don't get the pleasure I used to.
I'm asking if he'll give us a tour of the standup someday.
I don't think I'll ever want to give it up.
So that's his new appearance?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began the biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government ' s payment statement.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid in a government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after they have left the public service.
President Uhuru Keniat promised to reduce corruption in public structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700000) per month was lost by payments to "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that wages continue to be paid to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC reporter Vanjam Chebusiri from the capital city, Nairobi.
All public servants should be present within the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data are collected through a biometric registration procedure, reported in a government statement.
Anyone who does not do so for no good reason will be deleted from the payment statement.
“This procedure significantly contributes to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the payment statement at both levels of the Government - hence, to put an end to the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Wiguru, secretary of the Cabinet of Planning and Structure of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers were arrested in connection with a “consultation” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of conspiracy against the Government, reported by local information agencies.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Huriette Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption-detection activities in the past December, which aimed to inspect government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to the telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic clergyman Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer break.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenius Yacenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the awaiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony did not take place in every school on September 1st.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful skies.
All of Ukraine, a huge single Ukrainian people's front, must fight for peaceful skies.
Aleksán Pastehov, head of the school in Slavyansk, where Yacenjuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impressive leader as she needs.
It is followed by a banner of fame from the world of banking, media and internal affairs of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in decision-making.
Her career began at a consulting firm on global management of Bain and Co and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world of media in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, after resigning, when a senior member of Pearson's chief company took on a man with a lower position.
It's said to be close to £1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband's former advisor, Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the chair a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but an internal paradox exists within it.
The Council has two objectives: inside as the top management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but I will also be out there as a voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly that needs full radical reform.
However, what new president would risk coming, trampling and destroying the institute as difficult as the Chinese dynasty if he himself would lose his job in the process.
It's a tough decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC decrease in size, after the revision of its powers, financial status and status.
As competitors narrow down and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of licences pose a particular danger to the BBC.
At a modest amount of £145,50 a year, the British are buying a share in the world’s largest media enterprise, of course.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and each of them are only 40p per day.
Moreover, Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC viewing and use models have changed: I now receive news headlines on a mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive president, I hope it's found him.
Perry from Texas says that a humiliating tweet was written by someone outside.
Tweet from Governor Texas's confirmed Republican figure, Rick Perry, held an insulting image of the district prosecutor from the Democrats on Sunday evening, which is at the centre of the prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which the record was decimated.
I just published a tweet from my account that was written by someone outside.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I removed it," says a later record.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to a request to comment.
Although the records were loaded from the confirmed Perry account, it was not clear who was actually involved in publishing this tape.
A more early tweet held a heavy caricature for the prosecutor of the Trevis Rosemary Lemberg District, who found himself guilty of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry banned funding from her agency when she refused to resign, resulting in a large jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 elections.
Your signature says, "I don't always drive a car drunk, three times the blood alcohol allowed, but when I do, I blame Governor Perry for what he tells me."
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg did not investigate a large jury against Perry.
Michael McCrumm, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry didn't plead guilty and called the charges a political hoax.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the governor who had served longer than everyone in Texas's history would be vague, contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from State Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County and pursues corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
Veto filed a formal complaint by a group of left-wing public controls.
The book of confirmed Perry is often updated and sometimes becomes famous.
With the fifth party at the party's convention in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumors that he could leave the game by tweeting a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to “normal state”
One of London's most famous founders warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England had “returned to a normal level of activity”.
The home in the capital was subject to a lively demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England into imposing restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday: “From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since the peak of 2013, adding that it has provided “a stable working environment”.
London’s real estate market prevailed during the recession, as foreign buyers moved to the capital city.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land cadastre, significantly bypassed the average of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales in general.
Average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes of Berkeley increased by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also halted the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential "foothold on specialties" before the general elections in next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, under which tighter lending conditions were introduced, would also reduce market growth both in real estate sales and in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England showed a decline in approved mortgage loans in June on Monday, implying a further cooling of the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its forecast price growth for London's real estate by 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that the real estate price sentiment has already begun to weaken.
Transactions then dropped by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Maypher and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for homes in the capital has proved very beneficial for Berkeley by raising sales volumes above £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgeley added: "The demand for the right product with good design and the best location has remained the same and, reflecting this, the sale for the right time has been maintained."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April -- almost a third more than in the 2007 pre-crisis peak.
Annual returns to taxes rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, a return of 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgeley reported that the expected earnings of Berkeley for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, profits are expected throughout the year prior to the tax payment of £450 million.
Berkeley's shares were held at £23.96 in the afternoon at the London Exchange.
Pictures of Jennifer Lawrence naked are published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th annual American Film Academy Award.
The photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar Award, were presented on the Internet by a hacker who assures that he has a "catalog" of 100 more rising stars.
The representative of the Star of Hunger Games confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence were real, and condemned the hacker for “a sudden invasion of personal space”.
The law enforcement authorities have been contacted, and they will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photographs that were originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange website were allegedly generated by the lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the break-in includes dozens of female celebrities, including Rianna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Keith Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these photos are true, although the star "Scott Pilgrim vs. All" Winstead in Twitter also condemned the break-in.
"The one who looks at the pictures that we took with our husband a few years ago when we're alone at home -- I hope you're proud of yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victoria-winner" denied that in the photos she wrote in Twitter: "These are the so-called photos exposed to me, FALSHIVIKI, people.
Let me stop it in the embryo.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of Ariana Grande's pop star denied that the photographs on which she was supposed to be true.
An exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel of love and the letter "J" engendered praise for critics
They were dissolved, and the best thing to say was, they were gradually falling apart, like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy in communication, tense, closed and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw anger in him.
He was as thorny as a string, yes.
The last victim of this thorny thing was a little novel, which he expected more than usual, to get rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a fragile beauty with broken hair and a shivering heart from the northern island village, even more distant and cruel than Port Royben.
She came south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered to be her aunt, and the latter received an inheritance home in gray but similar to a valley paradise called the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The trumpets were running, and the spiders were sitting still in the tubs, and they slipped their footprints on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was full of peacocks, like giant cobblers.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, at the same time frightening and charming, with a complete secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the long list of the Booker Prize in 2014.
The short list will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eylene were sitting by their hands, in broken lounges among the tall grass, enjoying an unexpected warm spring day; they were both scatteredly attached to a cheap console that provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when he remembered an old song of a long-forgotten black artist, whom his father loved to listen to, dropping the blinds in the house.
You have too big legs.
In view of their inherent aggression, the songs of this kind on the console were no longer lost.
They were not forbidden - nothing was actually forbidden - just no longer lost.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic."
The public tasted what could never have been achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as people among the books chose the memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, culinary books and love novels, they chose balads from all over the music.
After that day, Kevern took up playing the imaginary piano and a rude comic voice to cheer up the big legs of Aileen.
Eileen didn't understand.
"This was a popular jazz piano player named Fats Waller," he told her, mechanically applied two fingers to her lips.
That's how his father always did it to stop the letter "J" before she came off his lip.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the "J" word by forgetting to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew it was what they wanted him to do, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz wasn't playing either, although it wasn't explicitly forbidden.
Improvization's out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
That's the same with wit.
His unpredictability worked on people's nerves.
And jazz was the wits of music.
Although he reached 10 years of age, he never heard of Sammy Davis Mladšem, Kavern knew about jazz from his father's half-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eylene that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The society was obedient, and this meant that each segment agreed with gratitude - thanks to those who were protected by fate - to the principle of group predisposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent by temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for entertainment and sports, and they sang and ran.
Out of Indonesia, as if nature were talented in everything about electronics, no family would be left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was done by the sanitary work; what was left of the Greek plate.
Those who left the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose grandfathers did not rush to leave the country, when what had happened, if there had been a war in the past, in fear that they would be accused of burning flames, in fear, in fact, that the flame would swallow them up next, opened restaurants with labs and potassiums, were not drained and squandered from idleness.
Every ability.
Since she had heard only the balads before, Eileen found it hard to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just given her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Unless maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the garden had given him an illusion of security.
No word could penetrate the sound of giant leaves like cabbage.
Eileen didn't understand.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on her lips again.
She already thought it was weird.
"To him it seemed ridiculous," he said instead.
She unconfidently lifted her head by shutting down Queer's review.
There was nothing in the world but the spear of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're eating it for me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Legs, maybe a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so sick of this.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to fool him often led him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could ease the cruelty of jesting.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, too, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons rose and rose from the shekel, dropping the console and spilling the wine they drank.
The bottle of wine, so the intoxication could not justify it.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like leaves of palm trees in the hurricane.
"And I like you just because you have a stupid head," she said...
I don't like you, though.
He felt sorry for her and because of the harshness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in the cold north archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the main features she looked like here.
The same huge ice ocean struck both of them.
The same men who had been beaten by so many men, even more sensitive and capricious after what had gone through, were more likely to go out than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered from pub to pubs, ready to raise their hand against any woman, and dared to deny or irritate them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid doll if she wasn't careful!
At first they would kiss - kiss now is the most common expression of erotic annoyance between a man and a woman; the antidote from the fresh ballast that the console was to kiss her and then strike her.
It's too much to explain, according to Kevern, because you've been a bully by yourself.
Eileen Solomon’s body showed that he had to leave.
He got out of the closet like an old man.
She felt the weight of lead herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave the window, and she watched him leave the window, and her companion was a man who was putting his own weight on him.
Adam, who was leaving the garden, thought.
She felt a sense of compassion for him and the men at all, even though some of them raised their hand.
The man who turned away from her, with his back folded, bowed down, fought down, all his ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she could not remember a single case until today when she saw it?
Once again, Aileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or around that Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Ofnau, the informal public mood control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to be reduced if it did not stop at all, given the means and forces allocated to its eradication.
“Many things have been done, and much is done,” she wrote, “to alleviate the innate aggression of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow settlements of the area where, despite the burning of churches over the fences, the gentle breathing of human kindness has rarely been felt throughout history.
Some qualities, however, prove to be inexhaustible.
The higher the spire seems, the lesser the passion it gives rise to.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows up stories of overcoming obstacles, and proclaims its shallow faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only does old rudeness remain strong in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is evidence of new and vicious upheaval in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have an annoying habit of writing too much," said her scientist, reading the report completely.
I think you should read smaller novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her head down.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any prejudices here.
We are the servants of society without prejudice.
But some forms of hypersensitivity, totally acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, may at times distort the results, such as what you have shown me.
Obviously, you're prejudiced against the church yourself, and what you call "wicked" and "grossy," others would interpret as an expression of natural selfishness and energy.
To continue to be bored about what happened to her, if anything, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, would have deprived the country of its vital strength.
Esme Nussbaum looked on the sides while the rabbi spoke.
Under his head, rosy as flamingo, LED letters repeated the advice that Ofnau gave the country for the last quarter of the century or more.
Smile for your neighbor, value your husband, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A better word of silence, a better word of song than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," said Esme Nussbaum quietly, when I was convinced that her academic leader had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been treated as effectively as we believe ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that originally led to what had happened if WE had been after.
Only this time will we vent our anger and distrust against others.
Luther Rabinowitz tied his fingertips together in a pyramid.
This gesture should have meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "called "mistakes" of actions that our grandfathers did or did not commit.
You go too far and when you say that they threw their anger and mistrust at the others.
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that in understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "us".
There was no "us" and there was no "other."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Who, to be honest with herself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done, it was done.
It was then.
There's nothing more to say: we agree here.
And if you don't blame anyone, you don't have to apologize if it's appropriate or if something could be fixed.
But why the past, if not to learn,
The past is for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that,
The pyramid, Luther Rabinovica, collapsed.
"I'll look at your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went on the sidewalk, as the passers-by described, "in an angry rage."
Coincidences occur.
Lesotho Army states that the coup has not been planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The army of Lesotho denied the preparation of the coup to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, stating that the country's army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, claiming he had been threatened with his life.
The army representative, Major Ntlé Ntoi, stated that there was no coup, but that the army was responding to the threat of the “political fanatics” whom the police tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the commander of the Lesotho Armed Forces has taken action by receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police force that really plan to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to stage chaos," he told the Voice of America.
A representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monjela, said that the actions of the army looked like a coup.
"Although no one has claimed power by force, it is clear that the actions of the Lesotho armed forces currently have the main signs of a coup," he said.
The army of Lesotho reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing manages the Government in the absence of Taban.
Tabane stated that he believed that he had been attacked by an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his unified government.
He stated that his actions had not been undermined by the Government despite the allegations of the contrary.

A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the near future for medical examination.
In the past season, he went to the London Club field only three times.
Let's just remind you that Milan used to rent from Liverpool's assaulting Fernando Torres.
Production in the euro area at the lowest level in 13 months
The growth in euro area production slowed to the lowest 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the Business Activity Index (PMI) of the euro area production sector on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and businesses suffered from growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values came before the European Central Bank (ECB) Assembly on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank on how to stop the recovery of the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation in inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
There is a suggestion that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, may later this week provide additional signals that he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent," said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 11 months mark 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of real concern, as is Italy's weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth rate of the tail is mainly the industrial engine, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
Industrial deceleration is likely to be fuelled by oil in the fire by analysts who expect additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI had grown to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "Better what you can say about August's study of the euro area industry's business activity index, what it shows is that the sector is still growing."
He added: “Eurozone manufacturers are apparently finding a very difficult life at present, as the current growing geopolitical tension, especially those associated with Russia/Ukraine, adds uncertainty to the still complex conditions in many countries.
This increased tension seems to have hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and it is likely that some orders are being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "more and more like," that the ECB would eventually have to do some kind of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect it would be limited."
The people of Mariupoli will raise a living chain against the militias.
Before last week in Mariol, everything was quiet - no one dared to organize the People's Republic of Mariol, a city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the residents are looking forward to the arrival of the militia.
According to the version of the political scientists, separatists are breaking into Mariopolis to go to the Azov Sea - the city of Novozazowski was recently taken, which was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupolits decided that the Ukrainian army would, however, protect them, but it had little against the well-armed representatives of the DNR-LNR and had gathered to help the military.
They spin trenches, build posts and strengthen.
On Saturday evening, several thousand inhabitants arrived on the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a living chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They intend to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and drive supplies, collect drugs, publish newspapers.
Shops are gradually closed in the city, banks and ATMs are being shut down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the brutal occupation of school, like the children who have been in it, still suffer.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of whom children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the atrocities at school.
Ten years later, following the terrible capture of the Belaan school, 334 people were killed, including 186 children, and the heroic survivors of the disaster warned yesterday evening of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new fourth, it seemed to be some sort of extreme evil.
Tragedy united the East and the West in perversion, which then miraculously increased hope and hope for the future in the midst of the worst tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had deceived death during the atrocities at school.
We have discovered the amazing young people who have faced tribulation, although the memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is currently wreaking havoc on Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now cease.
A girl who's trying to get back to a shooting gym in a photo
She was sealed on a photo of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitry Beljakov, when she tried to get back in one of her underwear in a shooting gym after the mine exploded.
Aida was desperate to find her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
There were fears that they both died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run away from everything, but I couldn't," said Aida at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few shells remain in my lap.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it," she said with a call.
"This has happened to me, and this fact cannot be changed.
I always go to this gym once a year to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it the other day.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, was murdered there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says that the grip remains with her, although the memories are a little short every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our distresses, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I'm going to go to the school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, find out about our tragedy and make sure it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through a hail of bullets thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at 7 years of age) and survived three days of capture by hugging Tamara's mother.
Then he was seven, and he said, “Mother told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.”
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Flee."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed the baby by the arm and ran through the city of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who took his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara went free and was in a hospital with injuries on her feet, thinking that her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (the now non-existent News of the World), where he was rewarded as a Child Protector from the Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry Foundation.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Anyway, I can tell you that I remember he's missing.
I remember throwing away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think of myself.
I remember those kids I used to play in the yard with who never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted and travel in the car with an open top.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the grief that he and his friends have experienced.
That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a women's convent.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve in the police someday, and I hope I'll be enrolled in the school academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 kids were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence immediately after the capture, there were simply no children to scream and run around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people at the other end of the earth could understand our feelings and support us.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat the brothel, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters at the restaurant, and Damir shot them from his water pistol, and they ran and played with him.
And it's only been a month since our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I don't think this world has gotten any better in the last 10 years.
There's a war going on in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think for many people war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, and he's not aggressive or evil at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six schoolmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and they light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it. I remember him lying on the couch turning away from us for hours.
He wasn't asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell around me when parts of the bodies were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, "Damir, run, run," but I was so sure again that he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgiy Ilin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after capture became the determining factor for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: the survivors of Beslan Georgie Ilin and his mother Fatima after their capture in 2004, and Georgie's case today
There was a reflection of fear on his besieged face when he was saved from death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking signs of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, was 54 years old, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir’s eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she remembered.
Not entirely alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George survived.
The closer that date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no day when we do not recall this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of those days all the time I have eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
It goes into the soul: a photo of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie trying so hard to go to school the day he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of Georgia crying in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and she's hidden in the bookcase in our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this photograph makes people all over the world feel our pain.
Georgie now says, "It's important that this never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
We need decades to forget her a little bit.
She's affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares because of the grab, but now it's better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was really scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before every 1 September.
I want to give a tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical school in Vladikaukuza.
I'm going to study to become a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health wouldn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgij Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Incredibly: Georgie Farniev was at the feet of a killer terrorist while he was taken, but he survived.
During the seizure, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
In fact, it's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," said George, who wanted to study for an FSB intelligence officer, but failed to do so because of the damage caused by his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say kids are easy to deal with bad things, and I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget that.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting on this famous photo.
Survived: Georgi Farniev today with a laptop photo of himself in the hospital after capture
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as physical condition is concerned, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with my knee, which was damaged, but now I'm walking fine.
But health didn't allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg like I wanted.
I sent out my papers, including medical reports, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second attraction was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children should know, and of course not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42 years old, said: "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is coming.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to commemorate her.
I know Georgie won't go.
For him, she must be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgie's a grown-up now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair is happening to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He's had several operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's over this nightmare by 50 percent, but it's impossible to get over it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during a seizure, and this only increases my pain.
I've lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I find that hard to believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If we could take all the rebels and throw them away, as far as we can.
Alena Tskawa, 10 years old
A young man who was moved to a safe place by a special forces fighter
Rescued: Alon Zkaev is carried to a safe place by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now she is ten (right), and she has no memory of a terrible crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alana carried a Russian police officer out of a kidnapped school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but with cruelty left her 30-year-old mother, Christian's ten-year-old sister and brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, who was three years old, was saved, but Alenina’s mother and sister were killed in a deadly battle.
Her father Ruslan had married again since then, and they have a little daughter with his new wife, Svetlana, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
The deer, which is now ten, does not remember anything about the capture and flourishing in a smart and vibrant girl, the neighbors say.
"They are a great happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children," a close friend said.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is observed.
You can understand why.
Synji Kagawa, a half-protector, returned from Manchester United to the Dortmund Borusia, noted that he was looking forward to getting out again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous event in a career.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm gonna play for Borusia again, which is Kagawa's Bild.
I feel really good.
It's full of positive emotions, and I'm looking forward to getting back into the field in the form of "Brussia".
To remind you, Kagawa moved to "MU" from "Bourusia" in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to join the English Club in two seasons of only 38 matches in the England Championship, killing 6 balls and giving 8 effective gears.
Men charged with encountering a girl on foot in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be brought to trial on a three-year-old girl on foot on a pelican crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly knocked down a girl on the road to Pitttenwin in East Newka.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart was taking his Audi Q3 with no due care and attention and knocked the girl down, resulting in trauma.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt before Sheriff's Court of Dundee.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal attorney, set the date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland will not load up in Vladivostok
Duty Free Airport Free Trade Shop Vladivostok has posted a table prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders in this shop.
Do not burden them with spirits, vodka, and cognac.
The U.S. Administration decided that President Barack Obama, Chancellor of the FWG of Angel Merkel, President of France François Allland, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known associates would not be able to load with vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
And she put a plate on the door.
In the past, Obama had been banned from being even less accessible by the department of the facility - Dietary dining halls of the IGO, as reported by the web-site of the establishment.
Whether the U.S. President ever dreamed of eating at a dietary cafeteria in Russia is unaware, but the authors of the ban seem to be terribly witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo? Medvedev gave advice to the Agrarians
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of Russia believes that under the embargo, Russian agrarians should adopt new technologies in order to produce their cheese buyers.
The Council was given during a visit to the company "South-Ptycepter" of Agroplex.
The Head of Government also advised the restorationists to reorient themselves to the Russian meat, whose quality is at the proper level.
The annual food import embargo has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
The main coach of the collective Russia Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result given the lack of targeted training for competitions.
Our athletes have spoken at their level, "The All Sports" by Maslakov.
The third is confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We must bear in mind that we have not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not committed our leaders to the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become the second in this tournament, but this season we have had a collection.
On the contrary, the French have set up a fighting team of 13 European champions.
They did not conceal their intention to win this year, as they had repeatedly declared publicly.
But even such a team of competitions couldn't stand the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken to such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were lower than in the same Brillian League.
Season's over.
Of course, sportsmen are no longer such an important result, especially in command-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And as a result, I agree, it was absurd for men to be so involved in tactical fissures that they ran below the average level of... women's runs.
4 suggestions on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a picture or take a video under the water, there are a number of options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof sink, for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, for example, GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for approximately $300.
I took these photos at a family holiday with a couple of cameras, all at a cost of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules need to be observed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure the battery cells and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you're going to take.
Some cameras have imaging modes or object type that optimize exposure for cloudy underwater conditions.
Before jumping into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 feet or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's leadership and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few of your staff off because many of them won't make it.
The pets have RCDs that will help you compose the photos, while the emergency camera usually doesn't have them.
Even if you have a RCD, it's gonna be hard to see under the water, and you're going to have a random process.
So make a few of your staff.
Also, if your camera has a serial imaging mode that takes away a few staff with a few different exposure facilities, use it.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly lower than the depths you dive under.
If possible, stay off the surface when you take off in the pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to pass more color on photos; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Swim closer to the sightseeing facilities.
It's a great advice to take a picture on land, but it's even more important under water because of dark light conditions.
Especially important if you film an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to approach the images if you want to fill the frame.
The bronze prize of the 2012 Olympic Games for the free fight of Bilal Mahov can go to the Greek-Roman fight.
This was reported by the main coach of the Dagestan Assembly on the free struggle of Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of an athlete at the Tashkent World Cup in September 2014.
Bilal Mahov is currently in the collection of the "classes" team, which reads "R- Sport" by Sachak Sažidova.
In general, Bilal also performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he was the winner of a wolf tournament and a third prize in the Greek-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on free fighting.
Talked a long time ago that a new stage of our career would be held in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can go to the Tashkent Peace Championship if he wins the show.
But it's always a crucial word for coaching headquarters in the head with Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose strength could have come around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
An anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to rid the sick of both the sufferings of the disease and the sufferings of the treatment.
Among those who spoke to him, his wife recalls, was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors were involved in diagnosis and illness, those undergoing treatment were mainly concerned about something else — pain.
One day in 2007, however, he became one of those who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting flu-like symptoms, he found that he irritated his wife, Juliette.
"I want things to happen faster than later," he remarked.
When Juliette left for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusually and incomprehensible about why he was upset.
Something went wrong.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he was riding skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came in.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers suffer from lung cancer, such as those with lung cancer.
But with a mesothelioma different.
In almost every case, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fiber-based building material once called "miracle," but now known as lethally dangerous.
For most of us, the mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only individuals from specific industries worked closely with it: pipelines, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
But that's not the peace of mind.
Britain, it turns out, is at the peak of the Mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease than from automobile accidents.
Annual Mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future British deaths
The reason why we feel its fatal consequences now is that while asbestos use has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999), mesotelimos tend to go to development for decades.
And the Mesothelioma attack is not limited to veterans of industrial engineering.
Asbestos was, and in many cases, he remains in the house where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, the mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of wealth, profession, or age.
The Bastions of Election, from the fashionable University of London to private schools, have proved to be unsalving.
Parliament's building has been infiltrated by asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have become reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a tube isolater.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have made contact with asbestos.
Then he got it.
“It seems that there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at the Gaia hospital, where I spent six years interning,” he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and trucks used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers are going to get the same disease?
It was a question that, unfortunately, he could have given a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who have been interned in the Gaia hospital who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years”, he said in a letter in 2010, “I have one who is still alive”.
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with "Mesothelioma" when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It's so unusual to live that long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always dead.
So now we can only ask Lawson again, "How many of us are going to get the same disease?"
According to Britain’s leading mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pito, it is likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain must survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most of them don't know they're gonna die that way right now.
asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alami
A quick examination of reports from court halls, where victims are often asked for compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma has been attacked.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen had been contacted with asbestos.
She worked on a network of nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running the clothing departments on two sites, one of which was the main store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at the M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before that happened," she said, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't think of it that would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word “asbestiform”, which means a fibre structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotill, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in the blood vessels, in the hectic plate, the thermal insulation of pipes, the metal sleeves, even in car brakes.
He is less moderate than other forms of asbestos, but he is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of harm to health” that could lead to death.
More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (amositis) and blue asbestos (krokidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts assume that “there are substantial, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain]”.
Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the company's main store in Oxford Street, London Alami
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito’s work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known impact on work or home, was most likely caused by asbestos from the environment”.
Most of this impact, he says, is due to the “normal use and impact of the weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which addressed the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even at the heart of the Government, could be exposed unknowingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committee premises had been contaminated by asbestos, whose fatal fibers could be caused by something as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although the Parliament's Technical Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a clean sanitary certificate, it now recognized that it was necessary to work £1 billion on the reconstruction of Parliament by improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that, after the 2015 general elections, the members of Parliament might be sitting in the QE2 conference centre near and not on the Westminster Green Houses.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation has not been governed by various rules”.
It is not possible to know whether this control error will cost lives.
All you can do right now is wait.
One who has never been able to detect contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, he suspected that he had been exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital that has been successfully sued for asbestos," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and the dates.
That he remembers clearly, that's the day early in December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late at night.
Suddenly, I was feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make it all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the shells around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect the mesothelioma.
After all, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Riding doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was involved in sports and heavy breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to his home with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with “mesoteloma”.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
Eventually, his patient was ten years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The relationship in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor's consultant showed his C.T. results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Ebbott began to feel bad, a sensor equipped with a camera was introduced into a half-way between his chest shell and his light shell.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came a week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Ebbott: diagnosed mesothelioma
Suddenly, Ebbott went into contact with the nurses of Macmillan, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos insulation on pipes was quite common," he said.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, the mesothelioma is now striking young people with untypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be injured.
But many staff members who walked through the tunnels to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as Graham Ebbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For several decades after the war, hospitals have proved to be a place where, theoretically, they have saved lives for the patients, but a place that has threatened the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos linings
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of its amazing insulating and fireproof characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely for the first time exposed to asbestos in class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos pads.
Websites have emerged that draw attention to the problem of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, such harmless things as the barbed tile or the roof of the locusts tended to contain asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison planted in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer representing Andrew Lawson in a case against Gaia Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful with the gardening locusts.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"To realize this, it takes quite a while," said Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to a patient.
As an countless number of patients before him, he remembers being beaten with as much information as he needed to receive.
"It was difficult to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'll never see Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it's the mechanics of how we support life -- the act of breathing itself -- that causes the cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers inhale, it can be stuck in a pleura, a web of light.
The asbestos fiber is irritated by the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises because of the inhalation of the yellowish asbestos fibers,” Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Gaia Hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital, where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now by the irony of the fate of the mesothelioma center.
Trevor knew Lawson and treated some others who might have been affected by an internship at the hospital.
When asbestos needles fall into the tissues of the lungs, says Trager, “the breath pushes them to the periphery where the shell is located.
This is, in fact, an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatments for other cancers are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes heated disputes.
Some people think it's worth a shot.
Coach doesn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut a pleura," he said.
It's impossible to get around her with a knife.
However, this cancer “is not very good at chemotherapy”, which “acts, ” but it does not cure.
"Sometimes there are patients who live a long time," says Trevor.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became sick with mesothelioma, Ebbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis was made, became the office of support and consultation for the same patients.
"Allo, Rakova Central," he spoke cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
First, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months to prolong his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "smart to give the whole thing some more positive paint."
After meeting with several specialists, Ebbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazdownski, professor of thoracic surgery at Gaia Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a lead, I just called them, and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to get funding guidance and approval.
Money plays a crucial role for mesothelioma patients to obtain the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is inevitably ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern — the future of the families they leave behind.
Then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small quantities could have put health at risk.
That's when they talked about the company's bad faith.
Andrew Lawson and the Gaius Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a full-value settlement, according to Morgan, because Lawson was unable to clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at the Gaia hospital.
After investigating his death, the representative of the Gaia Hospital confirmed, however, that “asbestos in the basement premises referred to had been removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, attaching fatal contact with asbestos to one company or workplace - usually decades later - has proved to be a major problem for patients with mesothelioma requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers changed the owner or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who are protected from lawsuits know that there is no time on their side for the plaintiffs.
This year ' s response was followed by major new legislation that facilitates the recovery of compensation for the sick with mesothelioma, even if their former employers could not be monitored.
Under the Act, a £350 million fund was established for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but who could not be tried.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court would be able to award in the normal case of compensation, about £120000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by insurers," he says, implying that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if they hadn't interfered with the temporary interval and the sick with the mesothelioma would have been able to track the companies and file a simple claim.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “incomplete”.
However, Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and they need help today," Penning said during Bill's second reading of the mesothelioma last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Lang-Lazdownsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdownski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy treatment in which Lange-Lazdownski could boast of an entire 40 per cent of the surviving patients in five years.
Ebbott felt a rush of strength.
"This is certainly one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it with patients all the time.
There's some kind of power that supports you.
When you surrender, your condition may deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott went to surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The subsequent scans showed no sign of illness.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And then Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things -- financials, when I die, for example, or what you have to show your wife how a timer works on a boiler.
When you get bad news, you get unhappy.
We have to look ahead.
Like Father Ellie, 16 years old, and Temzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I wouldn't live to age.
They reacted very differently.
Temzin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls real quick.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Talking like this is something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for those with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced with hope, even with the prospect of survival.
This disease brings with it (even after all, to Stephen Jay Guld) a grim certainty.
Andrew Morgan says that "mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are becoming asbestos tissues.

No compensation is paid.
During the Second World War, a shipbuilding, one of the most lethally dangerous professions in terms of contact with asbestos, was developing intensively.
Voluntary Industrial Ban on Blue asbestos Imports
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim of health damage caused by contact with asbestos in Britain.
The global production of asbestos grows to more than 4213,000 tons a year.
Britain imports 139000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Security in Britain requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
Imports and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in Britain.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in Britain.
The compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
Global production is about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protestors swear revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
This is likely to trigger long-promote protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists started planning and mobilizing within hours of the statement.
The decision of the National People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"This has not deceived our expectations, but it is still making us angry," said lawmaker Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's people.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that it would be too chaotic to allow the popular election of the head of Hong Kong.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to choose the Head of Government, beginning in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision adopted on Sunday as a democratic step forward, since it gave Hong Kong the right to direct voting; however, the decision also made it clear that the Chinese leaders would continue to hold the process firmly in their hands by means of a commission for the nomination of candidates strictly controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was taken after summer, when one of the largest and most widely protested in Hong Kong had been held over many years.
For a large part of the democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to cover Hong Kong's financial area if Beijing did not guarantee the present universal electoral right.
On Sunday evening, hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain before the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving towards a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise at the wave of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In the online statement, the organizers said that the movement " contemplated the possibility of taking the central area only as an exceptional measure, actions that could be taken only if all possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
We are very sorry to report that, to date, all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong prepared for Beijing's statement for several days, and security measures involving police and barricads were strengthened at government headquarters on Sunday.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Inflows from the mainland increase competition in goods and services.
There is also growing fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put business -- the source of Hong Kong's life force -- at risk.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate and how long," said the legislator, Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We don't want to worry about Hong Kong getting out of control.
This is a perception that is harmful to investment.
The Chinese public media have also reported in recent days, in which Hong Kong democratic activists have been shown to be divers by Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
American culture of prom goes to university life: first-year students are invited to come on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the first "lux" travel service in Britain for current students.
In order to leave a vivid impression of coming to university, the company also offers options such as passenger aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service thought of security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
The company representative said that since the service had just been launched, no orders had yet been received, but added that “students will start ordering this service within the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that, despite the fact that students have to pay £9900 per year for training, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
The current students are quite different from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hope: more important than ever, to make an excellent first impression, and the VIF is exactly what it takes.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students criticized this service as being detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NSS of Higher Education, said: "This project seems to be incredibly alienated from the lives of most students.
Many students who start their studies at university this month face a cost-of-living crisis when available financial support in the form of credits and grants fails to meet the rapidly rising cost of basic needs before they can even begin to think of spending thousands of pounds on something like just coming to a dormitory.
Feminists raise the issue of race and behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed boy was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
They raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot" while they're waiting in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in Internet conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put a gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Peres saw the responses of white women who focused 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal essays with titles such as “the thoughts of Ferguson from a white woman” and “Feminism is not only about the oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they have shown significant progress.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about the white colour of skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so attached to race, they felt that they needed to point it out.
For English professor at Ohio University of Korea, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems black Americans face every day but are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'm going to get 150 swears from all over," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how color people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between issues relating to race and gender.
In her view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face complex realities every day.
While white women are now combining race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
“White women were lynched between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men, and this was almost always based on rape by a white woman," Hatter said.
It took a white woman to corroborate the story to justify lynching.
In Hatter's view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and found that the struggle for electoral law would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
“They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for black people was to appear later”, Hattie said.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching at the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
This group appeared nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From the point of view of Mitchell, raising the response of white feminists to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when the white feminists had to “take away” the problems that black women faced in several generations.
“Truly, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology were equally serious about the right to raise a child as they relate to the right to contraception?” Mitchell asked.
The second wave of feminists who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives is now beginning to understand what that means.
A prominent white activist of the feminist movement, Gloria Steinem, used Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's murder and published a sharp article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, a columnist who demanded that white Americans take more part in racist protests.
“I hope that women with different but similar reasons for understanding the risk of the body - and the view of racial problems that are significantly different in public surveys - will be at the head of change”, Stein wrote.
Although Steinem is in charge of more intersecting feminism, which includes racial issues and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
Researcher Christine Summers of the American Business Institute, author of "Who Stealed Feminism?" She said that young men in the United States, especially colourful young people, are "more vulnerable than their sisters", but the Stein trailers about Ferguson contradicted the criticism she had expressed earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “Train my brother” to help vulnerable black and Spanish - speaking youths followed an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police relationship with the black community is not the only problem that promotes the forward line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested about 63,000 minors without escorting the country ' s south-west border this year, immigration reform has surfaced again, this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chair of We Belong Together, an organization that would mobilize women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the problem as important to women, she had only had to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of working visas are issued to [immigrants], women who come with them are placed in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a response from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswicz house with pigs sold
The photo of the house on sale in Saffolka was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that there was a large pig resting in the living room.
Sold for £120000, a single house with one bedroom stands on the private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was given by a photo of the living room of the house, on which a pig with a head rested on the couch.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo was the pet owner of the house.
“However, the photograph has been placed by mistake and has already been removed”, said the company representative.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former congregation home as “a unique one-bedroom home”.
Although the agency removed the photograph from its website, it was still in advertising material.
The sale of the house has aroused interest in social networks where some have asked whether pigs are sold together with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the match of the fourth round of the US Open, assigned Carolyn Wozniacka, believes she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wishes to complete the year with dignity and to try to move to a new level, passing on Vasily OSIPO from New York.
How do you generally rate your results at the Big helmet tournament this year?
Of course, I'm glad you managed to win the Rollan Garros.
As for the three other tournaments, I lacked stability, especially in the limbs of some of the matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
She couldn't even make it to the quarterfinals.
What tasks do you have up to the end of the season?
After the injury, I have a huge motivation to get to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to complete the year with dignity.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a few weeks.
Member of the Gosduma Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth Affairs, former peace champion Nikolay Waluev suggested that the GTO rules should be awarded bonuses upon entry into ties.
He said that, in general, standards would be the same as in Soviet times - people would pass on rules for pulling, running and other exercises.
To remind you, 12 entities of Russia will start implementing the WTO rules from 1 September in their territory.
I also offered to the schoolchildren who gave up the TTO, to give bonuses when they entered the university, said Valway.
For example, you can add some points to the EEG.
There are proposals to provide additional exit workers of enterprises who have undergone the sport tests.
A new billionaire appeared in the city of Harvey in South Wales after winning a lottery.
A game in a Harvey lottery this month.
There is a search for a new billionaire in the south-west of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday night.
The paper bag at Harvey brings gold to the main prize for the second time in five years, the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to be declared.
The owner of Steve Forvard's bench said that the winnings caused a ripple in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city's talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought a win like that might be a secret.
Eight Western Australian winners celebrated the winning of the main prize last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a game from Kanning Wail was one of five million in August, following a huge $7.5 million win from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and said that winnings gave them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new house.
A billionaire from Harvey is bringing the number of winners of the main prize in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Microeconomic development wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
This week, the Mini-economic development will bring an integrated plan for the development of clean transport in Russia to the Government, told the director of the department of the Ministry of Oleg Pluzhnikov on a round table held by the News on the Moscow Motorway, 2014.
The plan is based on the Government ' s mandate, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September - early October, the Pillows said, the proposed measures are related to electric vehicles and hybrids, and there is already a plan for the development of vehicles on gas fuel in Russia.
The plan (copy of the news) is for 2014-2017.
The criteria for assessing electric and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to promote the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
The report of the Government, which will describe the tax and customs measures in support of electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the concessional lending and concessional leasing scheme will be in place by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the cost of vehicles, stimulating localization and establishing service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is proposed to amend legislation to facilitate the construction of charge infrastructure (in parkings, car filling stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities in 2015 to encourage the use of environmentally sound transport in the form of advantages in movement and parking, for example; and, by February 2016, proposals to increase the purchase of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the mini-economic development of regional authorities will provide a list of indicators for assessing the performance of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport, the development of charge infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is only established in 2013 and around 100 electric vehicles have been sold throughout the country.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was renewed, so sales would be about 500 grand, predicting the chief executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
But five-fold growth does not make the electric vehicles any visible: in 2013, according to the Association of European Business, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors is imported into Russia.
The Renault Company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says the Director for Strategic Planning and Partnerships Renault in Russia, Nikola Remiz.
Most other producers of electrical transport, however, took a stand against Russia.
The development of electric vehicles is also carried out by Russian producers - “”, GAZA, “”, but it is a poor production.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AutoWAZ released 30 electric cars.
The demand for low-cost electric vehicles recognizes the Director of AutoWAZ Engineering Sergei Amanov, without a dominant breakthrough in this segment....
The development of the Russian electricity market in addition to the expensive car (these electric cars sold in Russia, on average twice as much as domestic combustion engines) inhibits the underdevelopment of the charge infrastructure (fuels - units) by Sergey Celikov, CEO of Autostata.
As a result of the costly and low rate of lowering the cost of the electric vehicle in the next 3-4 years, the niche segment of the Russian market will remain, predicts Michael Pokolerski's main editor-in-chief, and is agreed with it.
On the contrary, manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional vehicles.
In Russia's electricity market, good prospects, the main thing is to reassure consumers that "electricity" is real; this will, in particular, contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, underlines the president of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by the Rosseti Goscompany: several stations are being built in Moscow, and there will soon be about 80 more.
Negotiations are under way for the construction of a network of fillings with other regions.
According to the director of the Rossetei department, Vladimir Sofiin, the company believes in the market for electric cars and is prepared to build a gas station throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of various brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, is not entitled to sell electricity, and there is an opportunity to do so with regard to the charging of electric vehicles.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of leadership in the creation of the electricity market in Russia to be the overthrow of customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, extending the concessional list is being developed.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and concerns all vehicles) will also support the market, but it is not as clear as customs preferences, according to Pankov.
A small transport tax in Russia, Pankov said, in contrast to Norway, for example, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric vehicles, now accounting for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, there is also a need for stimulating measures for auto owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as already done in Moscow), confident Pankov, or the possibility of electric vehicles moving by poles, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado
Piper PA-46 crashed into the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three out of five people in it died, passing over ITAR TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred several kilometres from the Denver airport runway.
The causes of the tragedy are now being identified.
In Donetsk, they're dealing with prisoners of the Donbass Battalion.
The caravans were surrounded by Ilowaysk.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of violent men were killed under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in the south-east of Ukraine really was, they would not have gone to war.
108 prisoners can be described as lucky.
The Donbass Battalion are alive after the masquerades they got into under Iloway.
In the Donetsk People's Republic of the Army, militants spent several days, in fact, abandoned by their commanders and Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from headquarters that a column could be moved out of the allegedly provided corridor.
But just a few minutes from now, the shells and bullets are on all sides.
"The judge on the information that I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed out," he says, "and the deputy battalion commander with the Lermonts calling."
And when we went down between the Multipola and the Chervonoselles, we started a crossfire from antitank-controlled rockets, from the shells, grenade launchers, 30-millimeter, BMD automatic rifles, small arms.
I had four cars ahead of me and three cars behind me, and there were only two cars left.
The Lermont officer relates: nearly immediately, at least 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, many died after.
The survivors are now receiving medical assistance from those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that so-called “terrorists” treat them well, give them food, medicines.
At a time when their own commanders had actually deceived them and condemned them to death.
They just betrayed us, they say.
The Colony, the whole battalion, to destroy it.
At the Donbass Battalion, like many of his associates, Alexey volunteered for the atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east of the separatists in Ukrainian news.
Alexey had already seen a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me and told me that a mortar fire was coming, that it's probably the Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Alexey.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
We weren't released from Ilowaysk, they said we were in a ring.
I've already made a deal with the commander, and I've already written a report on my resignation.
We were taken to Ilowaysk from the Zeruhovo Congregation.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the boiler under Iloway.
Now some survivors admit that if time could be reversed, they would not have entered the penal battalion for anything.
All prisoners were handed over to the DNR forces.
Each person is tested for involvement in war crimes.
A food price limitation headquarters has been established in the region.
The Krasnoyar region has established a headquarters which will limit, where necessary, the rise in the prices of products in the region's market.
The order to establish this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the Government of the province, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the province.
Will Kiev's Rosnefti pay $140 million in losses?
President Rusnefti Igor Sechin stated that the company assessed the damage from the shooting of the Lisic NPZ in Ukraine in $140 million.
He reported this in an interview with Spiegel.
“We are estimated at $140 million in damages and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation,” said Sechin.
According to him, the operation of the upgraded Lisic NPZ was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no battles, there were no dignitaries, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, there was a loss of technology oil in the pipes," he said.
Recall that on 18 July, in connection with the shooting of the Lisic NPZ, the oil storage tank burned down and the two warehouses destroyed.
The Lisic NPC, the main oil refinery in Ukraine, was first introduced into the plant in October 1976.
The total capacity of the LCI is about 7 million tons of crude oil per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro-4 fuel, as well as a batch of Euro-5.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisic NNP was suspended due to its disposal.
The company decided to start repairs.
In a year, Rosneft received the LDC along with other Ukrainian TNC-XP assets.
The DPRK launched a low range projectile towards the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this occurred about 10:30 a.m. local time on the side of Chagando Province, located on the border of North Korea and China.
As Interfax was reported in the Joint Committee of South Korean Headquarters, the rocket allegedly fell into the Japanese Sea after it had flown some 220 kilometres.
Rubble falls in the background of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar was raised by 3 cops to 37.15 rubs, and the ruble fell to a ballot basket amid geopolitical tensions.
Trade in ETCs by dollar started transactions within the limits of 37,11-37,2 rub./$1, at an average rate of 37,16 rub./$1, for two minutes above the level of the previous closure.
The euro was 48.79 rub. per euro, 3 copies above the level of the previous closure.
The price of the household basket was added to 3.5 copies and amounted to 42.395 rubs.
The US dollar is traded at 23 copies above the official course, the euro at 16 copies above the official course.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued to be cheap and ruble and even restored his historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now already pre-emerging the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
So far, however, it's more like an artificial exclamation through the media, especially Western ones.
Options for new sanctions to be imposed on the RF are not many.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, rubl continues to be severely weakened against the buffalo basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, unless we see new negatives in the near future, Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will be tried with Ideal Tour
The Orenburg Airlines have submitted a total of 4.7 billion rubles to Ideal Tour.
These are two cases on which meetings will be held in October.
There will be different judges to deal with the cases.
According to Interfax, the first action was brought on 14 August.
It's a little over 425 million roubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 7 October.
The second statement was made on 18 August.
It's 4.24 billion roubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union, different judges have been appointed.
In July, the media reported the debts of the Ideal Tour to the Orenburg Airlines in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
The Air Director, Victor Zukin, speaks of an amount of 1.6 billion roubles.
The CEO of Aeroflot, Vitaly Saulev, calls it two billion roubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting to new users
The microblog service has changed the user registration process to involve new participants more quickly in active collaboration with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have left their microbials.
New Twitter users will now be looking at a large number of receipts recommended by the service to immediately compile their readings.
Recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration process.
However, Twitter automatically puts a check mark on the subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
As a result, the user will have to take off his own hands so that he does not read those who are not interested.
If the microblogging service users had previously seen only the adversaries of recommended users, then Twitter is now taking out a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help make an impression on the person.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration page over the past three years.
Recently, Twitter has been active in modernizing the service.
This activity is primarily related to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve a senseless reality.
In 2014, microblogging services experienced a slowdown in user base growth and a fall in readership.
At this point, the company desperately needs more loyal consumer resources, which, once again, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a steady flow of advertising.
A Day of Knowledge in Moscow Will Be Warm and Rainy
The first September in the Moscow region will be cold and rainy throughout the day, reporting meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will range from 16 to 18 degrees, in Podmoskovye, from 13 to 18 degrees.
In cloudy and clear weather, rain will pass, and the east quarter wind will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
Vehicle disposal programme resumed from 1 September
Since 1 September, a car disposal programme has been resumed in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles would be allocated for this purpose.
As explained by Head Minpromtorga RF Denis Mantourov, money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redeployment from other areas of support.
The program touches all cars over the age of six.
The amount of compensation will be between 40,000 for an easy car and 350,000 roubles per truck.
A similar vehicle recycling program had already been in place in Russia.
The main difference in the current project was explained by the Minister that it is now envisaged not only for the disposal of vehicles to obtain a subsequent discount, but also for the possibility, if the vehicle reaches over six years of age, to acquire a new discount when an old person is transferred to a dealer by Interfax.
Over 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal recycling programme, which operated from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million (this plus 101.4 per cent compared to 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator will play a game about contemporary journalism
The gamemaker, Nikki Case, famous for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game of contemporary journalism.
He told me about his project in the Kill Screen interview.
Kace started working on the game a few weeks ago, but the fact was now widely known.
The games were inspired by what happened in Ferguson, where protests began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be how information about history affects their effects.
A hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population occur.
The hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes, and the protesters as bandits, the police will start treating him better and putting him where the normal man can't go.
If he highlights events differently, his photographs can turn peaceful protests into a massive rebellion.
The points in the game will have to be picked with a tweeter of a hero in which new subscribers will appear if the photographs presented there become popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The date of exit and the platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Kace, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photograph was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Case, he explained that he had been considering the concept of such a game for quite a long time, but originally wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the United States but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began gathering material for the game, the gamemaker realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to highlight the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media highlight the events in Ferguson, he decided to play the game on the grounds of what had happened.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who issues browser games.
The most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which describes events in the biography of Casey himself, focuses on how a bisexual youth tries to tell their relationships to homophobic parents.
Heleté engages Ukraine in the continuation of bloodshed
The call to prepare for another “tens of thousands” of victims by Ukraine's Minister of Defence Valérie Ghelletaj engages the people in a continuing bloody confrontation, as stated in the report by the Ministry of Defence.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the comments made by the head of the Ukrainian military agency Valeria Geletea, who claimed “to complete an operation to liberate the east of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great National War”, which would result in “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military department, who published the post on his Facebook page, is the subject for the study of non-military specialists”, said the Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On its Facebook page, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has already threatened several times on informal channels that if the resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
In doing so, he stated that “the operation for the liberation of the east of Ukraine” had been completed.
Through Hilton removed all the intimate photos of the stars and apologized.
Today, the horror has spread to over 60 Hollywood stars.
The hackers hacked primitive passwords into the iCloud (data repository) in smartphones, and then their intimate photos appeared on the blogging site of Perez Hilton.
True, for a little while.
Remember, the official of the Star Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence, has already reported on the theft of photographs from her mobile phone, and has confirmed that all the photos that "sail" in the Network are real.
Through Hilton, the one-named tabloid creator, apologized to the actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their frank pictures, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I wasn't contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to remove the frank photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," a blogger on Twitter wrote.
However, all the frank photographs of the stars have already spread over the Web.

This happened in Los Angeles on the turn of the Sunset Boulevard.
A British football player has been cut and spread his right hand.
Beckham got out of the saloon tattoo, where he was put by the paparazzi.

As a result, Beckham received a bruise, a sprain of his right hand, and a scratch.
Tony Stuart suffers from an accident on his way back to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track has already ended a little more than in the middle of the race on Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stuart crashed into the wall the second time his right front tire broke down in 172 laps, putting an end to his performance.
Stuart drove his car to the garage and then left without talking to reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that 14 members of the team were upset, but now they focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond, and hopefully we'll get better there.
Stuart first crashed into the wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repairing the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty good hope of getting to the finish," said Johnson, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart’s car was loaded on the evac, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cups after his car crashed and killed another driver during a race on the ground track in the north of New York State.
He decided to come back this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or at the following races in Richmond to participate in the Persecution.
He returned to work during an investigation into a tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had taken the route to express displeasure with Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
No decision was taken on whether Stuart would be charged.
The three - time champion was greeted with loud shouts and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting from the 12th position, Stuart walked in the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then it's 122 laps after Bush's reboot.
Car 18 went off the track at the exit of turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart has moved on, but he's back to 21st position.
Sobczak and Whithan eat cigarettes with Zvanackim in Odessa
Xenia Sobcak and Maksim Witorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV conductor has not passed on to his Instagram.
True, one photograph surprised and saddened the couple’s worshipers.
It's taken in Zvanetsko.
"At breakfast with Mikhail Mikhalych Zvanacki Maxim explains what is an instagram:) #odessa" signed a photograph of Xenia Sobcak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter, no more...
The couple decided that Ksusha was a smoker, and they condemned her for it.
"And the cigarettes of whose? "Smoking Kills!", "Some cigarette breakfast?", "It's like breakfast and only cigarettes on the table?"))) ", "Psenia, do you smoke too?", were excited for your favorite subscriber to her blog.
To remind you, Sobczak recently boasted of what a delicious meal Max Vitorgan had prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happy is it when you come to the cottage and your husband has prepared a meal for you to come, and for the first time for your marriage, it is so delicious."The main thing is that at the end of the dinner he would not say to the words of the anecdote, "that it is so now every day," she boasted with her husband, Xenia Sobczak.
The picture shows that the Maximus is making a lot of work, and the salt and roasted chicken are already on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia's capital.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to return to the former working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Increases in salaries are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
Within a month, the officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new schedule of work, requiring the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of prison officials has met several times with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement has been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations continue, the BNR reported to the Head of the Directorate-General for the Execution of the Sentences of Rosen Zelazkov.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to protest the union of prison officials.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed Vongsuwana (left) Minister of Defence
The military ruler and the Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prait Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers, in which more than one third of the posts are held by generals or generals in resignation.
The army has received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praít Chan-Ocha was approved as Prime Minister after the King of Thailand formally approved the appointment of the Head of the Interim Military Government to the post.
A 60-year-old military, who had taken over power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on 22 May, was the only candidate for the Prime Minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed MPs.
According to Prajat Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by a six-month demonstration, during which protestors demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Officially Praít Chan-Ocha will be the interim prime minister, as the military plans to hold a general election at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to strengthen their authority in the country.
Military came to power on 22 May
against the background of the complete paralytic of civil power.
Leaders of major political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they arrested the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army settled with Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Taksin as Prime Minister.
Both enjoy the popularity of the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has often led to their success in the elections.
However, many middle class and capital elite representatives have entered the anti-government movement, which has almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one ever said it would be better in the media salad, and I didn't promise you that, and the waiter in Palm's new bra.
We have to formally admit that this is the case, but the mind and the stomach remain unfavorable.
We say "Belgium" -- we mean media -- we say "media" -- we mean "Belgium."
Restaurants like to state in depth that the success of the facility depends on three factors: location, location and location.
There are places that don't fit well, not even excellent, but some unlucky ones.
In short, when I sat down at Palm's table, I remembered that there was once a town's cafe (in honor of the same TV show), then Odessa Mama, and also a Bogole restaurant and a beer company.
Now it's beer again, but it's not nostalgic-Soviet, it's Belgian.
On the ground, only the tip of the iceberg — a bar stand and a couple of tables — was removed from the rest of the space even from the sun.
But it's fun here, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful stools, instead of windows, the TVs where girls swim.
Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg have long been off the grid, so to compare them with something.
There are eight types of spilled beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and countless number of bottled bottles (170-1550 rubles).
A company-positive waiter presents the menu cheerfully, saying that “media are big seeds” and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected for content, but often very unexpectedly.
Well, for example, who was told that meat roulette with vallon black (280 roubles) was actually a carpathic, cut to the same thin, that the parchment paper compared to it would appear to be unbecoming fat.
It's only possible to taste anything if you fold a polterrel together.
It's worse with salads.
The classic ligature (260) would be the best thing to recognize as a crime against the Belgian people: some creepy iceberg once opened a long time ago, a sour Kenyan beans, bean chips, plus a marinated onions.
You don't want to meet anyone with a salad like that!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If it was still possible to close the eyes of the immature quarters of the reeds or the overheated champagnes, why do the mussels look as if they had managed to freeze and open them several times in their lives!
I already know that there are quite normal Belarusian mussels here!
They are served in rolls "in sauce for your choice" (490-560 roubles per 0.5 kg).
The sauce of half a dozen, that of white wine, celery, and carrots, was not openly asked.
There are fruits, and there is no aroma, whether there was wine or not, and that remains a mystery.
But they're good midget fries with homemade mayonnaise.
The chicken water here is not a sponge, thick to the point that depending on the mood, you can decide whether the first or the second dish is in front of you, but just a nice plum soup.
The rabbit was said to be cooking in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the back, the situation was diametrically the opposite: rosmarine silenced everything.
It seemed that the rabbit was fed exclusively with marshmallows, which resulted in such unusual flavors of meat.
But with the rabbit attached to the leg, it's not, it's just a reddish pea in a caramelised crust.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also lean, beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was an excess of water, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager at the table was very informally interested in the lunch impressions.
So you should come again.
The dollar exchange rate rose above 37 rubles on news of new sanctions in the West against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar for tomorrow by 10:29 msk rose by 26.9 copies and was 37.02 roubles, the euro rose by 30 copies - up to 48.73 rubles, according to data from the Moscow Exchange.
The basket grew 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and cost 42,28 rubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum of 19 February 2009 — it cost 36.43 rubles and it was already 37,005 roubles on 3 March 2014.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that President Barack Obama and Chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the rubble is long-term, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast meant this, says Senior Alpari analyst Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in courses in any way.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, rumors about the military invasion have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the talk about him being resistant to such news was blocked yesterday.
The week is estimated to close around those levels - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period has ended, oil prices are weak, policy, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine, all of which are chain bonds.
The inflation rate is also projected: between 5 and 10 per cent will be added to current prices for autumn.
Soon, too, seasonal vegetables and fruits will end, and some vacuum will come when the networks are redirected to other suppliers.
"Dollar came to the mark in 37 rubles, passed it and returned, some powerful hype is missing," commented the head of Market Analysis Division "Open Broker" Konstantin Bushiev.
They will still see whether they will introduce the promised sanctions on Saturday as NATO meets.
Rubble, he said, was severely weakened after the tax season ended, then sent news to Ukraine, and last week, the CB stated that by the end of the year, it had completely moved to a floating course and refused any exchange intervention.
Looking at the day-to-day fluctuations, it was no different from the previous month, and it scared the 37 roubles, and the analyst continues.
And so, nothing powerful happened in terms of turnover.
The alarming times for the currency market were, as I recall, when the increased demand for currency was noted at the end of January, as well as the third of March, when the CB shipped a record number of currencies.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the rubble weakening.
First of all, this is an increase in the revenue part of the export budget, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through import travel, says UFS IC chief analyst Alexey Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services can be considered negative.
Russian currency fluctuations significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, stimulate inflationary pressures and, as a result, lead to the cost of borrowing, which, in turn, hinders the development of the country's economy.
In terms of the stock market, the underestimation of the rubble slightly smoothes down the share prices expressed in the rubles.
For example, the MBIB index fell by 1.67 per cent in the Thursday trades, and the RTS index lost 3.27 per cent.
The significant difference in the relative decline in indices is due to a reduction of more than 1.5 per cent during the day.
The weakening of the rubble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy a currency.
As practice shows, emotions are gradually disappearing and rubles are partially or completely restoring lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency to the level of 36 rubles per dollar," notes Alexi Kozlov.
Genetic impairment is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Caryn Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years left to live after she had diagnosed another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Mari-Tuta (MMT), a group of hereditary disorders that caused nerve damage outside her brain and spinal cord.
The charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis was a common problem among people with CMT, because so little is known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are suspected of having CMTs that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, untrustworthy walking, and tightened toes.
The sick may feel numb or pain, and the condition is not healed and progressed, which means that the symptoms are increasing over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought that she was suffering from the Friedrich (AF) attack, a condition that was very bad for her.
Rogers thought she'd be nailed to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, said, "I knew as a child that I couldn't do what the others did.
I fell every day, and I had more time for everything.
I could never ride roller skateboards or skateboards with other kids, and I had a lot of fun at school because of my walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release Achilles' tendon and straighten out her feet, she looked into the medical card when her doctor left the room, and it said that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I stuck my nose where I shouldn't go, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote to the Association of AF," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and I was in the most terrible panic that I could.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair in 18 and I'd die before I turned 25, and I'd gradually lose all my abilities in this space.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After a few genetic tests, she was found with CMT.
"When he explained what the shmt was, I thought I pulled a lucky ticket," she said.
The British CMT charity announced a month of information on CMTs to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on business in the Washington Zone grows as the economy recovers.
The emerging economy means more customers, more sales and more jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The State and local tax bills for companies across the country have increased moderately in the past year, as economic recovery has accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone are no exception.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totaled $27.6 billion in the state and local levels in the financial year 2013, by 3.8 per cent more than the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The State and local business tax burden increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the years that followed, when the accounts were reduced, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 per cent, is taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax income is paid by firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, produces the lowest tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the rise in tax revenue is due to a return to the continued value of real estate, according to researchers, raising real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when growth was less than 1 per cent.
While a large proportion of these revenues are from large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totaled $10 billion in taxes on real estate in the state and at the local level last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - up 4.2 per cent, compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate does not have a similar effect on the growth of State and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one fifth of the company's tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half the state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
“What happens in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the fiscal base around the Columbia District, is owned by the Government or by a non-profit organization that does not pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs could not fully explain the real estate market.
Business revenue also seems to be being adjusted according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion of corporate income tax, most in the region.
Although trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three locations.
The level of growth in the District of Colombia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, there was a rise in tax revenue below the average 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (of which the same corporate rate) was 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is relatively high 9.975 per cent.
A U.S. Chamber of Commerce study appeared earlier this year to show that in Virginia there was a lower tax on state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate for business taxes than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation reducing corporate rates this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring income tax to entrepreneurs up to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington Zone seems to be feeling better and is thus paying more taxes on the state and the local level, according to a recent study.
The taxes on entrepreneurs paid in the form of individual income taxes on owners of small businesses - a transitional structure, which has established the majority of small firms - in Colombia, Maryland and Virginia - increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with much higher growth rates than taxes on entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate tax revenues across the country are likely to persist this year, with taxes on trafficking in state and local governments increasing by 6.2 per cent over the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may be lagging behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of the Russian Judo
The world home championship on judo brought two silver and seven bronze prizes to the collection of Russia.
At this rate, the Russians gave up only the main favorite of the competitions, which is Japan's collection.
A tournament in Chelabinsk was launched on Monday, and the first day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
It was owned by Beslan Mudranov, who was in the category of 60 kg.
At the same time, in the final struggle against Bolbubatar Ganbat of Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was only one observation received by the Russian.
And on the second day of the tournament, the most successful for the collecting Russia, the three medals were won on Tuesday.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg silver was given to Mikhail Pulaev and bronze to Kamalu Khan Magomedov.
In the final team, the Russian surrendered to the 2011 and 2013 World Cup of Japan's Masasi Ebinuma.
Khan Magomedov, who lost his fellow countryman in the fourth final stage, won the tournament and won the bronze prize.
In a women's tournament of up to 52 kg, Natalya Kuzutin also reached the third stage of the Pedestal.
In the semi-finals, she lost the current peace champion, Milinda Kelmendi of Kosovo, who played under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully defended the title.
Although Ma Inan of China won the Couzutin bronze dispute, after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she expected.
And once again, the Russian side of gold was blocked by Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzutina earlier in the European Championship final.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelabinsk Bronze, Moses Moguskov, who fought in the category of 73 kg, was placed in a mine of the collecting Russia.
In the quarter, Victor Skovortsov, a former representative of Moldova, now representing the OAU team, became an offender.
But then the Russian won two fights and became the recipient of the prize.
Mogushkov spoke at the home championship with the trauma of a golenotype that he planned to heal soon, so he would take a break in the competitions.
With regard to Skvortsov's ex-moldvan, he and he reached the bronze medal in this tournament.
It is interesting that another of his compatriots, who took over the UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, with the bronze, completed his statement in the category of up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the PM-2014 also brought the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifotov won up to 81 kg.
In the difficult battle of the small finale, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmitt by commenting with the rival.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were played in the tournament, but the Russian tradition was limited to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Kirill was the owner of the questions, with the Russian medal guaranteed by his rival for the finale being the country's capital, Cyril Denisov.
However, the fight was not fought: the opponent of the Question was unable to get on the dads because of the trauma.
The men's bronze was won by the masters and on the sixth day of the competition, she was placed in a coven by Renata Sayidov, who was in the category over 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he received a pure victory over the Brazilian David Moura.
This has resulted in an individual part of the world ' s championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelabinsk, on Sunday, the world's championships were played in team competitions.
Both Russian and male and female were one of the main contestants, but, as in individual competitions, they were not fortunate enough to get to the medals.
Now, Russian judoists have won command silver.
In a decisive fight against the 2-3 account, they gave way to Japan ' s team, the main favorites of the competition.
At the same time, the total Russia led 2-0 after the net victory of Khan Maghomedov and the duly elected Denisa Yarceva (between 73 kg and 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals, Murat Habavirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope.
In addition, a bronze match developed in a women's tournament, where the Russian team took 2 to 0, giving up to 2 to 3.
President Vladimir Putin attended the Chelyabinske team competitions, who congratulated the silver men's collection after the tournament.
"Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions," said Putin, whose word RIA "New."
To lose to the Japanese, to the judo parents, there's nothing out there.
But I'm sure you can win with them.
Russia's team at the world's home championship was much better than it was a year ago at a similar level in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals, one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstan and Mansur Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximumists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember, if the person in the Olympic cycle is in eight of the strongest, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Even more so in the form of sport such as judo," said Minister of Sport Vitali Mutko, who was given the floor of the champion's press service.
The congregation of Japan was expected to be the best in Chelabinsk, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which were gold.
The next World Cup will take place in the summer of the next year in Astana.
Other materials, news, and statistics are available on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers is unconscious about coming to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that 81-year-old comedian would recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had had had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, reporting sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her under drug control and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “hard to deal with”.
The response was broad, including numerous Internet support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
All will be able to be kings.
The Royal Blood debut album is a new British rock hope that led the rock duets from the clubs to the stadiums.
Duet Royal Blood all year on the stage, but already has a nomination for the BBC music prize, a tour of the Arctic Monkeys warm-up, and a visit to the New York concert dressing room from Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut single album, a few months before the release, received 100,000 pre-orders, and the contract for its release is in the wallet of Major-Leable Warner Music.
In view of the current sad situation in the music market, the situation is not new to Lana Del Ray or to another sweet-spoken representative of the "new R'n'B" but a duet of bulls in the form of British players playing with that level of loudness and intensity, which was last fashioned a couple of decades ago.
In general, the rates for the first album in all of the above circumstances were particularly high and have already been justified.
Duet did not take the name he had previously been able to reach out to, because the desperate metal-haired ones, and the blood of which the kings seem to flow in their veins, too, is understandable.
It is, of course, primarily the characters of the previous Led Zeppelin level: like the great quartet, the Royal Blood set out to invade the established blood of the British rock, bringing it to a new height.
Prognosing the success of this company is probably too early, but something can already be said.
Dozens of songs in thirty minutes are not as much a demonstration of the phenomenal composer's gift as a sure and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the virtues of individual numbers, of course, can't be denied: let's say, the "Out Of The Black" pilot single is characterized by what is remembered, not by a melodic line, but by the drum party.
Musicians in a joke say it's even easier to tap than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful Little Monster and closing the plate of the composition "Better Strangers" with Shakespeare's quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at the heavy - rock lovers’ party, but when they lose, they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And that's not necessarily bad, even the opposite.
The Royal Blood force is that they don't claim to be the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather to the Motörhead successors), but they've pulled a lot of rock duets out of the ghetto indy clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was designed for stadiums, in a space of less than a few thousand people, apparently narrow.
The secret is, in part, the subtle use of the bass that replaced the guitar in the normal format, invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
After all, it is not only in instruments but also in the very way of making songs.
Herophes of zeros were hard to get out of the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance to admit themselves not just epigons but as creative units themselves.
Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and urgent that this effort is successfully scratching some of the secondaryity and tenacity of music material.
After all, who said the rock was supposed to be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion.
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information said on Friday morning: Online store - and video producer, and a hundred other things - buys Twitch stream video service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news was not surprising because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch's Google video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination looked natural.
Twitch, based just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a traffic service of a general nature, the YouTube version in real time.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their internal moments; "YouTube for real-time games", according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of video clips in which the know-it-all (mainly old ones) play a game of machining like in the "Tain Theatre", is already popular on YouTube.
The point is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met with no particular interest, a classic example of an entrenched technology company buying a potential competitor.
It's a secret why a YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from the executive director of Twitch Emmett Shir: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us reach them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who claim to be better at sports than watching them, find it hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking the jocks in their hands.
One thing is to look through a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she crawls through Rezident Evil, and the other thing is to watch some outsider get 20 shots into his head in the Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the view on their own can be a recipe for the headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speeding walks in which the Rogers of the Bannisters of our electronic age complete a record game are entertaining.
But if it's not a game or humor virtuosis, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel would be interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How is Amazon going to make it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch turning to Amazon Instant Video as nicely as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
Yet, Twitch has something that any company would be happy to receive: the crowds of young men whom advertisers dream about.
As head Twitch Shire, Amazon and Twitch said, "they both believe in future games", and this channel does not give signs of seduction, even - oh - like a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, died as a result of the attack in 2004.
Over 800 people were wounded.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
They spoke to the surviving hostages -- almost all of them now -- the students, with the parents of the deceased, with the graveyard viewer, Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the Mother Beslan Committee, Susana Dudieva, who participated in the special operation by a MCS officer -- relates the correspondent of Elizabeth Antonov, who worked on the special project.
After returning to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who was President's adviser on the North Caucasus 10 years ago and engaged in negotiations with terrorists, as well as with the FSB officer of Russia, Vjaceslav Bocharov.
What really startled me during my work on the subject was that there was no such thing as those ten years in Beslan.
This topic is extremely painful for anyone who has anything to do with it, and people find it difficult to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very difficult.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," Antonov said.
The special project was prepared by the Rambler & Co-holding Infographic Studio, which has been working for the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects focused on the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
DPRK launched a small-range missile
North Korea launched a small-range missile into the Japanese sea, reports Renhap.
The launch took place around 10.30 a.m. local time on the side of Chagando Province, on the border of North Korea and China.
The rocket allegedly fell into the Japanese Sea, some 220 kilometres, and was declared in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Deputies suggested speeding up the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, the Russian data will not be stored on servers abroad as from 1 January 2015
A draft law had been introduced in Gosdum to postpone the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislation of the lower chamber.
It was co-sponsored by representatives of Gosduma Vadim Dengin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (the only Russian Federation), Vladimir Parachin (the righteous Russia), and Alexander Yuschenko (CRC).
Such a change would, in the initiative ' s view, contribute to a more speedy and effective enforcement of the rights of RFF citizens to the security of personal data and to the confidentiality of communications networks.
The Act, which hastened the entry into force of parliamentarians, requires that Russian personal data processed via the Internet be kept in the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, store, clarify and extract personal data from citizens of the Russian Federation, in databases located in the territory of Russia, and to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law confers on the Roskomnadzor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of personal data legislation by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called “black lists” of violators' websites, an automated information system entitled “Registration of data subject rights violators”.
This law was passed by the Lord in the summer.
The bill was written by Andrey Lugova and Vadim Dengin of LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of CRC.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also one of the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who do not have the data centres in the RF will have to pay for rent
In commenting on the Bill introduced to Gosdum today, the first chapter of the thought committee on information policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he saw no problem with the postponement of the date of the entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that companies that would not have their own Russian personal data warehouses in Russian territory by 1 January 2015 would be able to rent them, for example, “in Rostelekoma”, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to rent their servers and already provide their servers, at the Mail Group, to Western companies that already provide their servers today”.
“In addition, there are several independent centres ready to cooperate in this area”, he added.
“If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problems: they will have technological opportunities to accommodate”, said Levin.
Controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association for Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the draft law was adopted, the Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, it is a service for the online armouring of airline tickets and hotels.
According to the association, “the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data by imperative determining that their recording, systematization, etc. shall be provided only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement underlines that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the recording is carried out, to systematize its personal data.
In such a case, it will be able to choose which territory these actions will take.
The adoption of such laws on “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the care of global services and significant economic losses.

The militias transferred over 400 prisoners to Ukraine's military
In Novorossia Army, they claim to have beaten the Ukrainian Su-27 and accuse the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
The militias, as at 10:00, on 1 September, handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as 35 deceased soldiers.
Interfax was informed by a representative of the Press Service Army of Novorossia.
He added that “by the forces of the Air Force in the area of the Mereschki settlement, the Su-27 aircraft breached the ceasefire arrangements”.
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in the shelling of the Lugaan airport.
The representative of the press noted that the militia had been able to damage two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters per night on one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armoured transporters and two ammunition stores.
“The loss in the living strength of the opponent — up to a hundred people killed and wounded — has fallen to 13 prisoners”, summarized the headquarters representative.
Interfax does not have the confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the “national republics” of Donbass declared the transfer to the Ukrainian side, within the framework of the ceasefire of 223 captured soldiers and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, during the night, the DNR army, according to the Novorossia Army, “cut off the attempt by the natsguards in violation of previous arrangements to withdraw heavy equipment from the area of the environment”.
At that time, the militia reported the destruction in the short-term combat of two tanks and two BMPs, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to headquarters, the total loss of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luganski, Mariupolski) during that night was five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian troops were in the militia area in the Iloviska region of Donetsk.
President Vladimir Putin requested the leadership of the “national republics” to release Ukrainian troops from the environment.
In the DDR, it was agreed to do so subject to the surrender of the enemy of weapons and ammunition.
The first dozen soldiers started leaving the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion Denbass Semenchenko, another 14 people left the village on Sunday.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are “in captivity in 137 regiments of 32 divisions of the RF and 9 tank brigades of the RF”, where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Minoborons of Russia have denied reports by Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will respond to new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to respond in order to protect its legitimate interests if new anti-Russian sanctions are imposed, reports the RFID.
A Russian external diplomatic agency report states that the conclusions of the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their viewless support to the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, drawing on “absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of the country”, says the department's website.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regrets that, contrary to the interests of its member States, the Euroscow has been influenced by countries that are interested in strengthening their confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for the conditions for a fully-fledged “logue between the opposing parties”, the agency emphasizes.
The department also noted that there were no targeted assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster had taken place, as well as an increasing number of casualties among the civilian population.
Recall that specific proposals for sanctions against RFs are planned for the next seven days in the European Union .
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with US officials.
They are expected to correlate the imposition of measures for the period of action and severity.
The new European Union sanctions could touch on energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and petroleum products.
Smart ways to save money in university textbooks
Although the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schröder, who is about to move to second grade, came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system for renting books from senior students, offering them nominal compensation to postpone their sale.
"My math study textbook, which usually costs $180, I got a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A oven," says Schröder, 19 years old, who goes to Covenant College, Georgia.
The literature needed at last semester would be $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and teaching materials, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly choose Internet stores and creative ideas like Schröder's.
The rolling of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often cost significantly more than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, owned by more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book laundering has doubled since 2011.
Research by the industry shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, says Vice President Nibo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookshops, according to the professional association National Association of University Shops.
Here's an introduction course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Buying in Internet Shop
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one-third of what you see in a university bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler's ninth edition of Mathematical Analysis is about $290 for a pre-selection, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in textbook sales.
Purchase of a self-sufficient
If you don't mind any other person's markings or injuries, the textbooks you've kept are a good option.
"Mathematic analysis" is sold for $93.49 in retained form at Chegg.com.
Matt Casey, 25 years old, a fourth-year student from Brigham Young University, said he had paid for a 42-cent copy of the textbook “Strategic solutions in the media: Understanding the business side of advertising.”
The book was sold for $48 new.
For example, ingrid Braisi, Director of the College of Walls at the Massachusetts University in Amherste, invites students to clarify with their professors whether previous editions should not be used.
There are times when updates are not essential for the class.
In such cases, old publications are often found at a very small percentage of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, belonging to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Prostate
To rent textbooks, you should think about it if you treat them well enough, don't forget to return them, and don't want to leave them behind after the course is over.
You can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student could rent a "Mathematic Analysis" for a semester of about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you may receive for markings, stresses and injuries.
If you rent a book, remember: If you don't return a book, fines can even exceed the cost of a new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are rented by electronic licenses for a certain period from distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" ticket on Chegg.com for six months will cost approximately $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most beneficial prices, since many classical works can now be jumped free, whereas literature on natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Holt, 29, who is going to start studying at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the book prices, since it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Golt says before ordering the Internet, make sure the book is in stock.
It was not easy for him to learn.
The book he acquired was delayed for four weeks, and eventually he paid a full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declared the full inefficiency of the Far East Development Fund
President Vladimir Putin of Russia announced at a meeting on the leadership of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget development fund for the Far East, established two years ago, was not effective, Interfax reported.
“15 billion rubles have remained on deposits,” said the President.
During the meeting, the Head of State tasked to expedite the adoption of the list of pre-development Territories in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of the TORs should be introduced into the Gosmedium of the fall.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, had never approved the list of pre-development territories in the Far East before 1 July and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also set out the main challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, the region ' s transport accessibility, the lifting of infrastructure restrictions, both in the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there was a need to create assumptions to attract additional investment in the region, as well as to create pre-development areas that should be competitive with key business centres of ADPs, the President emphasized.
It was previously reported that the pre-development area could replace the EEZ.
Why did the Galaxy Watchers not save cash charges?
"Inconsistent 3" Sylvestra Stalin returned less than $30 million of his $90 million budget to the United States, while "The City of Sins: The Woman Who Should Kill" returned only $12 million from his $70 million budget.
Home Video with Cameron Diaz has brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films, such as "How to get the dragon 2" are also disappointing.
Telegraph article Robbie Collina points out that when it comes to children’s films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colleen named 2014 as the worst year in history for children's films, and he called "How to use dragon 2" only a "functional" continuation of phantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience of a few older age, the problem does not necessarily seem to be the same as films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic each film released in the summer of at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account both film viewers and film critics, suggest that last year's film production is similar to last year's hit caliber.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing visual habits and increasing popularity of stream Internet services, such as Netflix.
The director, John Favro, who is currently working on a soon-to-be dyneive movie called "The Jungle Book" told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what was before.
In contrast to the current fall in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the flow reproducing service reached $1.2 billion, almost twice the previous year's figure of $837 million.
Last summer, the director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for being too dependent on the comic book franchises, and predicted the Hollywood crack.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators argue that his dark predictions were the share of the truth.
Since several potential cash hits are expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including “Arra Altron”, “Minionov” and “Yurish Park”, other film industry representatives are more optimistic.
The producer, Human X, Simon Kinberg, recently called the drop in cash charges simply "cycled," said Hollywood Reporter, "The following summer will be the worst cash summer in history, and no one will ever worry about it."
The product sanctions do not frighten the owners of establishments from the Caucasus and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in the European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
Generally speaking, the general public prefers to replace the prohibited imports, not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There is a salty cucumber rather than a bad mozzarella," the Italian restaurant chef Barlotti Mariano Valerio collapses on the quality of cheese offered to him by suppliers in exchange for Italian.
Mozzarella and the cheese burrito ended up at the restaurant first, they have a small storage period.
Parmesan supplies should take a few more months.
What should I do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilsk market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes clear: The shocking memories do not release him until now.
The meat was only 30 inches [30 cm] from the floor!
There's cats in there!
Rats!
Then I said we'd never buy anything for our restaurant in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe everything's changed now.
But the other day, they brought me fish from the Far East for a test.
That's how she was skinny!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised to learn that many of Italy’s usual products are for the Russian wildlife manufacturer.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to work out to be soft so the muscles can relax.
I did it with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such tender meat?
I said it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
In five minutes walking from Barlotti to the French restaurant Brasserie Bridge in the kitchen is a stop-list indicating the missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The chef at Brasserie Bridge and the Strelka bar, Directes Trigger, not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheese, the restaurant will purchase Swiss.
After all, Régis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Blood cabbage is 200 roubles!
I say, "Why is it standing so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make a living too."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 roubles!
We buy the Far East oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, and you can imagine how much their armor weighs?
At a price, it's a superdelikates.
Russian suppliers appear to be one of the main sources of scarecrows for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were all right, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibres and quality.
Many restaurants in the European kitchen do not know what will happen to them when the cheese is finished.

Cancellation Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of individual economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are mostly referred to as food sanctions.
The country is prohibited from importing beef, pork, meat and sub-products from domestic birds, meat delicacies, fish, dairy, milk, yogurt, art, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants started with a supplier’s drawer: food prices have grown, and there is an urgent need to search for analogies from other countries.
Most of this will affect expensive restaurants with French, Italian, Spain, where products were delivered directly from the “Materinian” countries.
The public had to be restructured before.
For example, when Rosselchznadzor banned the importation of Australian beef in early 2014 and, one year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers supplied beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
However, the 2014-2014 sanctions have been much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the prohibition of Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar, peas and onions for sowing.
Italian Valerio hoped that sanctions could be further mitigated.
So far, some of the restaurants are in a state of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imports in the premium segment was 70 per cent.
“Dear restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries do,” says Sergei Mironov, a restaurant owner, owner of the Restconsult agency.
If the chef's strong, he won't be a problem.
We only have very few of these cooks, and the new menu can take two or three months to develop.
The Brusserie Bridge triangle is ready to do this: it will have to give up 10-15% of the dish, and half the menu will be reworked.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens they are already beginning to replace dishes, such as a marble beef steak with befstrogans, Sergei Mironov says.
“Sirens from Europe may be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, by Oksana Glibchuk.
Plums and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway — salmon, semgo, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of vegetables and fruit from European production may be compensated by domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, the budget of the network restaurants will be modified more easily than the premium segment: it is unlikely that the gourmets were able to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it would be difficult for Ginza Project institutions to do so, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under various brands and with their menus.
There will be plenty of time left in exchange," said Mironov.
In Ginza, comments were rejected, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from former Soviet republics smell more European
But there are also many restaurants that will hardly touch the sanctions.
These include the CIS cuisine: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and coffee "Waj Me!".
"All cheeses are made for us in Russia, the basics of many dishes are chicken fillets, exotic greens we don't use."
No dishes have been removed from the menu in the Klbia institutions.
Timura Lansky, owner of the Cheyhona N1 restaurants from Uzbek cuisine, and the sanctions do not make it difficult for him to change only to New Zealand lamb.
If Russia sets imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win at a price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
It can be used cheaply for cutting, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.
However, what comes from Central Asia is much better than plastic from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes, they're delicious, they're sweet.
No one talks about Spanish that way.
Following the imposition of the sanctions, the representative of Minskvodhoz Uzbekistan, Olymba Artikov, said that he planned to double the export of fruit products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan stated their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
The fastfood restaurants, which responded to Deneg's request, also respond calmly to sanctions.
McDonald's Press said that the localization exceeds 85% and the network is operating with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80 per cent of the network products are purchased in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of vegetables and with the rising prices of meat products produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremek, “sanction products” were not more than 4 per cent of the total.
They didn't touch the sanctions or walker.
KFC, Burger King and Short Cartoska did not respond to Deneg's request, but other market participants argue that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly lower than that of McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East
On my back.
In the meantime, restaurants complain that rising demand makes prices even for local products.
"The prices for Groblay's products rose by an average of 10-15 per cent, for Cherry Mio's Italian restaurant twice," says restaurant Roman Rožnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will rise by 5-10 per cent, says Kolbaya.
East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian milk production has travelled 10-15 per cent since the beginning of August."
“Brazilian suppliers have raised pig prices almost twice,” complains Sergei Rak, Deputy Director General Stardogs.
The chicken was 35% short.
Waiting for prices from China, they may be stifling Brazil's hot heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have an 8 per cent increase in prices.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices,' says the cancer.
According to statistics, the increase in general nutrition income for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest since 2010.
The retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how fast the majority of the restaurants have been stocked for the next two months in the hope of overcoming the losses of purchase prices.
But in two months, no one knows.
There are a dozen tents in the square in front of Moscow's mayor, decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the stage, musicians play waltz.
It's a regional food festival called "There's time to eat."
"We've been going to make a celebration of local food a long time ago, and here we've just had sanctions, we've rushed, we've organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, the Greek cook Anastas prepares pasta salads and homemade confetti, a master class on the day to prepare a broth with caramelised apples.
Everyone from Russian products assures the organizers.
In tents is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people's economy.
Honey from Bashyria, reed from Salehard, vegetables from the Lenin's Sohoza Sovoza, cheese from the stomping Italian Jay Clouse.
"The salmon for restaurants can safely be replaced by another salmon species from the Far East," says the owner of the fishing bench "His People" Philip Galkin.
We've got a kidney, a ketchup, a leech, a humpback, a chauffeur, a royal salmon.
Yeah, they're not fat like Norwegian salmon because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it, it doesn't move.
And you can't hold our salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian national mozzarella
In the window of his tent lies shrimp with a burka Magadan, fever, omelet, muxon, midia with the Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's time to go fishing from the Far East for a long time.
Statistics show that fishing in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, that a large proportion of the fish goes to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
The People of His Love has been operating since 2012, selling fish through the Internet store, and before sanctions were imposed, it served another one and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Free Things".
There are now 15 more restaurants in Galkin.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, it burns.
We got cold, tried different recipes.
We're now selling sushi through an Internet store for a million roubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and our shipping is a maximum of 15 roubles per kilogram.
In confirmation at Galkin's tent, they're preparing me a portion of Philly with a ketchup.
Unlike the 7 - foot - long rolls, these have to live longer, but the realization that this fish, our fatherly fish, is giving us strength.
On the site of the "His people" bench, there are even the roles of the palate and the sea perch.
In Sushi bars, indeed, the Norwegian salmon are preferred to be replaced by Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this by making lazily cooks to come up with new recipes with a long-distance fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Eusew.
About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could take over the currently released niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimov project, it is now possible to refer to the replacement of imports from Europe and America by imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace prohibited imports as opposed to our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit primarily from large producers of other countries," Akimov said.
In fact, in the last month, the restaurant industry has also received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of the mass out-of-board inspections of Rospowicz, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropole and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are examining the substance of the claims made to determine the actions required to open the visitors' restaurants as soon as possible”, said the McDonald's Press Service Denham.
No one really understands what's going to happen next.
If everyone is restricted to food sanctions, it is one option that can be survived, says under the conditions of anonymity of the company involved in restaurant consulting.
If they close McDonald's all over the country, the script will be different.
Europrotocol instead of GIBD reference
Casca payments can be received without reference to the GIBDD - so the CB intends to stimulate the introduction of a "European Round" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guideline that, as of 1 September of this year, an insured motorist will be able to obtain payment on his helmets without a GIBDD certificate.
Indeed, it is only in cases where the accident was caused by a "European Round" without the involvement of a road police force.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the vehicle, there were no physically injured persons, no damage beyond the specified limit, and both drivers reached agreement on who caused the accident.
Since 2 August, the limit for European-Room payments is 50,000 rubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad, it will be increased to 400,000 rubes.
The point is that often even in minor injuries, in a situation where a car can be formed by a European-wheel drive, drivers who have been hit by an accident are responsible for the DPS.
After all, it was not possible to obtain a refund on the helmet without a certificate from the GIBRD.
The parameters set out in the draft guideline are precisely the aim of removing this obstacle to the introduction of the Europeantrotrotrotro-kol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum cost per helmet payment for non-GIBDD vehicles should not be less than the European-Road limit.
However, it cannot be higher than the limit specified in the helmet insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the DPS and the roads.
But it is likely that neither carers nor insurers will come to her delight.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which may lead to new rules for helmet payments.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian Conservatism.
The driver will, in most cases, wait for the inspector for hours to form a minor accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is not yet known that it will be easier to beat the frauds or convince the drivers of the safety of the Europeanrotocol.
The savings certificate shall be made nameless and irrevocable
Minfin wants to ban savings certificates from the consignor, but will allow the banks to make them an analogue of an irrevocable contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that prohibits savings certificates for the bearer.
Recently, this tool has gained popularity because the stakes here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that the savings certificates for the entity are not included in the deposit insurance system and they are cost-effective because they do not have to be credited to the Deposit Insurance Agency (SAB) fund.
The spectre of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and will be affected by Sberbank and the Moscow Bank, which are estimated to control 98 per cent of the profile market.
As a result, the Bank of Moscow accounts for about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASA, is that the customers of the small bank who bought such a certificate, if they withdraw their licences, try to get money from the ASA.
Some depositors, without sufficient financial literacy and purchasing savings certificates for the bearer, may assume that their investments are insured.
Justifiable lack of insurance payments under these certificates in the event of withdrawal of a licence from the bank could lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In practice, the agencies have experienced cases in which the holders of the certificates have tried to recover insurance compensation through the court," said the ASA.
The problem is, of course, pretentious.
Indeed, there will be no one to pay the purchasers the certificates anyway, since they have no legal right to reparation from the State.
If it were the case that the instrument was not insured in the ASA, it would also prohibit metal accounts where the funds of citizens are taken into account in grams of one of the four metals — gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but they are not yet being tried.
It is likely that the applicant's certificates are a very convenient price paper, which can in fact be a quasi-deneg.
However, their movement is almost uncontrollable: any bank customer can buy a certificate, hand over to any citizen, and before such a certificate can be processed, many owners can change it.
It is not an accident that the bill states that the savings certificate should be necessarily the exact securities to be stored in the depositary.
In order to lighten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogous to the irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiffa
On weekends, protests were held against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport to march against NATO.
On Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff’s Hall for what was described as an anti - samite.
Steven Fairclau followed up with us on the weekends and spoke with protesters who came from all over, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to Iraq 30 anti-tank complexes
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter the terrorist group “Islam State”, reports ITAR-TSS on 31 August with reference to the decision taken following the meeting of the FWG Government in charge of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reportedly sending 30 portable Milan anti-tank missile complexes and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Delivery will take place before the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate an additional €50 million to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a government statement on the subject in the bundestag.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to hot spots.
The views of the people of the FWG on the sending of weapons to the Iraqis have been divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the Islamic State, and others fear that this weapon could eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The militias submerged a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
The Donetsk militias submerged the Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August ITAR-TSS.
According to available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the human settlements of Shirokino and Bezimenno (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is said that the incident took place today at around 16:20 msk.
Teenagers took the Blue Mountain helicopters
TWO young Bushwalkers were taken to a safe place on a helicopter after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike shortly after noon on Sunday in Govetts Lip in Blackhat.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8:00 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was sent to include local police and rescue teams, and a couple were found about 11 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and lost his head.
The officers stayed with a couple a night, and they were picked up on a swan Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state of emergency vehicle.
Two Unions Meeting
The Minsk summits did not resolve the problems for which they had been convened but gave birth to a new format: the first European Union met with the first people of the future of Eurasian
Let the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discuss for the first time a number of “hot issues”.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively, incomprehensible; it is clear who removed the plums from the summit.
Questions on this matter fell down in the evening of 26 August, when Belarusians followed them and other Europeans saw the new President Lukashenko on television.
The Belarusian leader set an example of decrepit courtesy, that was the behavior of a man who had just broken down the Jack-pot, and planned a decent old age in a higher society.
How Majdan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak in a final briefing on their behalf, not just to legitimize the President with 20 years of service.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged European policy body and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Dennis Meliants, confident that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk with the same tone as it used to be.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met a tattoo with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to freeze," he said, "the fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the break-up of the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maidan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
“The results have also been achieved with the EU — these are successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization — are listed by the Ogonka interlocutor, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The U.S. even lifted a little of the sanctions.
In the case of Ukrainian events, they themselves and the response of the Belarusian leadership have only caught up with the process.
On the one hand, Minsk was able to maintain relations with Ukraine, warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Porozenko could come to Belarus to negotiate.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not accept the accession of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Russian militias in Donbass, was not in full conflict with Moscow.
Minsk has not left the Customs Union or the ODCF, and a Russian airbase is located in Baranović.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk ' s balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it by the Belarusian experts.
How successful the Lukashenko movement will be in political diversification will be seen by how often, in the near future, Minsk will have to meet in the EU+TS format.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions as to what Brussels expected from the relationship in the new format.
Spokesman Ashton Maya Kosianchich merely stated “Fire” that, in the light of the solution to the issues of war and peace, the topic was not a priority.
It was reported, however, that Kazakhstan could also be the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
President Nürsultan Nazarbayev's statement to Minsk, which declared him to be the subject, was personally requested by the representatives of the European Union.
However, during the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties did not object to Minsk being the centre of meetings, both in the form of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” becomes a fully-placed European leader who helps solve the global problem.
European Farmer’s Best Friend
The composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, had already led to the conclusion: the main complement of the summit, not the tragic situation in Donbassa, but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future gas negotiations and for overcoming the concerns of the TC countries in the agreement on Ukraine's EU association appears to be broader than peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl de Gucht, however, stated: EU representatives “have come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences rather than vice versa”.
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine is also working for Belarus.
Its consequences, particularly the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia, are given to Minsk, who, for the time being, suffers from the sanctioning pressure, a long-awaited field for manoeuvre.
According to President Jaroslav Romanchuk, Head of the Mises Research Centre, ex-candidate to the Presidents of Belarus, European investors are actively interested in the ability of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the RF to circumvent sanctions.
In doing so, the supply schemes that Vladimir Putin spent at the summit are being developed.
“Initiators of these schemes,” emphasized Romanchuk “Fire”, are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply schemes, including those from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
The Russian business needs to be reinvigorated, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies have not missed production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials, but also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian trade schemes can now be very needed.”
According to Romanchuk, the role of the EU and TC negotiations platform is ideal for Lukashenko and for developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agrarian sector from the sanctions of Moscow are estimated at EUR 5-10 billion, and the European Commission has now offered only EUR 125 million of compensation to agrarians.
The President of Belarus may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the effects on Eurofarmers.
This can raise Lukashenko's credibility in the EU at an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk has been segregated from its active role in the birth of the TS+EC format, and the Belarusian leader, at a meeting with the Ukrainian colleague, stressed that he was the initiator of the new format and has become Kiev.
“This was your proposal to gather, without any failure to discuss, not with the Bay of Barachts to take a decision, after signing the Treaty of Association with the EU, to address the situation that had taken place in Ukraine at that time”, he addressed the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.
After all, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, it was initially against Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, Belarus, in organizing EU and TC interaction on its land, is not self-sufficient, and the ultimate goal of this format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the area of security, are promoting and promoting the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said the “Fire” in Belarus's Ministry of Internal Affairs, which has recently been scrupulously worded.
In Moscow there may be areas with paid entry
The Government of Moscow sees the option of introducing paid entry zones as a method of combating congestion in the central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, passing M24.ru with reference to the Moscow freeze on transport issues by Maxim Lixutov.
One option that has successfully proved itself to be a paid entry.
That's an expert opinion, we'll have to examine it, look at all the minuses and the pluses.
To say that some decisions had been made in this regard so early," Lixutov said.
Zamera stressed that the experience of Asian cities in structure and loads similar to Moscow was very important for the capital authorities.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, Lixutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that the traffic does not necessarily pass through Moscow.
If there was sufficient infrastructure for the tour, there was no need for transit traffic in Moscow," said the Zammer.
Maksim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of paid parking spaces had considerably unloaded capital streets.
And he said that the capital authorities did not plan to stop at what had been achieved.
Recall, on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobjanin, participated in the ceremony of the construction of the first trigger complex of the Moscow Central Road Ring (CCAD).
Boring is wrong.
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodríguez "The City of Sins-2: A Woman to Be Killed" has done the wrong revolution that could be expected of him.
The first Sin City (2005), removed with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relations between cinemas, comics and literary numerals.
Sikwell is also revolutionary in the sense that he destroys the fundamental to modern thinking of the "thesis-antithesis-synthesis-synthesis" chain (if understood by the idea of the universe noura and by the antithesis-space comics).
It should now read: “Thesis is chaos.”
The town of sin-2 is chaotic at both the dramatic and the philosophical level: both are chaotic in the foolish sense of the word.
Yes, part of the characters are familiar with the first "Town," although, here, Marv (Mikki Rourke) is remembered, he's dead on the electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to pull, as this popular friend, out of the air of the knife and other strangled cannons.
But the old people are literally throwing their elbows at new ones, like they broke into town from some other movie, about the meaning and the story of which the audience is asked not to worry.
Thus, his story, shamelessly beaten by the authors in the most interesting place, at the super-successful player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
She's at Eva Lord's Thirsty Frigid Eve (Ewa Green) and for something to avenge her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion in which Dwight, let's say, doesn't look like Johnny's face, especially since people, like other parts of the body, suffer from unrelenting regularity, not trouble, not even half-days.
It's not people, we understand that it's Nuara archetypes: a rock bitch, too confident of himself, a game that's caught in a sex trap by a detective, a corrupt sanatorium.
Well, when the archetype is walving with the archetype and the archetype is chasing, it's not a movie anymore, it's an abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this messy world, there's always something.
The war whores from the first city continue to hold round defenses against their dwindling native slums of darkness.
Detective Hartigan's ghost isn't, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's always nice to see Bruce Willis.
The main problem of the City of Sins-2 is another.
Frank Miller was good at putting comics and noirs together as a painter, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to put comic books on the screen.
Comics and Nuar are two aggressive opposite "realities".
The phenomenon of modern comics was born in the late 1920s, whereas the novels of Dashil Hemmet "Blood Harvest" (1929), "Malthian Falcon" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of Nuar, then known as the hard-boiled school, the "cool school".
Either that or a pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from Popeye's seaman, a spy eater, who gives him wealth, Superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy's sparkle to Halk, Torah, Popeyeka spider, and other vengefuls.
But in any comic book film film, there was something harmful: the painted characters were stubbornly unwilling not to grow on the screen, to remain the havens in the surrounding will-to-slaves of the “real” world.
To put it simply, they were completely deprived of their "existence".
On the contrary, Nuar is the most existential genre of world literature.
After world wars, a traditional novel -- with experiences, characters, family scandals and a historical background -- has lost all credibility.
Which forsailants, which Tibo and Rugon McCarrah, who even the Bolconean and Rostov think after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel was peacefully mutated in the shape of a soap opera, and criminal - i.e. by definition marginal - romance rose to the level of the philosophical prose.
Hammett found out on his skin that this was the way to work as a nurse on the front.
He was a communist.
In fact, they were at least close to the company and genre pillars, such as the writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directed by Jules Dasson, Joseph Lousey, Edward Dmitrick.
That's why the nouar, the archetype they put in, first of all, is crude and cynical, and second of all, it's strictly social.
That's hardly an American version of socialism.
The first "Vehicle of Sins" was remarkable precisely what was unnatural but organically connected the comic with noisy.
For the first time on the screen, the comics were alive without ever narrowing down their graphic nature and not pretending to be a "real" movie.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered the killings, and the senator covered the monstrous son of a sadist, was quite worthy of Hammett's pen.
And the vivid details, like the severed heads, that the sadist decorated his nest, that of the genius James Elroy, that of the Black Orchid and the best -- that is, the declaratively insoluble, representative of the Neonuar.
The City of Sins-2 is not even a retreat, it's a surrender of the radical stylistics of Miller-Rodriches before the tradition of the comic book.
It must have happened a lot because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second "Vehicle of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass ball, in which the snow dries up a toy club.
After all, it's not mostly snow, it's bloodstains, but on a large scale, what difference does it make?
Well, there's nothing to say about sociality.
Indeed, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere in our time, may be on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can bring back a girl on a curved road or, let's say, to the disheartening parents, that her loser is punished.
But when there is no place in the city of sin but sin, there is no more sin than sin.
Boring like any norm.
Chaos The City of Sin-2 is boring.
For the sake of justice, the fatherly roll gave this fresh sin a small but partial.
The titres warn: The film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
As for the show, in the Vegetarian episode where a man's fingers are broken by his claws, it's a hell of a humor.
Hammet would love that.
French Socialists must “close up and bring France to order” says key ally François Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces “to demonstrate a warm attitude” towards an assaulted president-socialist whose alterations had not been endorsed by the vast majority of French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him," he said, in applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister believed that his Government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite inciting proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobira, Minister of Justice of the Union, put sticks in wheels, bringing dissensive members of parliament to the assembly from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost faith in the future”.
Marin le Pee, leader of the very right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for permanent internal conflicts among socialists, said that she did not think that the new Valla Government would last for more than a few months.
François Allland is the naked king, but the naked prince and Prince Manuel Valle, who is forced to gather a new government when the past did not last.
"And the new will not last either in the fall or in the winter," said Mrs. Penn to the reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, said she was confident that the party could win early elections and was ready to rule.
France's ruling party survived the collapse of the March municipal elections, and the very right-wing National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believed that the Socialist Party risked disbanding several rival factions until the end of Mr. Holland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Xianz Poe, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to be quickly felt that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
The City Without Drugs is without a suit.
The Sverdlow arbitral tribunal left without consideration a claim from the Regional Directorate for the Administration of Guests to the City Without Drugs Foundation.
The Office intended to recover more than 7 million rubles from the organization as rent for the building in downtown Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear before the court twice.
Today, the Sverdlow District Court left without consideration the application of the executive directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders of the Ekaterinburg Mayor Evgeny Roiseman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million rubles from the organization as rent for the building.
Today it was known that the plaintiff had not been brought to court twice, which had led to the decision to refuse.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the Directorate of MUGISO was not able to explain, the head of the Legal Department of Maxim Titus did not respond to telephone calls.
Nor was it possible to contact the representatives of the fund.
To remind you, this is a specialty that has been held in the centre of the city on the street of Belinski, 19 on a gratis basis since 2011.
This decision was made by Alexander Misharina, ex-Guiret.
In November 2012, the office of the Ministry of Public Property Management of Sverdlovsk sued the Sverdlov arbitral tribunal for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the case, the department had requested that, through the court, an open-ended agreement should be recognized as free of charge by the storage of a monument.
In the view of the IUGISO, the agreement did not provide for substantial conditions for the rental of cultural heritage.
The Sverdlovski arbitral tribunal rejected the claim, and an appeal was filed before the 17th Permi arbitral tribunal, which was granted.
The fund then filed a cassation complaint against the decision, which was dissatisfactiond, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court took the party to the authority.
In 2013, a new lease contract was signed, where the fund began to pay the rent again, and the head of the city of Evgeni Roiseman described it.
The rental fee was set at 300,000 rubs per month.
The previous administration handed over this building to us free of charge, acknowledging our merits in the fight against drugs, to the respect of the fund.
The current administration decided otherwise," he stated.

Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was invited to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the mayor of Yekaterinburg, one-handed Alexander Kosincev, invited the mayor of the town, the Speaker of the Pride, Evgeny Roiseman, to resign.
A criminal case arose against a retired member of Oleg Kinev's pride, who was considered an accomplice to the mayor, who was suspected of killing a retired member of the mayor.
How Evgeny Royce found a criminal case
On 1 July, it became known that a criminal case had been initiated on the basis of a “chavette” (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code) in a blog by the Mayor of Ekaterinburg, Evgeny Roizman.
Anna Filatov, Director of the Legal Centre for Protection, reported on this in the Ministry of Sverdlovsk District, where the relevant statement was made.
According to her, Mr. Royce accused her of being involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her former spouse in his blog.
The Mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that “it is another attempt to avenge the truth”.
iPhone Turn into a T-shirt
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there are new leaks in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
With reference to sources, U.S. media reports that the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile basket as a result of a joint Apple project and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express on 9 September Apple can be announced for presentation of new products, making the new iPhone 6 smartphone available as a mobile basket.
Companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This function makes it possible to pay on the store record using a smartphone.
The payment identification will be made by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will first be equipped with NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows for an indefinite payment by means of a smartphone and an appropriate reading device on the tape.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC was represented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum, the promotion association of this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone for Android with NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was submitted in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet to allow users to attach bank cards to their Google account and to pay with a smartphone to Android.
In fact, US experts stress that despite large investments by high-tech companies in NFC technology promotions, US retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores by such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple’s entry into the market will still make the retailers accelerate and more actively implement the technology in its trading venues.
France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Paris' position on supplies to Russia is unchanged
An official of the French IID, Romen Nadal, stated that Paris had maintained its position on the supply of Mistral helicopters to Russia.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (France Holland) in an interview by Le Monde of 20 August: "Today the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is a decision of Europeans, not of France," quoted Mr. Nadal "RIA Novosti".
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy department replied to the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would have a bearing on the change in the Paris position to implement the contract.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stage of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market value company, access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises customers, as it competes with the larger rivals of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could already be announced this week, sources reported on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
Owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
Sources requested to remain nameless, as negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands of Oceania and the Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She claimed income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier.
It is expected that the growth of the middle class in developing economies, such as China and India, will benefit from the $29 billion cruise industry in subsequent years.
The companies are trying to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered in the U.S. regulators for initial public stock placement in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was established as it now exists in 2000, as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lima Kok Tei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a share of 28 per cent, Apollo owned a 20 per cent share, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP held a share of 8 per cent in the company at the end of June, according to the reporting.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of North America cruise traffic, according to registration documents at the first public location of Prestige Cruises.
The Crimea TV company can receive 250 million rubles
In the Russian Ministry of Communications, the government broadcasts Crimea 250 million rubles in 2014.
According to the draft Mincommunity Order, the disclosure of regulations on a single portal is intended to cover “the costs of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be used to purchase equipment, roof repairs and energy systems in a radio company building based in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
Activists of the Hong Kong democratic movement disrupt the Chinese representative's statement the day after the election decision
A group of citizens, loyal to Beijing, stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress decided on Sunday that only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the elections of the head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of the majority of the members of the Electoral Committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for a democratic opposition to get into the ballot paper and has forced democratic movement activists to promise to stop Hong Kong's financial centre with the "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will be extended to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control over Hong Kong in June, democratic movement activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business centre and set up a sitting strike.
The briefing by Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress, Jean Rongshun, and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao State Council, Feng Wei, were also scheduled to address a series of briefings during the day.
The activists said they would gather at the building of the head of the Hong Kong Government in the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities have announced their intention to join 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River, owned by Palestinian autonomy.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli youths this June.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence declared the occupation of the Territory on Sunday and ordered the military to establish administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saib Arikat, the world public should call on Israel to answer for “the continued settlement activity on the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin demands Kiev to start negotiations on "Statehood" in eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his observations, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “statehood” of the separated region.
His Spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the Eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev Government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels was equal to the obvious strategy that he should have followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: help separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossa actual independence to draw closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with the State First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of the separatist territory in eastern Donetsk and Lugan areas, which were seized in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the occupied territories of Novorossiya, or New Russia, which refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that the peace talks would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian policies began campaigns for the 26 October parliamentary elections and while government troops attacked peaceful settlements in detained separatist regions, “Illusions”, ITAR-TASS reported.
“We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political order of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words on statehood were made in the context of broader autonomy, which was discussed over the months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give Eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention of the Kremlin Spokesman to correct the “misleading interpretation” of Putin's words stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the separatist rebellion in the east in a way other than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people were ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugan areas of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million non-Russian population, and interviews prior to the beginning of the conflict showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy which Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to define trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, to hand over actual control over the territory of the Kremlin, which would link Russia's main territory with the Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, joined five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial sea institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov Region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and Lithuanian factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Peter Porosenko proposed, during his inauguration speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators should weigh amendments to the constitution after the new elections, allowing for greater control of their financial and linguistic status in the separated regions.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist insurgents, whose arms and incitements are accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to agree with separatist leaders, as equals, followed the new attacks of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from before the peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
Russian-supported separatists have taken control of the city of Novozazówsk in the offensive, about which Ukrainian security officials say they fear it is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory up to Crimea itself.
This has resulted in extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupoli, a steel port of 500,000 inhabitants, between Novozazowski and the narrow passage to the Crimea Peninsula.
On Saturday, Porozenko called on the European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was independent of 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of non-refoulement," Porozenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken certain measures; leaders have called for a draft more severe sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Iloviska after two convoys of Russian armoured personnel and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the hardships of separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Spokesman of the National Security and Defence Council, informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers who reportedly were detained in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airlifters captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lisenko reported on Sunday.
A striped-picture scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust with the hackers who may have stolen some naked photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was outraged after a number of frank photos depicting Jennifer Lawrence naked had been hit on the Internet as a result of a massive celebrity hacker scandal.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 frank photos of the Star of Hunger Games Lawrence and superstars, including the models Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, Rianna singers, Arian Grande and Leah Michel and actress Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky, and living in Melbourne, Greco also allegedly stole photos as a result of the escape from iCloud.
In list 101 the names of the celebrities.
Edelsten, who made a proposal to Greco last month, said to the Confidential, "That's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was “a disgraceful” and that the ones to whom it was directed “seems to be invaded”.
The hacker is supposed to have 30 photographs of Palmer with a former boyfriend named Scott Speedman, including two frames, where she lies in a pool with her chest exposed.
Palmer's work in the movies includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the movie "Chuck" Strakhowski and the actress from "Prohibited Admission" Browning didn't comment on stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "This is a sudden invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker, wrote on Twitter: "Teaching photos stolen from a mobile phone is really no different from selling stolen goods."
It's just from a legal point of view that you can't tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
Potential theft of photos of exposed celebrities detected
The massive break-in of star accounts may have been caused by vulnerability in the annex Find My Phone.
The potential scenario of events described the resource The Next Web.
A Python script was published on the Github resource that allowed you to select passwords to the Apple My Phone Service.
This service allows you to track the iPhone location.
Apple ID is the same link as Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities have been stolen to access it.
The script lets you recognize the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The script author argued that the number of passwords entered is unlimited in the Find My Phone service.
If the security system is properly organized after several failed attempts to enter the wrong account password, the account must be blocked and the user informed of the failure attempt.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to select a password to their account.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to the user Hackapp on Twitter, vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting program was written to select passwords.
At present, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource had been linked to the Hackapp user and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was characteristic of many services, but he noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability had been used to access the "star" account.
It's not me, it's me.
Foreign records re-emerged on Twitter by the Prime Minister
Although there is no solid evidence that vulnerability has been used to steal photographs in Find My Phone, there has been a wave of harmful actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted control of the device and demanded the purchase from the owners.
In that case Apple stated to the media that the safety of the cloud had not been compromised, but no investigations had been conducted into how users had lost their accounts.
Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, has also been tweeted.
If the inventors have access to iCloud as described above, the password of the head of government account in the microblogging service may also be stored there.
The Next Web was unable to obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin provided Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-fight
President Vladimir Putin provided Russian citizenship to the well-known Ukrainian athlete Anne Burak.
The relevant decree was published on the Legal Information Internet portal.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia for a permanent residence and asked the Federation for an opportunity to speak for a collection of RFs.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won a silver medal from the European Championship in her personal championship, and became a champion of the world in a mixed relay, which is a new type of sport programme.
It retains leading positions in the current season as well.
Under the rules, to speak at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, it would have to obtain special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue the Russian passport to chess player Ekaterine Lagno - Flower of Lviv, a two-time European champion (2005, 2008), the world at the sight of (2010) and the quickest chess (2014).
In Ukraine's women's team, the athlete was the winner of the Turin Olympics (2006), the Astana World Cup (2013) and the Europe Warshaw team champion (2013).
UKR halted the investigation into the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigation Committee (PSC) has terminated the criminal investigation into the crash of the Tu-204 Red Wings aircraft.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the detour.
The forensic examination showed that the crash caused an increased rate of boarding, failure of standard landing procedures by crews, and unintentional engine failure to operate on high direct loads.
The Tu-204 Red Wings aircraft, followed by the Prague Moscow flight, crashed on 29 December 2012 at the Vnukovo airport in Moscow.
The aircraft went off the runway and got hot.
At the scene, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot and the quartermaster were killed.
Two shipyards were taken to treatment facilities, where they subsequently died of injuries.
Three other onboard conductors who were hospitalized with severe bodily injuries were treated for a long time.
In addition, the driver of the vehicle was seriously injured when he was in a car crash on the Kiev highway.
There were no passengers aboard the aircraft.
After the crash, the Transport Prosecutor ' s Office conducted an inspection at Red Wings, which revealed numerous violations.
In February 2013, the airline licence was suspended.
The company resumed its work in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko began training in SIZO
A prominent Russian mixed-style fighter, 33-year-old Alexander Emelianenko, who is in SIZO for sexual assaults against a domestic worker, has recovered completely from the trauma and has started training.
This is reported by the Champions Department.
In May of this year, the Russian Investigative Committee charged Alexander Emilianenko with rape.
The suspect was reported wanted, detained in Tamba on 9 May following his accident, which led him to a hip fracture.
Emelaenenko-Younger was arrested until 31 August and sentenced on 1 September.
However, the court had been transferred and the investigation had insisted on extending the detention period until 30 September.
If the athlete is proved guilty, he will be liable to imprisonment for up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
Lenta.ru recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelianenko's career.
His last unit, Emilianenko, spent January this year, losing to the technical knockout of his fellow countryman, Dmitry Sosnaski.
Alexander is the younger brother of the famous Fédor Emilianenko.
The latter is a four-time champion of the world on mixed martial arts, a four-time champion of the world, and a seven-time champion of Russia on a fighting samba.
The anger has proved to be the most universal and functional human emotion
The angry expression of the person is biologically universal to humanity, and every organ and group involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threats, has been identified by scientists in Australia and the United States.
They described their findings in Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly read about them in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the faces, which are moved and put down by the eyebrows drawn in the thin line of lips, the swollen nostrils, are the same in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth children who have never seen it, notes the lead author of the study Aaron Sal.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion had arisen for the effective management of disputes during the conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his circumstances, and he brings it to the interviewer with anger.
Researchers have also found evidence of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more angry and hand-to-hand, consider themselves entitled to impose conditions that are disadvantageous to others, and prefer forceful solutions to conflicts in peace.
While noting that anger is primarily a “trafficking emotion”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry expression should represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor, thus forcing them to agree as soon as possible to his conditions in order to avoid conflict.
In order to verify this hypothesis, researchers modeled on a computer persons where each of the seven elements of an angry person was present or absent and showed them to the informants.
Although the bowed eyebrows or the forward chin alone did not make the person evil, the stronger physical subjects of the study unanimously recognized the person with such traits.
The wrath of man, like that of animals, is a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of self-power that compels consent and submission.
A man shakes his nostrils and grabs his lips for the same purpose as a puffin or a baboon who shows off his claws.
“The anger is “launched” by the interrogator’s refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that demonstrates to the contrary the consequences of the refusal as effectively as possible.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said anthropologist John Tubi.
The Ministry has proposed the allocation of 250 million rubles to Crimea Radio Company.
In 2014, Minsk proposed that 250 million rubles be allocated from the federal budget to the autonomous non-profit organization Teleradiocompany Crime.
This is referred to in the draft government regulation prepared by the agency that was consulted by Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, the federal budget grants will be directed “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is intended to upgrade the hardware unit, video walls, central hardware and video service.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, from the funds allocated, the company will pay for the use of the fibre-optic line (WOLS) and for the repair of the energy system.
Grants will be made available within the federal budget provided for the Ministry of Communications.
The State Broadcasting Company Crime was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, more than 75 per cent of the territory of the peninsula has been television coverage.
In 2011, Krim Teleradiocompany was licensed for digital television broadcasting.
