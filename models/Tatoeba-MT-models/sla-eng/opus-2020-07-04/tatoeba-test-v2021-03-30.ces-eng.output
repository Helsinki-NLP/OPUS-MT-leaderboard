He knows wine.
Tom felt someone knocked on his shoulder.
Do you know who the parents are?
No words will express how amazing you are.
I'd like fruit juice.
Is it raining tomorrow?
The Klin font invented by Sumery was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I like summer, but I can't stand the heat.
Of course I do!
Mary loves you.
What do you want?
What does TATOEBA mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found yourself a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks to me French.
Tom left a high tip on the table.
It's not above a glass of beer after a day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I'm still satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting, even when I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you were dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for it.
Tom's obviously lying.
Straight and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to get back to you.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's going to be 13 tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch him ruin his life.
Do everything with balance.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We climbed Mount Fuji.
Me and my wife want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
The belt's too tight for me.
Playing on a fake is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are dying out fast today.
Tom's still busy.
You better get going now.
Tom's childless.
I like reading.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to interrupt, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train must have stopped because a fallen tree lay on the tracks.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in costumes from the 17th century.
Are you happy with your body?
May I speak to Tom?
I admired Tom once.
With great effort, he climbed a tree.
It's very difficult to translate Czech text.
Tom's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing, too.
We know all about this, Tom.
I'm glad you brought me up to speed.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.
They're falling sprouts.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like the tie.
We didn't do as well as we would have liked.
Please close the door when you're leaving.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you and Joana have a fight?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered in black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom had a cliché.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you going to school by train?
Tom won't be at school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom going to visit?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary's.
Why don't you ask me out for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I cannot answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It won't surprise me if it happens.
He's single.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom carefully washed his legs.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was as happy as she was when she got the recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
We wouldn't be in this glamour if you were to help us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's going to see his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in a place like this?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sang in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There's not enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom hasn't recovered.
I told Tom he's a fake friend and he took offense.
I'm doing laundry.
This bridge was a paid bridge.
He was swinging on her.
I was late for school this morning.
I took part in the search.
Sam went straight to bed.
We shot at the lawn by the river.
Tom never drank hard liquor.
Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm perfectly happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We have to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There was a half-cracked wall.
I spoke to him in English and he found out I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see a book.
Has any of you ever spoken to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence's fresh-cut.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You got fat.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to instructions.
Answer my questions.
They'd all be happy if Tom didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Bohemia and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting a divorce.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father came from?
Who are you?
Did you do that on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, and I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a laugh.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
Better dead than red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he wants to say.
The wedding was last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse shivers.
I lent him a comb.
I'm boring.
I write my will.
I'm not that stubborn anymore.
You're not gonna believe what Tom just told me.
Mary doesn't have anyone to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we're going for a ride.
Try talking to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'll get you something to drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She used to be bigger.
I assume he went home.
I was in the woods.
Tom got drunk.
He asked me to wait there until he got back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd better get back inside.
She doesn't have to do it.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
He's got his own house.
I don't usually do it tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can handle this alone?
I expected them to tell the truth.
Put it under the mat.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's a pain in the ass.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Throw the balloon to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I was a better person.
Stealing, huh?
Tom's got to comb himself.
You should deal with the lawyer in advance.
You're a good journalist.
Tom's used to it.
I love this book.
The garbage's stuck again.
When I came home from work, I found out that someone had stolen our apartment.
Read the book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like mute movies.
This works.
Cut the chatter.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Can the message be true?
It's easy to get, it's easy to stay.
Do you remember seeing me?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
Without her help, I would never have passed the test.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Can you translate French into English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning on going swimming with us.
Oh, my God, Tom, what the hell is this?
The audience looked bored.
If you need further information, please don't hesitate to call me.
When you get here, I'll be asleep.
I don't know how old Tom is.
I'd like you to come with me.
I told Tom it wasn't over yet.
Judy likes him.
Tom and Mary met with John.
Please don't do this.
You'll be happy again.
The baby climbed four times.
Tom's not taking his meds.
"Have you seen my phone?" "She's on the table."
Tom went to his locker.
First jump got bad.
Well, let's have lunch.
We should give him a gift.
In England, the waiter asked us, 'How many beers would you like, half a pint, or all?' Since we had no idea how much could it be, we asked him to show us a glass.
I'll tell Tom to cut your lawn.
I prefer English to music.
I like fish.

I'd like to be in Paris now.
You remember that?
I live in Turkey.
I don't want to disappoint my friends.
Mary is a very busy woman.
I don't know anything anymore.
Hungry and thirsty, we finally reached the inn.
It's not important, is it?

You're a good cook, aren't you?
I just wanted to say thanks.
Who's gonna pay for that?
Don't give up hope.
It wasn't cold.
Tom asked Mary to make him coffee.
They asked if they should write down new words.
He grows tomatoes in the garden.
Many people don't like hospitals.
