Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “associate with maps”
Some of the Chas are horrified by the recommendation to change their title to "member of the Welsh Parliament" (MWP).
This recommendation came because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament Wales.
WHILE all the political spectrum is concerned that it can provoke ridicule.
One of the labyrians claimed that his group was concerned about the Rome of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in the Welsh language "twp" means "undumb", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
Cha from the Wellsa Party stated that his group as a whole was “unsatisfied” and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh Conservators said that his group was "unbiased" before changing the name, but pointed out that MWP could quickly become a "mapper".
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to that of the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to change names, noted: “The final decision concerning the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Self - Government Act of 2017 gives the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public discussion on proposals, and the amendment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
With regard to what is called the Cha, the Commission proposes to call them "members of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP has received the most public support.
Of course, the Chas offer alternatives, but trying to get along can cause problems for the chairman, Eline Jones, who has to submit a bill of amendment within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on the decommissioning of the Cha and the structure of the committee system.
CHP will hold a final vote on its new name when legislation is discussed.
Macedonians go to vote for a referendum on the change of country name
On Sunday, voters vote to change the country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The vote was organized to resolve a long - standing dispute with a neighboring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that their northern neighbour’s name is a claim in Greece, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, who opposes a referendum on change of name, said he would ignore the outcome of the vote.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
Saint-Martin's bells are silent because Harlem's churches are going through tough times.
“The old people I spoke to say that there had been a bar and a church here before, ” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither one nor the other.”
He believes that disappearing bars can be understood as follows:
"Today, people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the local living room where they regularly go.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, and “they will end up where they started sooner or later”.
The churches, he added, could replace houses with condominiums, and there would be people living there who would not help the shrines that remained nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained, “so it will accelerate the day when all these churches close, for most of those who move to condominiums are unlikely to become their adherents.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870 and Saint-Martin was built ten years after it.
The indigenous white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The Black Community, which performed the rituals nearby, was granted the right of property to the building.
Saint-Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street retailers, Harlem's main trading street, who refused to hire black people and raise them on duty.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to rebuild it and installed the Carillion.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in Saint-Martin, proudly called the Carillion "the bells of the poor".
An expert who played the cartel in July referred to it differently as “a cultural treasure” and “an indispensable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that this was the first Carillion in the world to be played by the black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, moved to a bigger carillion in Riverside church.
According to Mr. Merrivezer, he had no replacements in Saint-Martin.
What's been happening in Saint-Martin over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of which have been involved by the leaders of the church, others by the Episcopalian diocese.
The Council is the governing body of the parish, which is made up of leaders - in July wrote to the diocese, which is concerned that the diocese “will try to pass on the expense” of the council’s failure to take part in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark was injured by a 13-year-old boy who was prowling behind a lobby in California
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy, and the boy prowled behind the lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the Lobster season.
The attack took place almost seven o’clock in the morning at the beach of Bicon in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been prowling with his friends for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was calling for help, and together with a group went to see him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a surprise for a caught lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I've been bitten!
I have been bitten!"
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his key was completely ripped open.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, "In the water of the shark!" added Hammel.
The boy was taken to the Xray Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
The rescue captain Larry Giles for the media briefing said that a few weeks ago the shark was spotted in the area, but it was determined that it did not refer to the dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim was traumatized by the upper torso.
For investigation and security purposes, the authorities for 48 hours blocked access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swam in Ensinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the British cosmetics market.
Sainsbury's going to compete with Boots, Super Two, and Debenhams with the same kind of cosmetics as the ones in the department store.
As part of the increased output to the British cosmetics market, £2.8 billion (continues to increase as the sales volume of clothing and household goods decreases) increased cosmetics islets will be protested in 11 shops around the country, and in the following year, if the idea is successful, the island will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics are related to supermarkets looking for ways to use the space that was previously used under television, microwave and home goods.
In Sainsbury's, they said they would double the range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 items, including branding such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will get more space: there will be brand zones similar to those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the Boutique cosmetics range: now most of the products presented will not be protested on animals, which are increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's retailer protestes his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and buying small amounts of food every day in small shops forces supermarkets to make extra efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, claimed that their stores would become more like supermarkets because the supermarket network is trying to counter Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's are opening Argos departments in hundreds of their stores, and there's also an open series of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and said it increased food sales and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to upgrade the department of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals failed.
Sainsbury's tested their cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after arguing about how to separate income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for £125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an extended range of luxury leather brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury, stated: “We have changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant to customers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who could give advice.
The range of brands presented to us is called to meet any needs, and the pleasant atmosphere and comfortable locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which represents competition with the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones is out of business because Holly Willoughby is out of the deal for £11 million.
Peter Jones' "Science" Star because Holly Willoughby was out of the deal with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is £11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for a brand of homewear and Truly accessories.
A couple's business was connected to a Goop Gwynette Peltrow brand.
The 37-year-old program leader This Morning announced her entry into Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones' "League of the Dragon" star to say when she came out of their profitable business goods for life at the last moment to focus on new and profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is “dissolved” when a gold girl from television confessed to a busy Tuesday meeting at the Johns Business Empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts worth £1.5 million mean that she no longer has time to devote her joint brand of household clothes and accessories to Truly.
This business was connected to the Goop Gwynette Peltrow brand and was to double the Willoughby's stock, which is estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of her rest homes.
Source reported: “Truly was no doubt Holly’s top priority.
He was to become her long - term future for the next few decades.
Willowby’s decision to get out of the business shocked all the interested parties.
No one could believe what was going on on Tuesday, almost the day before.
At headquarters in Marlowe, a full warehouse of stuff ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entrance of the leading This Morning, one of Britain’s highest - paying stars, may have cost millions of firms a large investment in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing) and may have created further delays.
This can also mean the end of long friendships.
The three children of Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
Couples spend holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s television companies.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony Mcpartlin as lead I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
The source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his affairs."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that would be considered “non-resident” as well as for a very positive attitude toward the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make such great strides? ”
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news bearer. —
I didn't make any progress."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump named them their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step forward to the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation have gone to a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading North Korean diplomat Ri Young Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see “an adequate response” from the United States to its first steps in disarmament.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to apply for pressure.
In giving a talk at his rally, Trump was far more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such wonderful relationships."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had been positive: the completion of rocket testing, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of U.S. military personnel to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act as presidents, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle-dressed stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and the Indonesian earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the Lombo earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombo’s population have been affected, the national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it’s a bit difficult,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children, a team is gathering to travel to Palu until it is known whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a member of the National Disaster Management Agency, stated that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In the province of Aceh, shelters from tsunamis are built, but they do not belong to other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning of siren in Palu, although the warning was likely helpful in death.
Moving between countless Indonesian islands is not just in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lomboc to treat the victims of an earthquake sails to Palu, but at least three days later it will be able to reach the scene of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia’s infrastructure through his election campaign and increased spending on roads and railways.
But the funding deficit has created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, which is planning to change in the following year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by the prolonged interfaith enmity in those parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people have died, tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of opposition from Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

A police official confirmed that the woman whose body had been found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in a house.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and the police have stated that they are now informing the victim’s immediate relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Muse just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told no one was allowed to come in and out of the house.

The statue of Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new monument that will be affected by the "translation of history"
The removal of the statue would be a worthy payoff for the Taliban-style destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which were carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Mr. Crick's proposal for "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history" were referred to by Cromwell's community.
John Goldsmit, the head of Cromwell Society, said: “In view of the current debate on the removal of statues, what Oliver Cromwell's statue at the Westminster Palace will become a target was inevitable”.
The iconocracy of English civil wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his command.
Cromwell would likely be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell, sculptor William Hamo Tornejcroft, is a testimony to the moods of the 19th century and to the history of the figure, which many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmit told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many probably more at the end of the 19th century than now does Cromwell consider himself a protector of parliament against external pressure, in which case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether such an idea is entirely accurate is the subject of the ongoing historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the known figures representing one side of the conflict.
Its achievements as Lord Protector are also worth honoring and honoring.”
A killer pig killed a Chinese farmer before she died.
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwest China.
A man identified only by Yuan's name was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guichzhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinin, the province of Tsinhai, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is about to be vaccinated by pigs in a pigsty.
On Wednesday, he and his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan were reported to have left to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the pigman’s door was open.
The brother pointed out that in the piglet there was a large cabana with blood on its mouth.
Medical forensics confirmed that a 249-pound cabana killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were in blood and defiled, ” stated a cousin of the victim named Wu, quoted by Guyyang Evening News.
The security camera record showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police gathered evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent her from attacking people.
It is reported that seven Yuan and the administration of the market are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rarely, incidents of swine attacks have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing a man a severe trauma.
Ten years earlier, a 265 - pound [295 kg] pig held the Welsh farmer down to the tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pig in 2012, one Manitoba farmer reported to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a "terrier".
"They're just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring massive rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was predicted to weaken, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the near future, Rosa will bring rain with floods to the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa had wind speeds of 137 km per hour (this hurricane of category 1) at 5 o'clock in the morning on the weekend and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, along the Pacific Ocean, a well that moves eastward to the western coast of the United States, when Rosa gets close to the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it starts pushing a strong tropical humidity northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25,4 cm [25,4 cm] of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the next few days, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching valley will produce heavy rains in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 cm [2.5 cm] of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams, and the possibility of drifting into the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will increase rainfall by up to 5-7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in a large area of Arizona.
Rain floods are likely to deteriorate rapidly because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised not to walk to the desert because tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons a stormy river, and thunderstorms can bring torrential winds and dust storms.
In some parts of the northern coast of California, the rains will cause the rains to rise.
The amount of rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause infirm garbage flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainstorm in the region during the rainy season.
Some of the scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday morning and Monday morning, and it will become more extensive on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will be going over the Counter-Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October there may be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S., since the Arctic is getting colder, but the Tropics remain quite warm.
At times, this results in extreme temperature fluctuations at short distances.
On Sunday, a fine example of extreme temperature fluctuations in the central United States will be observed.
It's almost a 7-degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, summer heat will try to return and expand.
It is expected that in a large area of the center and east, the United States will be warm until October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeastern region will be 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C].
New York's temperature can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesdays, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long - term weather forecast, there is a high probability of average temperatures being exceeded in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were watching the Brett Cavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, over 20 million people on six television networks watched the thrilling testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blaze Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, the channels interrupted planned programs to report the last news Friday: a deal prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flakes about a one-week investigation by the FBI into the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh had beaten her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
It is quite likely that on Friday more than 20.4 million people were watching it, as reported by Nielsen's research company.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not possible to get numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
In comparison, this audience is about the size of an audience that looks at the playoff match or the Oscar prize.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavano’s assignment, was the leader of all channels during a hearing that lasted all day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, noted in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of the 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, CNN 2.52 million.
The interview remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central feature of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate republican announced that he was going to vote for Cavanaugh, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS locked the protestors screaming at Flaq when he tried to go to the elevator for the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes, during which he was barking, which was broadcast live on the CNN.
“I am standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth of the country?
They said to him, "You have authority, and many women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the committee’s hearing.
All cable and wide - spoken channels broadcast live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the promotion of Kavano’s candidacy for a full vote to the Senate.
Flake said he would do it only if he knew the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate next week, which would require a democratic minority.
Flaka has been partly convinced by his friend, Senator-Democratic Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and then with several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flaka’s choice had influence because it was obvious that the Republicans would have no votes to appoint Kavano without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans after leaving the European Union of "political games" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May attended a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview that followed Teresa's interview on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Checkers plan for Brexit, stating that he would offer Britain and the EU to bring a myth to each other “absolutely absurd”.

20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for second-degree murder charges, reported to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published videos of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
According to an affiliate CBS to WAFB, the police removed the glasses from the crime scene and noted that they had found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police informed him that he had confessed that he had shot Wade.
According to counsel, he was given a $350,000 bet.
The East Baton-Rouge Coroner's office released a previous report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation for the special police search unit in Louisiana State, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police, and the local citizens for helping in the arrest.
The sports director at Louisiana State, Joe Alva, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “the care and desire for justice”.
Simsu was 20 years old.
The forvard grew 198 centimeters in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of Louisiana.
In the past season, its average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 points.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at Louisiana State University, Will Wade said that the team was "deserted" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"This is what worries you all the time," Wade said.
The volcano casts ashes on Mexico City
Popocatepetl volcanoes ash into the southern regions of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Warning Center on Saturday called on Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater became active and 183 discharges of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored numerous noises and shocks.
In social networks, photos show thin layers of ash on a frontal glass of cars on the outskirts of Mexico City, such as Kjimilko.
Geophysics have noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.
Volcan, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police encountered Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors who advocate independence faced a special police unit, thousands of people joined protestors to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on separation.
The masked proseparatist group, which was restrained by the specialty, threw them with eggs and powdered paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually filled with tourists.
The fighting took place and later on this day, the police used rods to suppress aggression.
A few hours later, a group of independence supporters who were chanting, “We won’t forget, we won’t forgive!” encountered supporters of the preservation of the country who shouted, “Let Spain live!”
According to the local press, 14 people were assisted in minor injuries sustained during protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, declared illegal by Madrid, but marked by Catalan separatists, tensions in an independent region remain high.
The voters generally voted in favour of independence, but the phenomenon was low, for the majority of those opposed to separation boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups spent the night in tents Friday to prevent demonstrations of support from national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to take another route.
68-year-old Narcisse Termes, an electrician involved in a separatist protest with his wife, claimed that he no longer had the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for joy that they can vote, but now we are in a dead end," he said.
In spite of the vital but very complex victory of the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties, who are acting for independence, were unable to maintain the momentum this year, because many of their best-known leaders are in voluntary expulsion or incarcerated in awaiting trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and for their subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who shot a protest against police support on the phone, claimed that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is getting stronger, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hungeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the detention centre since the end of last year, announced that he would be on his way to the European Parliament next year.
“The status of a candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the regressions of democratic values and the repression we see from the Spanish government, ” he said.
Londonderry: the men were arrested after the car drove into the house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after driving a car several times into a Londonderra house.
The incident occurred on Ballinaard-Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house itself had been damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point the car was fired from the ship.
The Manga hit the Livingstone to win the Rangers with a score of 1-0.
The first goal of Dolly Menga at Livingstone became a winner
The upgraded Livingstone stunned the Rangers and brought Steven Gerard a second defeat out of 18 games as Club Manager Abrox.
The hit by Dolly Menga turned out to be decisive: the Gary Holt team rose one level from the Hibernian in a second.
Gerald's team won no victory at this season's Premier League and next Sunday he's going to play with the Harts leaders, who are eight points behind it.
Prior to this, Raped Vienna will be hosted by the League of Europe on Thursday, Rangers.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues his unbeatable move to six games in the division, and Chief Coach Holt has not been defeated since Kenny Miller replaced him last month.
Livingstone misses the chances of uninhabited guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead long before they killed, because their line was creating Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, then Alan Litgou broke through the gate after he collided and took Craig Halkett's blow along the gate which he had made his head.
The hosts were pleased that they allowed Rangers to play before them, and they knew that they could cause problems for the guests from standard positions.
That's how the goal was scored.
Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingstone made an opening, and Declan Hallacher and Robinson set up Mango, who took the ball and killed the center of the fine.
Prior to this stage, Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but the defense of the field owners proved to be impenetrable and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was largely unconcerned.
This trend continued in a second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's punch hit a golfer named Rangers.
The curtains constantly flew into the Livingstone fine and were constantly neutralized, and the two requests on the penalty — after the attack on Glenn Middleton, who had been replaced, and behind the hand, were rejected.
Lingstone phenomenon: Analysis
Alasdar Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Makaroni Arena Stadium
The phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
All played very well for one, and they continued to exceed the expectations on this high-rise trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has remained virtually unchanged after returning to the highest level, but Holt must be given due for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket played tremendously, organized the defense very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be on guard all the time.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerard’s leadership, but now they’re far from reaching those standards.
They didn't have the last ball -- only once they broke through the defense of the field owners -- and it was kind of like waking up for Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogana was accepted in various ways in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and blue skies were seen.
This is the last day of the controversial visit by President Ergogan to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have raised some issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For reasons of security, the police did not allow 25,000 people to meet before the mosque, but many of the president's supporters showed up to see him.
Hundreds of Protestants against Ergogan — many of them Kurds — have also made themselves heard, condemning Ergogan’s politics and deciding to invite him to the country by the German government.
Two - side protests indicate the ambiguity of a visitor, whom some German Turks called a hero and others a dictator.
Depford Road Accident: The cyclist was killed in a car collision
A bicycle driver died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Deptford district in the southeast of the city about 10:15 a.m. in British Standard Time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man was killed on the spot.
This accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after an escape from the driver's accident on Childers Street, approximately 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
The London police said they were working on setting up a man to inform his closest relatives.
Bus routes are also banned, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six prisoners traumatized in riots
Six of the prison employees were traumatized as a result of a man-to-man riot, the prison administration reported.
The riots in her Majesty Long-Lartin prison in Wooster began at around 9:30 a.m. in British standard time on Sunday and are still continuing.
A special section of Tornado was called to stop the riots, initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing.
The officers were given medical attention in connection with minor facial injuries at the scene.
The prison official commented: “In order to solve the incident in Her Majesty Long-Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff were involved.
Six of the co-workers received medical care in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the responsible will be directed to the police and the term of their stay behind the bars may be extended.”
Her Majesty Long-Lartin prison has over 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison had been sent to hospital after the prison attack.
In October of last year, police officers called the prison to stop the serious disturbances during which prisoners were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with torrential floods.
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but this can happen at the beginning of the week, as the remains of Hurricane Rosa travel through the southwest desert, creating the risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floods on Monday and Tuesday in the territory of West Arizona to south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesdays, and Monday night will be rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
And Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of Arizona’s border.
According to the latest projections of the National Center of Hurricanes, the area of Mogolon Rome in Arizona is from 5.08 to 10.16 cm and places up to 15.24 cm of rainfall.
Other areas south-west of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of rainfall, possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of floods, Rose’s rain may be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
While floods are a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be useful, as the south-west is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Centre, a little over 40 percent of Arizona area suffers at least from extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, reportsweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to derailment on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in the force of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is located 620 km south of Punta Evgenia, Mexico, and moving north at 19.3 km per hour.
Storm meets with cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that in the case of a tropical storm during the day or in the evening of Monday, hurricanes will cause a shift in Mexico.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico may be significant, causing considerable risk of floods.
“The total rainfall from Lower California to Northwest Sonora is expected to range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm,” saysweather.com.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona and late Tuesday evening to southern Utah.
“The basic danger expected from Rose or her remains is the very heavy rain in Nizhni California, Northwest Sonora and Southwest American Desert, ” reports the National Centre of Hurricanes.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life - threatening floods and torrents of garbage in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton assault: four people arrested who attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
A wounded teenager was found in the Exelcior-Terras district in Midsomer-Norton about 4:00 hours after the British Standard Time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old men were arrested at night in the Radstock area, reported to Avon and Somerset police.
Police are asking everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Tramp says Cavanaugh “suffered to be mean and angry ” by the Democratic Party
"The voice behind Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a rally in Wilingu, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh had "feelings and anger" of the Democratic Party during the entire process of lifting.
Cavanaugh witnessed to Congress on Thursday, Thursday, in a heated and emotional objection to Christine Blaze Ford’s charge that he had committed sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness in her hearing about the charges.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage of Cavanaugh. ”
"The voice behind Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for one of the most advanced lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a flawless experience in public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president mentioned the withdrawal of Cavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the Republican appearance in the midterm elections.
"In five weeks there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
I am not running, but I am running, ” he said. —
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that the mission of Democrats was “to resist and obstruct”.
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavano will take place not later than Friday, reported the CNN assistant to one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people died from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, victims rising
At least 384 people were killed, many were washed away in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawese, declared the country’s power on Saturday.
Hundreds of people rested at a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) in twilight crashed by the shore, beating many to death and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami took place after an earthquake with 7.5 points.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and they didn’t start running away and they became victims,” said Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB).
"It wasn't just tsunamis, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the shoreline, the tsunami went through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 km/h).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerophotographs published by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are torn and destroyed, and mosques are surrounded by water.
The storms in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were found in the 2.4 million inhabitants of the region.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of the severe earthquake on Friday was 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the tsunami, the agency declared.
Nugrocho called the damage “widespread” and noted that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls, and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under wreckage of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that victims and injuries could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicentre.
"The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information from Donggala," Nugrocho said.
More than 300,000,000 people live there, says the Red Cross report, adding that his staff and volunteers left for the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get much bigger, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received extensive criticism for not saying that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials said that the waves had come at a time marked in a warning.
Amateur images shared by people on social networks show that a man on the top of the building shouts wild warnings of the tsunami on the street under construction.
A few minutes later, the water wall crashed into the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't check the actual footage immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a serious power disconnection, which has cut the connection around Palo, which has complicated the co-ordination of rescue.
Army officials began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, informed the authorities, but evacuees still need food and other essential items.
The city airport was opened only to help, and it would be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo had to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala got to the town of Palu, where they hide in the tarts set in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseb.
“They told me they had seen many destroyed houses,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief teams took decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign relief workers were not allowed to go to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, provision and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster is declared a zone of national disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
“ This is still a disaster at the province level, ” says Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but this status has not yet been granted."
The second night she came down to Pala after a Friday earthquake and a tsunami, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found were still hoping that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would adorn these grim plots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was picked up from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers received a woman who lay under a stone for two days along with her mother’s body.
Hendon Subandon, a coach of the Indonesian national team from paraplaneism, trained two missing paraplaneists to participate in the Asian Games earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanes trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandahi, were his disciples.
“As old as paraplaneism, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Mr. Hendon relates how a few hours after news of the destruction of Roa Roa Hotel, which spread among the paraplaneists, he desperately sent a message to Palu's WhatsApp rivals who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray branch, not double blue branches.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 when they filled the ATM at Newport on the Lefte
On Friday morning, the robbers stole $26,750 from Brink's employee, who operated a ATM at Newport on the Lefte, reports a news report to the Department of Police.
The driver of the car cleared the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man “went back to Brink’s coworker” and stole a bag of money to fill.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects who fled the crime scene in the news, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these persons should contact the NYPD at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Reper changes his name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced a change on Twitter, he wrote: “Before officially known as Kanye West”.
41-year-old Vesta was called E for a while, and he used it as a name for his June album.
The change took place the day before he appeared on the Saturday Night Live show, where he expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces Ariana Grande, who canceled her part for “emotional reasons, ” said the show’s author.
This is not just a reduction in the present professional name, but West used to say that the word had religious meaning for him.
"I believe "e" is the most widely used word in the Bible, and this means "you" in the Bible," West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with Big Boy Radio.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanye, which means "one" has been reduced to just "Y" -- just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deeddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, announced this year that he chose the name Love and Brasser Love.
Former colleague of West, DJ-ZI, also experimented with deficient and large letters.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico promises not to use an army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the massacre of students.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised to “never use an army to suppress the Mexican people” on the area of Tlatelolco.
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, and left student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to learners and by opening more free government universities.
He noted that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities have led young people to criminal groups.
US needs to double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this field, believes it's an investor and practice in the area of Shi Kai Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the S.I., although the U.S. does not have a formal strategy in the S.I.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become No. 1 by innovation in the XI sector by 2030.
"The double budget for the SII study would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in the SII," said Lee.
Double funding can double the probability that the next major achievement in the SII will be made in the U.S., said Lee in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Powers Shi: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was printed this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Synovation Ventures Foundation, who invested in Face++, one of the most famous Shia companies in China.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Mello, he was working on the XI system, which played the best American player at Otello, and later he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
Lee noted previous technology competitions conducted by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when they would be next to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, said Lee.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he noted.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring universities to work on Sls in recent years.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policies can also help the United States to increase efforts in the area of SCI.
"I believe that the Green Card should be automatically offered to the candidates of science in the XI sphere," he said.
China’s National Council published its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people who work in academic institutions, just as the National Science Fund and other U.S. government organizations give money to American researchers, while the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department created the Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee of artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in the SCI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, who wanted to create a Commission of National Safety of Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any steps in a few months.
Macedonians Vote in a Referendum on Change in Country Name
The people of Macedonia voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow a multi-annual dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia from membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, states that the northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory, and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the treaty claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether the voter appearance of the minimum 50% will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the ballot paper of the referendum is, “Do you support NATO and EU membership under the terms of acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
The name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that has formed since the break-up of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for the introduction of bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that it could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgevsk in Skopje.
Although the outcome of the vote is not legally binding, sufficient members of Parliament have said they would support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, two thirds of the vote will be required in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that by 1 p.m., there were no reports of violations.
However, only 16% of the vote was registered, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the elected voters threw their ballot papers into the ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old voters José Tanevski in Skopje's capital.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumice, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zayev of Macedonia, his wife Zorik and his son Dusko gave their vote in a referendum on a change in the name of the country, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
Before the Parliament in Skopje 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set the chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door," Kavardark said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev believes that NATO membership will bring many needed investments to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority vote for it, because more than 80% of our citizens speak for the EU and NATO," said Zayev after the vote.
He noted that the result “yes” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required requirement.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma, 57 percent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they'd vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be declared valid, the phenomenon must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first major blow to the politics of the pro-Western government since its start in May last year.
See: Serchio Aguero from Manchester City passes the entire defense of Brighton and kills the goal
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were defended by Brayton and won the Manchester City with a 2-0 count on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Gol Aguero at the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Bryton supporters and found himself in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four green ones.
He bypassed one defender, then circled a few more on the edge of the Brighton fine.
Then he made a pass to the left, when he saw Sterling.
The English foreyard made the first touch on the fine to give the ball to Aguero, who put his right butt on the right side of the gate, defeating the player "Britton" Matthew Ryan.
“Aguaro has some leg problems, ” said the magazine’s Siti manager, Pep Guardiola.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We're lucky he killed the goal at this point."
But the initial advantage of the sky blues in this Premier League match was to provide Sterling.
This goal took place at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful permeable pass along the left flank of Leroy Sané.
Leroy made a few touches and then made a trap for Sterling in the direction of the fart.
The Forward of the Sky Blues threw the ball at the gate just before he slipped outside.
Siti will meet Hoffenheim at 12:55 P.M. at the group stage of the League of Champions on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar-Aren Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants his glasses taken from Roquez.
Since the Washington Nashials team came out of playoff, there were no good reasons to wait for the launch.
But the Racer is looking forward to going to a pitcher's bitter Sunday at a match against Colorado Rocky, provided the Rockies are still having trouble getting out to play. Now Roques is playing one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
The Rockies at least have a Wild-Card victory with a score of 5-2 over the Nashionles on Friday night, but they're still trying to secure the title of the first division.
"Despite that we're playing for nothing, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how the viewers behave here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I've seen this whole year.
Why should I not want to participate in this contest?
The Nationals will announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they tend to be Sherzer.
Sherzer, for which it's going to be the 34th start, took a pitching session Thursday and could play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
The Washington right-hand side has a result of 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike cars at 220 2/3 inning this season.
Tramp rallies in West Virginia
The president mentioned the situation in the context of his candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the appearance of Republican supporters in mid-term elections.
"All that we have done will be placed on the map in November.
Five weeks from now, one of the most important choices in our lives will be held.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting for great candidates wherever I can," he said.
The Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they're strongly set to regain power by using any means, you see meanness, pest.
They don't care who suffers from them, who needs to go beyond it to get power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them."
The mission of Democrats, he said, “to stand up and prevent”.
"And you can see it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "evil and vile, disgusting and lying."
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling Senator-Democratic Diane Feynstein by his name, which provoked the audience to loud cries of discontent.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you give the document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was a really bad language for the bodybuilders -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When activists in my local party voted for me to be convicted, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the last of those Labouring Members to report that they are not happy, and all this because we are expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was almost like this because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policy in terms of national security for Europe, these issues are ironic like those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the meeting of the Labourers of Nottingham East says on Friday: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labourers were the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of a "more kind, softer" policy has long been forgotten if it ever began to be implemented.
It is becoming increasingly evident that there are no differing views in the Labour Party, and every thought is assessed from the point of view of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, colleagues with whom I had previously felt that I had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept a position with which I would never agree, whether national security or the only market of the EU.
Every time I speak publicly — and it doesn't matter what I say — it's followed by a parade of social networking attacks with calls to withdraw, a verdict from the center's politics, I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I've been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I've been given are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face daily streams of sexist or racist assaults but who never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that the levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and with each movement of mistrust or change of party selection rules narrows down.
During the last two years, I received a lot of advice, and I was urged not to get up, not to speak out so loud, that “everything was fine with me. ”
But that's not why I came to politics.
I joined the Labourers 32 years ago as a schoolboy because because of the lack of attention from the government of Tetcher, my high school class has literally collapsed, and since then I want to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, be they the local adviser or minister of government.
I have never concealed my politics, including in my last election.
No one in Nottingham East was troubled by my political views and differences with current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: if the country goes to Brexith, which would harm households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have one more message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, both the Labour Party and not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that there are no threats to recall me and no political advantage will prevent me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Air rises up
The last two attempts may have distorted the final result, but no doubt the Air has earned a triumph in today's great entertainment match of the Premiership of Scotland.
Now they're leading the table, that's the only insurmountable team out of ten.
After all, excellent defense and improved ability to use the opportunity gives Peter Merci the masters and coach the full right to be content.
"We've been testing our games so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be content," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, "I give up the proper Air," they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute drive, implemented by Frazier Clemo, led Air forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, released by Verryors, allowed Melrose to show the figures, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo strengthened the Air leadership with a penalty and made and implemented a solo trial just before the break, which cost 17-5 in favour of Air.
But Melrose had a good start in the second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, carried out by Baggot, had reduced the break to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay due to the serious trauma of Ruard Knott, who was taken out of the field on his prowl, and the Air reboot broke forward with the attempt by Stafford McDowell, which was carried out by Clemo.
Captain Air then had a yellow card, and then Melrose again forced another player to pay for Bruce Colvin's unfulfilled attempt under intense pressure.
The masters returned, but when Strong Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting the Klimo without a ball from the finer's line, McFerson made a touchdown behind Air's mole.
Klimo attempted to do what he did almost every time after the reboot, then Kyle Row got a hit from David Armstrong in the box and sent flanger Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the team of the hosts.
Looks like the star of the "All Still Game" series is set for a new career in the restaurant sphere
It seems like the star of the "All Still Game" Ford Kiran is set up for a new career in hospitality, and that's a conclusion to be made after it's become known that he's the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in a popular BBC TV show that he writes a script that he's doing with a long-time comedy partner named Greg Hemfill.
Duet announced that the future of the ninth series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craig.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "beautiful restaurant business".
"Our Sea": Intra-uterine Bolivia expects the court to open its way to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang an ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a motto: “Our sea is right.
We must return it.”
In Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline, which left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century because of natural resources, and there is a desire to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades now, as Bolivia is awaiting the international court ruling on October 1st after five years of handling the case.
“There is momentum in Bolivia, there is a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, there is a positive outcome,” commented Roberto Kalsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, and they hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia that after decades of brief discussions Chile will force the negotiations to give Bolivia a sovereign way out to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic root president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his re-election in the following year, also has high hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if that happens, little will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to condemn the Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The decision of the ICJ, taken only six months after the final arguments were cited, indicates that the case “was not complex”, said Pass Zaraté, a Chilean expert in international law.
The case of Bolivia has not moved forward, and for the past four years, it has been possible to backfire.
"The drinking of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration," Zarat said.
The war - torn rhetoric of Morales blew up the remains of Chilean kindness, which she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree that court ruling was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will receive “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to put an end to 139 years of differences, benefiting each other, ” he said.
Kalsadia also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never abandon its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This decree is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo seemed on the verge of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which had entered a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen In.
Rei says that faith in the fact that the continuation of the sanctions and opposition of the United States to the end of the Korean war will someday put North Korea on its knees is “an unreal dream”.
Washington is afraid to accept a declaration before Pyongyang makes significant strides in disarmament.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that the Phoenician takes seriously the rejection of his arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Tram.
On the Paris fashion show, the latest trend of massive main equipment is already on the main streets of your city.
If you want to expand your hat collection or hide from the sun completely, you've found what you need.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of eccentric main outfits in the style of the spring-summer 2019 over the stage of a brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats were filled with Instagram this summer, and the famous designers have already sent their breathtaking creations beyond the stage.
Valentino was decorated with an extravagant beige hat with wide ornamented feathers of fields that closed the heads of models.
Among other things, the ancestry-exposures are adorned with precious stones of coffee, a witch hat and even a pineapple hat, but they're not to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the range of the original masks — very timely before Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had lips sewn up and more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled underwater swim gears with tubes and spectacles, and another looked like a piece of ice cream that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylish people say huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
The Overseech Hats came in fashion thanks to La Bomby, a straw hat with fields of width of 60 centimeters, which everyone saw: from Rianne to Emily Ratajkovski.
A cult brand behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks has given the world another creation: a straw beach bag about the size of almost like a model in a bathing suit that was carried by it.
The bag of yellowish red raffia with raffia and white leather handle was a central element of the collection La Riviera spring-summer 2019 Jacques on the Paris weekly fashion brand.
Luke Armitage’s celebrity stylist told FEMAIL: “The next summer I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the cities, because the designer’s influence is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for ovesis accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge as Responsibilities to the Citizens of the World
The independent schools of Scotland support high standards of learning, and in 2018 they again received excellent results of examinations that are complemented by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, U.S.A., and they seek to provide the best service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, careers chosen by them, and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject for school choices.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language she understands, he understands it in his mind.
If you speak to her in her mother tongue, she takes it with her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's exam show that independent schools of language are the best rated subjects.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received higher A.
Data gathered at 74 schools in the Czech Republic showed that 72% of students received a higher grade A from Chinese and 72% from German students, 69% from French students, and 63% from Spanish students also received A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Language is now taught in the same way as NTIM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), in independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close vacancies related to lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for a future career.
Since more and more promising positions require knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if someone learns a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages the advantage of competitors.
According to a survey conducted by more than 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, while French was the only language spoken by ambiguous people (15%).
That is why the investment in language teaching is now important to children today.
Learning a few languages, especially those of developing countries, will provide more opportunities for children to find a full - time job.
In Scotland each school will learn their own language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important to Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, several languages can always be chosen to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools try to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now we can't deny that in the international business environment, languages continue to be vital to the future country, so it has to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be seen as “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity, and perfection to Scottish youths.
Il faut bien only ferre.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debuting from Lakers in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James' first launch for Los Angeles Lakers are almost waiting.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would be playing Sunday in the first pre-season match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
For how long he'll be playing, it's not decided yet.
"This will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, reported that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of the Lakers pre-season chart.
"At this point in my career to prepare, I don't need pre-season games," he replied.
Trampa rallies in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of pre-election rallies from the city of Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled for the next week of the Trump rally, including rallys in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy proposed by him to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump seeks to form support for the upcoming midterm elections, since the Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will be the evening rally of Trump in West Virginia, and how can we view it on the Internet?
A rally of Trump in Wiling, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours in Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch a Trump rally in West Virginia online down on YouTube.
Tramp may refer to the strain of hearings that took place this week in connection with a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh, accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate's vote a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans get popular before the November elections.
President Tramp's representatives stated that these five rallies next week were aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
“Congress control is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tense season of the campaign is approaching,” said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign who did not want to name his name.
Today’s rallies from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh, report West Virginia Metro News, can arrive at the session of the Wesbanko Arena Stadium in Wiling.
Saturday's visit will be the second in the last month of a visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morris, whose ratings are lagging behind the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morris that the president is coming to raise his ratings in polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Raider Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and full of hopes ahead of Sunday's singles
After three sessions, which ended with a unilateral victory, Saturday’s forts could become just what this Ryder Cup lacked.
An impulsive pendulum is a well - designed sports concept that players really believe in, especially at similar games.
So, when will they say the impulse is working?
"They were six points ahead, and now four points, so I think we're taking it a little as a impulse," said Jordan Spit when he walked in.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead and another twelve points in the game.
The Americans, Speed says, feel a little wind in their sails, and also are encouraged by many, not least by the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each made three out of four points.
A sleep with his killer punches from the mat to the green shows an example.
These larynx shrieks of celebration became louder when, in the continuation of his round, he made the decisive path and compared the score to the fourth match after he and Thomas were separated by two points.
His patent, which allowed them to win a 15-seat match, met a similar scream, one that tells you that the American team doesn't seem to.
"You really should just try hard and worry about your own match," said Spit.
That's all any of these players left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder’s Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't make the gods on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid the gods on Saturday morning and after lunch on Friday and at nine last holes on Friday morning.
This race and how their energy seems to flow to this boisterous crowd and back, makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players but Fleetwood or Molinari to consolidate the potential victory of Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Both are desired in different holes at the same time.
However, talking about the triumph of Europeans in the early days.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson broke up with Sergio García, the hero of the morning forums when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One god and two dahls at the first nine holes brought a Spaniard and a Swede to a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe the forums and foresoms closely because of the interaction between the participants in the couple, because of the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and also to see how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe is playing better than a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of forcems has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight what some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe is in charge of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
The final day of the Kubuk Ryder Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's forks and fors, it is ahead of the United States with the score of 10-6.
The inspired duet Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the lagging Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to bring back the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forks with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. has made greater resistance in the force and won two matches, but failed to shorten the breakup.
Commandi Jim Furik needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fletwood, the first European novice to win four points in a row, and he and Mollinari (with Mollywood) after a sensational weekend are just the second couple who scored four points in the first four matches in the history of Ryder's Cup.
By crushing Woods and Patrick Reid in the forboles, they are united to win a fat Woods and a new American named Bryson Desambo with an even more effective 5th.4.
Woods, who pulled two matches out on Saturday, demonstrated a random burst of genius, but at the moment he lost 19 of his 29 matches in the forks and forsomas and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning forts, returned to his partner, Henrik Stanson, in the forsomals, to win a 2-1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, who are the first and third in the world rating.
Europe has not been able to do anything in its own way this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris.
Three times Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, the top winner, set the standard for the Americans with their two points.
They won a decisive 2-1 victory over the Spaniards, John Ram and Ian Paulter in the forts, and later they beat Pauler and Rory McLroy with a score of 4th in the forsomals, losing two first holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubko Ryder the team returned with a four-point deficit in the singles, although the Furika team needs nothing to save the trophy.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks like they're out of power.
North Korea says that “no way” will be disarmed unilaterally without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the UN on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions deepened mistrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country would never be able to renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Young Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had used “substantial measures of goodwill” in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear test site and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a proper response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will by no means be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s “popular” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for its progressive steps, his statement proved to be important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization done by Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Ein and Donald Trump on the first ever summit between the real president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea yearned for the formal end of the Korean War between 1950 and 53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang must first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists calls to weaken the hard international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is insisting on "denuclearization first" and raising the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal violently, and even denying the "declaration of the end of war", said Ri.
“The belief that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unfulfilled dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Tram, which the U.S. leader emphasized at the UN at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Zhee In in the last five months and added: “If a party to the denuclearization issue were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have gone to such a dead end”.
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's performance was very different from last year's when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim "a human rocket" who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, at UN Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for the courage to use disarmament efforts, but said that much more would be needed and sanctions should remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump observed that he did not set a time frame for it: “It would take two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter”.
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and steadily until we see a complete, final, confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block funding for nuclear programmes and missile ballistics.
Pompeo met Ri in the bullets of the UN General Assembly and then said that the next month he was going to visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented on progress, but after hours North Korea sentenced him to "gangster requirements".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “measures to do”.
He told us that, according to Kim, he needed the "appropriate measures" that Trump promised in Singapore and the steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all of his students with more sleep, an attempt to combat a growing culture of crotch learning all night after a caffeine filling.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham Women’s Hospital, developed a course that he thought was the first such course in the United States.
He decided to initiate the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, one girl approached him and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in the last class?"
“She told her that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me, ” a teacher from The Telegraph said.
This year’s first course explains how good sleep habits help students to achieve academic and sporting outcomes, as well as to improve their overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the university, told us that the university decided to take a course after it was found that the students had been seriously deprived of sleep for a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dorm room where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficits on sports performances, and the importance of sleep routines.
In another chapter, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Chasesler.
The culture of pride for “sleep all night” still exists, he added, and noted that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality should be the “secret weapon” of a student to deal with stress, burnout and anxiety, even with a set of extravagance, since the deprivation of sleep is a means of driving the brain into hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he related.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasesler develop the course after taking one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he expects, will be to appeal to all postgraduate students to go through a similar training program before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chasesler recommends that students be reminded that you should go to bed and also set the alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights and that you might be able to break the circadian rhythm that causes problems with sleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengi goal upsets Gerard's boys
The Rangers survived the attack on their exit grief: Dolly Menga's hit brought Stephen Gerard's separate team down 1-0 from Livingstone.
The ABROX team wanted to win its first victory in a 18-game exit match after a February triumph over St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard as a 18-game manager. Gerard's team remained eight points behind Scottish Prime Minister Harts' leaders.
Menga killed seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers warehouse, which lacked inspiration, did not look as if it could equal the score.
Now the Rangers are down to sixth position, and Livingstone is up to third, and they're only ahead of Hibernian by the difference of the ball.
In addition, Rangers may encounter another unpleasantness, since Linsman Kalum Spence was forced to handle a head wound after he was thrown into the guest sector with an object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, which once passed by Air in the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same "Live 11", which took one point at Harts last week, and was thrilled by the way his extorted boys pushed their opponents at each step.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone worked more with the ball.
They were going to kill only two minutes of the game when the first Menga pass into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gates of Allan McGregor, but the half-protector wasted this great chance by sending the ball past the gate.
A deep free kick by Keagan Jacobs was made by Craig Halket's skipper, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, hit the backstabbing.
Rangers actually got control, but there was more hope in the last third than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should be given a penalty on the mark of a quarter of an hour after his encounter with Stephen Lawless, but Stephen Thomson’s referee rejected a Colombian appeal.
Rangers managed to do only two punches on the gate in the first time, but Liam Kelly's former goalkeeper, who was the head of Lassani Kulibali, and the calm impact of Ovije Ejaria, was hardly disturbed.
Although the cross-breeding goal of Lingstone for 34 minutes may have been at odds with the progress of the game, no one can deny that they only earned it by their hard work.
Rangers failed to manage the Jacobs plant again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Mengo for a simple conclusion.
At a break, Gerrad replaced the Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the change almost immediately worked when the veneer tried to reach Morelos, but the striking Kelly pulled off his line to block it.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play exactly the kind of game they liked when Lithgo and Chalket make one long pass after another.
Holt's team may have improved the results at the last stages, but McGregor was very much opposed to Jacobs before Lithgo struck from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he faced Jacobs, but Thompson looked again.
Almanac: Geiger's inventor
And now the page from our Almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time is coming... a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hance" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
From then on Geiger became one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of culture, for example, in the 1950s "Call the Coronado" with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play questionable cowboy-scientists.
Man: “What is this all about?”
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear how the atoms are affected by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "Well, it's really cracking!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
Vaccina teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method involves removing the immune cells in the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then these cells can see proteins, which are common to many cancers, and then these cells reintroduce the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results for patients with various cancers.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has lost more than 18 months of ovarian cancer.
The method involves removing the immune cells into the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” together for many types of protein cancer (HER2) and then reintroducing them to the patient.
Professor J. Berzofski of the U.S. National Cancer Institute Betesda, Maryland, observed: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several cancers", including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells in patients and “teaching ” them to target cancer cells, worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
After the SNL show appeared in the MAGA Kanye West baseball studio, he tapped with a sharp speech to support President Trump,
and caused a negative reaction from the audience
The audience in the studio of the SNL show (Saturday night on live air) cheered Kanye after his summary performance, during which he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and declared that he would be running for the presidency in 2020.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, in baseball with the title "Let's Return the American Past Glory," he burst out with a tyranny in which he criticized the Democrats, and again claimed his support of the Trump.
"Sometimes during the conversation, white people ask me, "How do you like Trump, but he's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show was launched by Matt Deemon's sketchboard, in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Cavanaugh, who he gave to the Senate Legal Committee on Christine Blaze Ford's sexual assault suit.
Although Vesta was not broadcast live, Chris Rock's social media video was posted on the social media.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to mock Vesta by putting this post in place.
Vest also complained to the audience that he was in a state of trouble because of his headgear.
According to a Washington Examiner publication, West said, "When I was behind the scenes, I was rudely treated.
They told me, "Don't go out to the audience in this baseball."
They were bullying me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed keep quiet."
The news continued, "You want to see a place where the oppressed keep quiet?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the weekly Variety, his comments were at least twice as bad as the audience in the hall, and SNL actors looked confused, and one of the viewers said, "The studio had a dead silence."
In the last minute, the newspaper was invited to replace Ariane Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Macmiller, died a few days before the air.
The news caused many surprises by performing the song I Love it (I love it) in the Perrier water bottle suit.
The Vest supported TPUUSA Kendez Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the boldest, thank you for standing up against NATO."
Instead, the show leader Karen Gunter wrote on Twitter that West is who he is, and that's just great.
"But I'm NOT going to reward (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art of art) who, in my opinion, adheres and excruciates the ideology that is damaging to my community.
He's a free man.
So do we," she added.
Before the show, a rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name: now he's "the one who used to be known as Kanye Vest."
The West is not the first performer to change his name, but it follows the example of Grandpa, also known as Puff Grandfathery, Puffy and Paddy.
Snoop Dogg's colleague was known as Snoop Lyon, and it's known that the musical legend of the last decades of Prince's life has changed his name to a symbol, and then he became "Artist, formerly known as Prince."

The prosecution will consider the charges.
Star of the "Game of Thrones" by Keith Garington condemns the idealization of brutality
Kit Gerrington became famous for the role of a soldier with the sword of Jon Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "The Game of Thrones" of HBO's production.
However, a 31-year-old actor who condemned the character-macho stereotyping, claiming that because of these characters on the screens, young boys often feel that they have to become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that he thought something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of idealization of brutality in the era of the popularity of hestega #MeTo (#estak, #scene, etc.).
Keith, who recently married his colleague at the Game of Thrones, 31-year-old actor Rose Leslie, pointed out that he was "very determined" to deal with this problem.
"I'm quite determined at the moment, when did we get on the slippery path of idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach prospective men if we look at their adulthood because of the prism of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality because of the very courageous characters.
He went on to say, "What's natural, and what are they planting?
Why does TV and the street teach that young men feel pressure to be such men?
I think today is really an important question, "How can we change this?"
It's obvious that young boys have strayed from the right path."
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any of the prequels and Sicvelles of the "Games of Thrones" after the end of the series next summer, because he had already finished fighting with horses and battles.
From November, Keith will play the song "The True West" by Sam Shepard -- a story about a movie producer and his brother a robber.
As an actor recently confessed, he considers meeting with his wife Rose the best he's gotten from participating in the Game of Thrones.
"After the filming in this series I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life," said Keith.
In a fantasy show that got the Emmy Award, Rose played the Yigrit, the love of the Herrington Jon Snow hero.
The couple got married in June 2018, the ceremony took place on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China claims a 14% increase in new cases
In China, 14 percent of the population with HIV and AIDS reported sharp increases.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 patients per country.
In just the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, indicating a change in the past trend.
For a long time, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to officials from the health authorities during the conference held in the province of Yunnan, the number of people infected by HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
Compared with the previous year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HlV over time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT society often suffers from discrimination.
According to studies, 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sex with other men are still married to women because of national conservative values.
The transmission of disease in most cases results from improper use of protective devices during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, seeing in part the solution in this way.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of republishing senators on the network by her regular employee and has been severely criticized by "hazardous lie" and "Conflict Theory"
On Saturday, U.S. Chamber of Representatives Maxine Waters denounced voice statements that one of her staff staff had posted personal data to three US Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat in Los Angeles claims that these statements promote ultra-right political viewers and websites.
"The belly, the lie, and then even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published information is reported to have house addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch of Utah.
Data appeared online on Thursday, and was posted by an unknown person from Capitolia during the Senate hearings on charges of sexual assault against Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court judge.
The leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavano.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the source was linked to the Waters office and that it was followed by a staff member.
"These groundless claims are absolutely false, they don't correspond to reality," Waters continued.
"A staff member of my office whose personal data and security are threatened by these fabricated and false statements has nothing to do with leaking this information.
These groundless claims are absolutely false, they don't match reality."
Waters was quickly criticized online, and among others was former White House Spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that with this nature she cannot be a member of Congress.
When accused of what he did not do, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not be presumptuous.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and insolent."
It seems that Fleischer held parallels between Waters' reaction and the criticism of Democrats at Judge Kavano's address, accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republican Party, who is working to take the Waters position as a result of the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion in Twitter.
"That's the news, if all is really true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had already informed "the relevant public authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these false claims."
"We'll do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they've answered the law for their actions which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of the film "Agent Johnny English: New Mission" is a passing parody for spy militants with Rowen Atkinson.
Now it's a good tradition to look at every new British movie that Brexit invented, and in the new part of a series of comedy parades for Johnny Ingles. The first film called "Johnny English" was released back in 2003, and later re-enacted in 2011, with "Johnny English: Restart."
Will it become a ridiculous-ironic self-sainting on what we are impeccable, new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Ingleish with his moving face and his blighted eyes got a second chance to make a mess, with his name more than anything else pointing out that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As we know, Johnny is a funny secret agent who, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, is a little bit from Inspector Clouseau, a little bit from Mr. Bean and a lot of things, from the guy who played one note of the movie "Fire Wheels" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The character is also foreshadowed by the traveller and mystery of the international scale that has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in the long - forgotten television commercial of Barclaycard.
In the last movie about Johnny Inglesa, there are a few good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Ingles in the knights ’ gears approached the helicopter, and the screw shovels gave him his helmet.
There's a great talent in the film that Atkinson has to do with the boofonade, but the humor is too much, and at some point it's too much, especially when it compares to the "serious" movies, such as "Agent 007" and "mission impossible," one of the ingredients that is also a comedy.
It seems to me that jokes are more designed for children than adults, and I find it absurd to attack Johnny Ingleishe as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson's wits in silent movies about Bein.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
In the British supersecret network of spies, the hacker penetrates and exposes the names of all field agents, which became a complete surprise to the operative (alas, Kevin Eldon played only an episode role in the film).
This turned out to be the last drop of the prime minister, a proud person who had already suffered a devastating criticism and was in deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to best convey the image inspired by Theresa May, but the script failed to fully reveal it).
Intelligence officials informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she had to get someone from behind.
The choice falls on the clumsy Johnny Ingleisha, who now works as a teacher in some supermodern institution and unofficially teaches children to work under cover (in this part with spy school of the year in English for teenagers there were several good jokes).
Inglesa is quickly shipped to Whitegol for an emergency briefing, where he meets again with his long - suffering friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller on the turn.
Baff is now married to the captain of a submarine (the role of an exasperated abominable person does not exactly match Vicky Pepperdin’s talent).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went off, "Betman and Robin" went back into line and suddenly met the fatal woman Ophelia Pistol, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at that time, the prime minister is being charmed by a charismatic billionaire who has earned his fortune in the field of technology and technology and claims that he can solve the problem with the British network, Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lacey.
Inglesz and Baff are going on a journey and are again resorting to their ridiculous excuses: dressed as waiters, they fire in a fancy French restaurant; they are still sowing chaos by illegally going abroad on Volta's luxury yacht; English is having a real mess when they try to use a helmet of virtual reality to get acquainted with the planning of Volt's house.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his kindness and madness, he resembles a movie for the children.
It's a passing film.
As I looked at other movie stars about Johnny Ingleisha, I asked myself the same question: Can the British film industry not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The Leiborists deny the plan that the British will work four days a week, but will get paid in five days.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, has to discuss a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but they will get paid in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige the company leaders to transfer the funds saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, to the employees, giving them an extra weekend.
So the workers will have a three - day weekend and will bring home the same salary.
Sources report that this idea will respond to the party’s economic program and direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The four-day working week shift was approved at the British Trade Union Congress, and it is seen that workers will be able to benefit from changing the overall economic situation.
The source of the Labour Party reported to The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It won't change in one night, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Leiborists were not the first to approve such an idea, since the Green Party had promised to set up a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party currently approve of such a desire.
Speaker of the Leiborist Party said, "The party's political program does not provide for a four-day working week, so now we're not considering this idea."
"The Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election meeting of the Labour Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was set to take back power from the "devil directors" of utilities and "requirers".
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that water companies' shareholders may not get all their share of capital if the Labour Government introduces "counting" on the basis of perceived violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include employees in company management and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of ordinary shares to private sector firms that are expected to receive annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about in the 60 Minutes show (60 minutes) whether investigating the Cavanaugh case running the FBI can change their mind.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh, who is leading the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as Supreme Court Judge has been postponed at least a week, raises the question of whether the Republican Senators will continue to support Kavano after the Bureau's investigation has been published.
On Sunday's 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.-
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the charge came out, and he asked him, "Did you really do it?
He was firm, uncompromising, uncompromising."
It seems that Graham's idea will not change anything.
"I believe that bringing out the Cavanaugh charges is provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, addressing Christine Blasie Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm that under oath.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York, will be hosted by the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and at least an amazing mission to overcome poverty worldwide.
During the 7th Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will go to the Grand Galina of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real purpose of the festival, organizers are eager to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international community organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (if you don't want to pay the VIP ticket), visitors have to do a series of tasks or "acts" like learn in a volunteer project, write an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else to help bring attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So is there any result, since the organizers of Global Citizen have 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is it really the idea to reward for doing a free concert -- a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "lictivism" when people feel they really change something by signing an electronic petition or doing a Twitter publication?
According to Global Citizens, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "actions" of their adherents aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization states that these actions have led world leaders to claim planned financial support and programs worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group set an example of the results of its 390 financial commitments and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group, the cost has already directly affected the lives of some 649 million people around the world.
The main financial commitments include the Fund of The Power of Nutrition (Food Power), which is territorially related to Britain, and the Investors and Realizers have committed themselves to "help children grow" and have pledged $35 million in support of Rwanda to overcome malnutrition after receiving over 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, the centenarians, governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make the social problem of undernourished with a minor fact of history," said the representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman, speaking before the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "actions" that called for improving maternal and child nutrition, the British government announced a budget allocation for the The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your web site, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens wrote, "It's a long and difficult way, so sometimes we'll fall and fail.
However, like civil rights and apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, the band The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janell Mona, is just a part of the star performers that will be performing this year at the New York Festival, and will be celebrated by Deborah-Lee Fernès and Guy Jackman.
Interior Minister stated that the United States could use Navy to prevent Russian energy exports
According to U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington may turn to the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates on the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to become a broker in the energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"With the help of the U.S. naval forces, it can provide free passage through maritime routes and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, which was hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance (the Alliance of Energy Consumers), a non-profit organization that would position itself as the "voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He then compared trade approaches with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace it with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "singlely developed" because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these claims were echoed, the Trump administration sought to increase exports of compressed natural gas to Europe by draining Russian origin from the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
For this purpose, the Trampa administration officials and President Donald Trump themselves are trying to convince the German government to abandon the "indefinite" construction project of the "North Stream 2" which, according to Trampa, will make Berlin hostage Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that North Stream 2 is worth $11 billion and doubles the capacity of an existing gas station to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin convinces us that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and the consumer should be able to select suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position sparked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organisation of the Federal Union of German Industry (BDI) called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like the third country involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Union of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" about running for president in 2020.
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" about running for the presidency after the midterm election.
During a public meeting in the city of Goliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering raising her candidacy.
According to The Hill Warren, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and get the government working, and there has to be a woman on his forehead."
"After the 6th of November, I will seriously consider moving my candidacy to the presidency."
During her encounter with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation for the presidency of Donald Trump, stating that he was "leading his country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank, criticizing the Trump and offering him a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Cavanaugh.
Warren wrote in Friday's tweet, "...of course, the FBI has to investigate before the vote."
However, according to a Friday poll, most Warren voters do not think that it should be in 2020.
According to a poll conducted jointly by the Center for Political Studies of the University of Safffolk and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts objected to the removal of their candidacy as senator.
Thirty - two percent supported the displacement.
The results of the survey showed that the former Governor, Deval Patrick, was more supportive, and 38 percent opposed to 48% for his potential removal to the presidency.
During the discussions, other well-known Democrats who can run in 2020 are also known as former Vice President Joe Baden and a senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make his decision by January.
Sarah Paylin mentions the PTSD Trek Paylin during a rally to support Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Paylin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident occurred on Monday night.
"What my son is going through right now, which is what he's going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers are returning home," she told the rally participants in support of Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called the arrest of Trek "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "return home not as they used to be, more cruel, and want to know if what their fellow soldiers, pilots and other military personnel have done here for this country."
According to a spokesman in the State Department of Vassilla, Dan Bennett, Treka was arrested on Monday in Vassilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as with obstructing a report of violence and carrying a weapon of alcohol abuse.
18 states and county of Colombia support complaints by asylum-giving politicians
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support the recrimination of the new U.S. policy, which has resulted in the denial of refugee status by victims of gang persecution and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note to the court in Washington to support a suit requiring asylum and to appeal against the policy in question.
The full name of the challenger in the "Grace vs. Seshns" case under the American Union's motion for the protection of civil rights, in which federal policy has been appealed and which was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The defendant claimed that her partner "and his cruel sons-bandits" had beaten her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20th.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
Government prosecutors supporting Grace's lawsuits stated that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemalans (frequently asked for asylum in the United States) often face such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status reverses the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, according to which undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence could seek refuge.
District Attorney General Carl Reasin stated during his speech on Friday that the new policy "ignors decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal law requires that decisions on applications for refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances of the application and that the prohibition violates this principle," says the court's analyst note.
The prosecutor's report further suggests that the policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States is damaging the economy of the country, because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill up the necessary labour resources".
In June, Attorney - General Jeff Seshns issued an order to immigration judges that they could no longer grant refugee status to fugitives from domestic violence and banditry.
"The shelter is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," Ceshns said during the presentation of politics on June 11.
Giving refuge was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately try to find those who are still alive, while the number of dead in Palu has doubled.
For those who have survived, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with fever at the evacuation center of the destroyed town of Palu.
"Each minute quick help brings bodies.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people return to their devastated homes, take away the smoldering goods, and try to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake whose strength amounted to 7.5 on the Richter scale are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including two Geris with a break in his back and shoulder, rest at the building of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are provided with open - air assistance because of repeated repeated impulses.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled the strong push of the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I'm stuck in the middle of a wreckage of the wall," said Garis to an Associated Press reporter, adding that he and his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, and then held her peace.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador blames China for the "realization of psychological pressure" with "relatives that contain propaganda"
A week after the state newspaper of China placed advertising material on the four pages of the American daily publication on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States referred last Wednesday to China Daily’s Payable Edition in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, following China’s indictment of attempts to influence the Congress, which will take place on November 6th, China rejects these charges.
According to Reuters officials in the United States, Trump's allegations that he accuses Beijing of trying to intervene in American elections mean a new phase of Washington's escalation, the pressure on China.
Although foreign governments may place commercial advertising to boost trade, there is an escalation in the trade war between Beijing and Washington, where they have already increased customs imports.
Experts from China and the United States believe that early in this war, the establishment of a reprisal myth in China was intended to strike exporters from such states as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brandted, a US Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa State, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Bransted wrote in the column of the Sunday release of Des Moines Register, "strengthens the pressure by publishing an advertisement containing propaganda in our independent press."
"For spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and the independence of the press by putting a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," wrote Bransted.
"On the contrary, on the street tables here in Beijing, you will find only the individual voices of the dissidents, and here you will not see the true reflection of what the Chinese people actually think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is causing concern, from which you can conclude that the media in China are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the most respected Chinese publications proposed to publish" his article, but he did not say which one.
Analysts warn that by failing Kavano, Republicans are setting women voters against themselves before intermediate elections.
Since many prominent Republicans support and protect the candidate for the post of Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavano after he has been framed with several charges of sexual harassment, analysts warn that this could cause an unwanted reaction in the eve of future midterm elections, especially for women.
The situation is rife with passion, and most Republicans publicly claim that they would like to go to the polls.
Such things can then not just be played back," said The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Riger, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse.
Ruger doubted that the FBI investigation, at which Senator Jeff Flake (Arrison Republican) was pressing in the last minute, would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Washington, D.C.," chief adviser and spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, Catherine Jean-Perrye said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning protestors sang "The November Approach!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee when the Republicans decided to move to the Kavano candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
In an interview with Steu Rotenberg's news website, a non-party political observer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it's true now, and it's true.
However, motivation can increase, especially for women voters from 18 to 29 years of age with a front line that has not yet been defined and often voted if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford testified on charges against a candidate for the Supreme Court's office in sexual crimes, analysts predicted a negative reaction from the voters if the Republicans insisted on approval.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steel, stated: "This is a unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
In an interview with the news channel, Hay Cecil, Director of the U.S. Priorities, said, "the matter is not in the vote of the committee, the final vote or the fact that Kavano was in the custody of the defendants, but in the way they reacted to the situation and how they acted."
However, the American mind on whose testimony to believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, has been divided.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or believe more quickly in Ford’s testimony, while Cavanaugh’s testimony believes or believes 35% more quickly.
In addition, 38 percent of those polled noted that Kavanaugh believed that he was giving or was more likely to give false testimony, while 30 percent of those surveyed said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after Flake's insistence, the FBI conducts investigations into the charges filed by Ford and another challenger, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford gave a witness under oath by the Senate Legal Committee about how Cavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 when she was drunk.

World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a "new Internet" to create Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the worldwide Internet, launches a new startup to create Facebook, Amazon, and Google competition.
The latest project of technology legend, the Inrupt company, is developing an open-source platform with Solid, the idea of Berners-Li.
With a Solid user platform, users can choose where to store data and who to give access to information.
In the exclusive interview of Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of Inrupt was "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said about the startup.--
It's a historic moment."
Solid technology is used to allow users to create "personal online data repository" or SD.
It contains contact lists, lists of current cases, calendars, audio recordings library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify at the same time in one browser.
A unique feature of this personal online data repository is that it fully responds to the needs of a user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities through data."
According to the director - general of Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to activate resources, processes, and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
At present, the company consists of Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased at IBM, several state-owned developers hired to work on the project, and volunteer communities.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee claimed that he and his team didn't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to replace them completely when all their business models had undergone radical changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday's publication on Medium Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt was "to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created by the Solid platform."
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet by setting up a World Spider Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Burners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate about net neutrality.
Even during its launch, Inrupt Burners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of networking," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commemoration of the Church of the Order of the Cross Victoria during World War I
The only representative of the Church of England who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for his participation in the fighting during World War I is honored in his home town after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for the attack on Belangzi and Leocour on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper’s bullet and never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military prize.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, described as "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through the St. Katen channel "through a very thick fog and under the thick fire of field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the fiery border and with his "disquiet bravery" led the line forward, before one broke into the field cannon and destroyed the three cannons of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918 -- a little over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather had done something he could never have done himself and deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, placed a crown after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very proud of what's going on in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero shows him the respect that so many people show him."
Fans of MMA didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead, they were shown "Peppa Lead"
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to see the event saturated by the Bellator 206, and you're denied the opportunity to review the main event.
The tournament’s posters, held in San José, included 13 fights, including six main programs broadcast live overnight in Britain on channel 5 of the main program.
At 6: 00 a.m., just before Gegard Moussasi and Rory McDonald were ready to meet together, TV in Britain died of surprise when a Peppa pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting.
Some viewers were not thrilled because they did not sleep until the morning, waiting for a fight.
One of the fans wrote in Twitter that a switch to a child's cartoon seemed to him "somethough a joke."
"According to the government's decree of content, which was broadcast at 6 a.m., it was inappropriate, so they were forced to play a child transfer," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Public Relations Bellator, when asked about television,
Pig Peppa, yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Coker has promised to work on a broadcast schedule to include audiences in Britain in the future.
"I think if we talk about recasting, we can arrange it," said Coker.
"But now it's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we answered, and the text was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to eliminate it.
It turned out, however, that this was not the same as government decrees.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to shorten the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we've been trying to send a signal to the fans, but so far, we've postponed these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper in the water, Tom Daley, tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that "not everyone looked like him" until he went to high school.
As he participated in the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lawrne, he noted that he openly spoke of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also claimed that parenthood has made him less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The manager, who has been running this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
Coming in as a couple for the first Laverne program, Daley said he felt worse than others when he was a kid, because "the community didn't take it for granted when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "So far, the sense of less value and difference was just what gave me strength and strength to succeed."
He said he was trying to prove that something was guarded so as not to disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
A two-time bronze Olympic prize has become a prominent advocate for the rights of LGBT communities and has taken advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke frankly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
The three - time champion of the world admitted that his feelings for the man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, had become a real surprise to him.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much at this age" (at the first Olympics he performed at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also survive similar fits and falls.
In June, a married couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and since then, according to Daley, his "acceptance" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would think only of what gold should be gained," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named Robert's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said that his father could not accept the thought of the end and asked before his death whether they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be sitting in the front row because you won't be around anymore," said Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I knew it was what he had dreamed of all his life: the dives before his fellow countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that," said Daley.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – the Proud, in the performance of Giser Small – which resonated with him during the preparation of the Olympic Games still calls for ants.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 in English summer time.
On Saturday, from the tournament match, the Ryder Cup was released by Michelson, who wasn't in shape.
American Phil Michelson set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game in a "Rider's Box" tournament, but he has to reinstate the form so that this event doesn't become an unhappiness event for him.
Michelson's record 12th time in a two-year tournament came out of the game of Captain Jim Furick during the Forbols and Forsams.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner cheered up the team all day and trained side by side, hoping to master emotion.
Since Michelson wasn't famous for the right punches, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete wasn't exactly suited to a complicated golf course for Le Golf National, where a rapper usually punishes for wandering blows.
And if that's not the obstacle, at the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson will have to meet the Open Championship champion and the master of the exact match of Francesco Molinari, who won all of his matches this week in a pair with the rookie Tommy Flitwood.
If the Americans who go three points after 12 single matches start well, Michelson's match can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He fully understood his role today, clapping my back, hugging and saying that tomorrow he would be ready," said Furick.
"He has no doubt in his power.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Fame who has done so much for teams in the past and this week.
I guess I wasn't counting on him to play two games.
I was predicting more games, but it did, and so we decided to do so.
He wants to be there in the field like anyone else."
If Michelson goes out on Saturday, he's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record, which was the biggest match in the Ryder Cup tournament.
On this he might end his career at the Ryder Cup tournament, which never matched his individual achievement.
In Michelson’s 18th score of victories, 20 failures, and 7 overnight results, Furik said that his presence could play a crucial role in the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's cool to have on the team," Furick explained.
"I think the younger players had a good time finding him, and this week too, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows that the big hole is not going to solve anything.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a spectacular opening before single matches on the last day of the tournament for the Ryder Cup does not guarantee victory.
Dutchman debuted in 1997 at the Walderram Club field, where the team headed by Sev Ballesteros was ahead of the Americans by five points, but won the match with a slight score of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we've had a big match in the Walderram field; a big break in Brooklyn where we lost, and in the Walderram field, where we won violently," Bjorn said after watching the winning Class 2018 games with a result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break is 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has yet been solved.
Tomorrow you have to play with the maximum payout.
Go out into the field and do what is necessary.
The game will be completed only after the result has appeared on the board.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are well aware of who will resist us, the best players in the world."
Satisfied by the performance of his players in a complicated field, Bjorn added, "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow, things can turn out differently.
We're expected to have individual matches tomorrow, and that's different.
It's nice to play the field with your partner when everything's going well, but it's when you're standing there alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how you need to configure the players to speak tomorrow: on the edge of the possibilities.
You leave your partner unattended and now he has to show what he's capable of."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furick expects his partners to play a better game on an individual level, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Until Furik himself, fate on the last day was returned by different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we have to get started successfully, like it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative shifts to someone else’s side, players in the middle of the distance will face special pressure.
We put the players in the team accordingly, like we're going to do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to lead a counterattack in a top-mother against Rory McCillroy, and the next half of the European team has got Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter.
"Only these partners, and in that order, I chose because I want to equally distribute the effort throughout the game," that's how Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual games.
A new German warship has been rescheduled
The most recent frigate of the German Navy was to enter into force in 2014 instead of the obsolete warships of the Cold War, but according to local media, this will not happen by at least the next year because of malfunctioning systems and the steep increase in spending.
According to Die Zeit, from the spokesman for military service, the commission of the Rhineland-Pfaltz, the main vessel of the most recent frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was due to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the shipment have damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which the Navy ordered in 2007, have to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
Clearly, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies to reduce visibility, including radiological, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is the longer period of maintenance, and it is expected that new frigates will not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warn that the constant delay in over-modern military ships, which were to increase the military capacity of Germany at sea, will also make them obsolete at the time of exploitation.
The multi-stretched frigate F125 was placed in the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to bring the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm + Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first return of the ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
The reasons for the return are little known, but the German media mentioned the significant "professions of software and equipment" that made the battleship unfit for military operations.
The software weaknesses are particularly significant, since the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class consists of about 120 sailors, only half of the military who served on the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it was found that the vessel has a considerable weight surplus that makes it less operational and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It is believed that the frigate of the Rhineland-Pfaltz is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to malfunctioning, the total cost of the project was another problem, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euro has become a colossal 3.1 billion euro (US$ 3.6 billion).
Problems in obtaining new frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings of the collapse of the German Navy.
In the beginning of the year, the command of the Hans-Peter Bartels Armed Forces Bundestag reported that the Navy had "a small number of ships fit to carry out combat tasks".
The official claimed that the situation had deteriorated dramatically over time, since old ships had been decommissioned and new ones had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to replenish the Navy.
National Trust Watchs the Secret Life of Bats
A new survey carried out on land tenure in the Scottish Mountains aims to determine how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data obtained will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take steps to preserve them in the future.
In the Inveria Gardens in Wester-Russia, scientists at the Scottish National Trust will observe species such as the netopian dwarf and the bat pigmee, as well as the ear of the common and watery night.
Special registrators will be placed in strategic locations in the land area to observe bat behavior during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the Scottish National Trust will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Experimental analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and appropriateness of bat screams.
Then a detailed map of animal habitation is planned and a report is prepared to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a environmental adviser at the Scottish National Route, hopes that research will help determine which areas of living are important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of care for the environment (e.g. formation of meadows) and identify optimal conservation methods for bats and other associated species.
In the last century, bat populations have declined significantly in Scotland and in Britain.
They are threatened by active construction and occupation, which robs them of nesting sites.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, fly glued paper, chemical processing of building materials, and house cat attacks.
The sayings are not actually blind.
However, hunting at night helps your ears to catch prey more effectively than your eyes.
They use complex echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles to flight pathways.
In the Scottish National Route, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of special importance, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, bat problems are very serious.
Ten specially trained experts regularly investigate, inspect nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only Bat Reserve in Scotland, and it's located in the territory of Triv in the Damfris-and-Gallowi district, where eight out of ten species of bats live in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's office says it's the perfect place for them.
"In the territory of the town of Triv, excellent conditions for bats," he assures.
"Here are old buildings, many huge trees and other favorable living conditions.
But we still need to know a lot about bats, and based on the research that we're doing here and elsewhere, we're going to be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the area for bats before doing any technical work, since the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the young man's release can kill up to 400 females with babies, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law, and the animal is forbidden to kill, torture, or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Centre, urged the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still need a lot more information about our bats, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German edition
Kristian Ronald called the charge of rape a slander and said that people were "trying to draw attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are prepared to file a complaint against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information on suspicions.
U.S. Catherine Majorga accused the Portuguese congregator and the Juventus soccer club of rape, which took place in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid $375,000 for his silence.
A few hours after the indictments were dropped, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his fans in the Instagram video, calling the corresponding message a stick-up.
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," which is what the five-time Golden Ball Lord made on camera.
"They want to draw attention to themselves using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to take advantage of me, but these situations are part of my job.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine," added the football player smiling.
According to the Reuters news agency, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges they have published, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicion in private life."
Lawyer Christian Shertz stated that a football player would demand compensation for "moral harm in size, which corresponds to the seriousness of a violation, which is probably one of the coolest cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is said that the recorded incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at a nightclub in Ronaldo and Majorga, they returned to the player’s number where he allegedly raped her, and this testimony was handed over to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Majorga says that after the incident described, Ronald fell on his knees in front of her and said that he was a "99 percent good guy" who was "one percent."
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model, but he agreed with each other.
Majorga also states that she turned to the police and then to the hospital where she was photographed, but later she agreed to a court order because she was "fearing revenge" and warned of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous agreement because she continues to suffer because of an incident that she said had a place.
At the time of the incident, Ronalda was preparing for the transition to FK Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he became a player of the grand Italian football team, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will "sorry forever" about the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will regret it if it loses the status of a world leader in auto manufacturing after Brexit, and that's what the economy minister Greg Clark warns of.
He added that he was excited by the statement made by the representatives of Toyota UK, who informed BBC journalists that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would have to stop its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Minister Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the effects of the delay on the border in the case of Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
A factory in Bernaston, which produces Toyota models of Auris and Avensis, released about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain is to leave the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, director general of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about Britain’s exit from the EU without an agreement on international trade.
For example, BMW stated that a mini model factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of auto manufacturers are that Brexit without a deal can cause risks to supply chains.
The Toyota production line operates in the operating mode of delivery of parts and materials according to the needs – the details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for ordering cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be disruptions in the supply of details that will result in delays and shortages of material.
So, as the company says, you can put the details in Toyota's warehouse no more than one day, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clarke noted that the plan for the organisation of relations with the EU, prepared by Teresa May (Chequers Plan), "in particular, provides for a scheme for avoiding problems on the border."
"We need a deal, we need to make an optimal deal, which I think will not only allow us to succeed at the moment, but also take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during today's program on BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of the representatives of Toyota, as well as other car manufacturers, we need to preserve the well-formed high-efficiency supply chains."
Toyota was unable to report how production would be stopped for a long time, but in the long run, it is expected that an increase in spending will reduce the factory's competitiveness and, as a result, reduce jobs.
Peter Czaralis, head of the Unite trade union office in Bernaston, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned, "I can say from experience that short jobs are not being restored."
The representative of the government said, "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for shaping our future relations with the EU."
The meeting of Trump and Rosenshine may be postponed again, noted in the White House
According to representatives of the White House on Sunday, Donald Tramp's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week" while discussions are ongoing regarding the removal of Brett Kavano's candidacy as a Supreme Court judge.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in elections, the links between Tramp and Russia's assistants, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of the Deputy Attorney General being released is discussed, which will put Muller's independence at risk.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had said he was using microphones to record a conversation with Tramp and that the President's 25th amendment could be suspended.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House in the background of reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Tram, who was then at United Nations headquarters in New York City, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump stated that he would not want to release Rosenstein, but then set aside the meeting to avoid coincidence in time with the Senate Legal Committee meeting, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation by the FBI of charges against Cavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Secretary of State of Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on the Fox News Sunday television show.
And when she asked her question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not scheduled, maybe it will happen this week, and I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I keep an eye on the press for the last piece of information."
Some journalists disagreed: Saunders did not hold a briefing for the media in the White House on September 10th.
Leading Chris Wallace asked why.
Saunders said that a few briefings were not related to a "public game" by television reporters, although she said, "I won't deny that they play public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
"The president answers the questions more often than any president before him," she added, without referring to the source, "Statistics speak for themselves."
Sanders said that the briefing would still take place, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions to the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We've been trying to communicate with the press a lot, and this should be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the possibility of talking to the president of the United States is not as bad as a press conference."
The Trump regularly responds to questions from outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences involving high - ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York City this week, the president may have shown why this is so, acting in front of journalists in amazement and sometimes shocking.
The State Secretary for Health of Scotland addressed a letter to EU staff in response to concerns over Brexit
The Health Secretary of State addressed a letter to citizens of other EU countries working at the National Health Service of Scotland to express appreciation for their work and ask them to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made a commitment to cover the cost of applications for permanent resettlement for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter to Mrs Freeman, she said, "In the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of how to get out have been ongoing, and we have to wait until this autumn for solutions to be made.
But the British government is intensifying preparations for a possible solution without an agreement.
I know that this period can be very disturbing for you.
That is why I would like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Our colleagues from all over the European Union and across countries share valuable experiences and skills by strengthening and improving the health services for the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home.
Christian Ebercrombie underwent an urgent operation following a head injury
"The Tennessy State Tigers" team, Christopher Ebercrombie, carried out an urgent operation following a head injury in a Sunday match against "Vanderbilt Komodores", which his team lost with a score of 31:27.
The main coach of Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He went to the sideline where he got sick," said Reed.
By the sideline, the trainers and the medical staff had given Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it off the stretcher to conduct further testing.
The official of the Tennessee State Tigers team informed Chris Harris of the WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) channel that Ebercrombie had operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there's no evidence of the type and severity of the trauma." At Tennessee State Tigers, they're trying to figure out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a sophomore, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after he moved out of Illinois.
He took five hits of the ball on Sunday before getting out of the game, so for the season he's got 18 hits.
Foreign buyers will pay more government bribes in case they buy real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more bribes when they buy real estate in Britain. According to the new Tori plans, extra money will be spent on helping the homeless.
This arrangement neutralizes Corbin’s efforts to involve young voters
The U.S. government bribe will be drawn from those who don't pay taxes in Britain.
In the Ministry of Finance, it is expected to involve an additional £120 million a year in helping the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners who buy property in Britain will pay more duties, and additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to involve young voters with promises of more accessible housing targeted at high - paying workers.
The increase in the myth will apply to physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain, and additional funds will be directed by the government to help those who are forced to spend the night under the open sky.
An additional myth accompanying the increase of a two - year - old year - old to the second residence and the rent - giving estate may amount to three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, it is expected to involve an additional £120 million a year.
Experts estimate that 13 percent of London’s new real estate is owned by foreign citizens, making it more expensive for those who only dream of their own home.
Many rich areas of the country, particularly in the capital, are abandoned because a large number of foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new plan of action was only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state customs to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of supporting high prices for real estate by buying land without further use of it, and he called on Theresa May to abandon quotas for available real estate to correct the "disgusting situation in the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of important real estate reforms, such as rent control and inability to move out without good reason.
He also suggests extending the authority of local councils in the area of construction of a new home.
Theresa May said, "I promised last year that I would dedicate my priority to restoring the British dream -- for every new generation of life, it would be better.
This calls for changes in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair to say that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "I want to be the head coach of the Scottish Congregation."
Chief coach of the FK "Sunderland" Jack Ross says that he wants to be the head of the Scottish Assembly sometime.
A 42-year-old Scottish man was about to re-establish a club from the north-east of the country, which now holds third place in the First Football League, three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to Lake Stadium this summer, returning last season to St. Merren's in the Premier League of Scotland.
"I wanted to introduce my country as a player.
I got to Scotland's second assembly, but it was over," Ross said during the Sportsound program at the BBC Scotland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of Scottish collection at the Hempden Park Stadium, which always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to succeed in the position of the head coach of the club."
Ross' predecessors at FK "Sanderland", including Dick Lawyer, David Moes, Sam Ellardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy King, Gustavo Poet, and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach of FK "Alloa Atletik" states that he did not feel anxious about going to a big club following such authoritative names, with previous withdrawals from the FC "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"At the current stage, I'll think I've succeeded if the club returns to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and its material and technical security, this club is undoubtedly equal to the Premier League," he noted.
"This is going to be a difficult task, but the other result is unlikely to be a success."
Ross's only been building a training career for three years, and he's been a second coach at Dumbarton FK for 15 months, and he's spent 15 months at FK Garts training headquarters.
Then he helped "Alloa" to get out after the FC got to the third division, and in the next season from St. Merren came the way from the departure stage to the title of the winners of the first division.
According to Ross, he feels more comfortable now than ever during his game career at FC "Claid", "Gartlpool", "Folkerk", "St. Merren" and "Gamilton Academic."
"I'm at the crossroads," he mentions, talking about going to the FK "Alloa."
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more appropriate to me than playing.
That sounds strange, since I was successful, making good money and reaching some heights.
But it's not easy to play.
There are many challenges that we face each week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a head coach, I feel in my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt as comfortable for my adult life as I did after choosing this profession."
The full interview will be available during the sportsound transmission on Sunday, September 30, at Radio Scotland Radio from 12:00 to 1:00 in British summer time.
Study: 17:30 a.m. on Sunday – perfect time for a beer bowl
Summer heat has helped to increase the income of British pubs, which are not in the best of times, but have increased the pressure on the restaurant network.
According to sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The author of the CGA accounts, Peter Martin, who is consulting on business development, said: "With solar weather and longer weather than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, July went beyond the same scheme as last month, when pubs grew by 2.8%, and restaurants have worsened.
The red drop by 1.8% in July increased.
The pubs and bars, which are designed to serve drinks, have the best rates at the moment -- the increase in their income is equal to the loss of restaurants.
The pubs that feed food also suffered from heat but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in drinking.
In the controlled pubs and bars, drinks per month increased by 6.6%, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst for the leisure and hospitable business department in RSM, said: "We have seen similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large - scale social or sporting events remain the main factors affecting the sale of the internal market.
It's not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to lose revenue, and the annual downturn of sales by 4.8% causes particular concern about the background of the need to cut costs.
A long hot summer is not the best time for food institutions, and we'll see if the temperature we saw in August can give them such a necessary rest."
The general increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the market for new brands.
The branch indicator of sales volume of Coffer Peach Tracker in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in Britain is a representation of the collected and analysed productivity of 47 working groups, which are combined with a total sales turnover of more than £9 billion.
Every fifth child has a social networking account hidden from his parents
According to research results, 1 in 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, have social networking accounts hidden from parents and teachers.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fixed pages in Instagram
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "core account" showing their parents
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates an account on social networks that hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fixed pages in Instagram, a social network for photo exchange.
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean "core" account that shows their parents as well as one or more private.
A mother who accidentally came across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw the call to rape me there.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles on social networks. Half of these children have admitted that an additional account is secret.
The head of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, said, "We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel the desire to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will become the "athlete interest" on the Scottish Athletics radio.
Elied Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general councils of government members.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete, and the Head of the Council of Jen Beatty has described this step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead sports, to take advantage of its extensive experience gained internationally over the last decade.
"Elid enjoys great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we believe that by taking her to the council, the athletic sport in Scotland will benefit greatly," said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm going to be inspired to act as an actor for athletes, and I hope I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, a four - time Olympic champion who won the 1996 game in Atlanta, lost his ability to walk through a transit and hex attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me whether I could recover and how much.
I was able to resume my full - time ministry because of my incredible efforts, and I have learned to walk again and to exercise today!
Thank you for your support!"
Women's milk suckler advertising compared to cows – Internet users' thoughts divided
The dairy producer encountered a mixed response from Internet users to advertising where young mothers are compared to active cows.
To commemorate the release of a product called "the world's first silent milksucker", a technology company producing consumer goods Elvie released a humanist music video commercial to demonstrate the freedom afforded to mothers by a new suckler.
Four real mothers dance in a filled blue cobweb under the song, which contains the words, "Yes, I feed myself, but my tail is gone," and "How do you see it, it's not a wash, it's my breasts."
And then there's a chorus saying, "Suck it up, suck it up to feed the kids, suck it up, suck it up so the milk won't be wasted."
However, the advertising clip, published on the company’s Facebook page, caused a boisterous discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the Internet users' reaction was mixed, and many noted that advertising was undervalued by the 'trepid organization' of milk production in industry.
"Not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and give birth to milk, but their children are taken away from them in a vile way a few days after birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie's milk suckler can be easily hidden in the breastgallery for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It's clear that it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not involve them to advertise a milkman for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone else said, "This ad is very far from reality."
Other users spoke in favor of a commercial role, and one of the women's videos seemed "very fun."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would certainly have bought this if I still had breast - feeding.
By sucking milk, I really felt like a cow.
The commercial's a bit crazy, but I wasn't looking for the hidden content.
A great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "A fancy commercial that's oriented to mommies who suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertising is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, Elvie's suckler works completely silently, has no wires or tubes, and easily hides in a feeding bra, which allows women to move freely, hold children, and even go out.
Anna Ballarin, partner and executive director of the Mother advertising agency, commented on this situation: "Elvie's suckler is such a revolutionary product that he demanded a bright and provocative presentation.
Having made a parallel between women who cheat on milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breast - feeding, in an exciting and interesting way, showing an incredible sense of freedom that would bring a new suckler.
Elvie suckler doesn't get into the headlines for the first time.
Within a week of fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product while showing clothes from modeling Martha Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a sheltered town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, partly because the hard rhetoric and politics of the Trump administration have complicated the placement of children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, the caregivers have spoken out themselves to immigrants without documents, and now they are afraid to endanger their own ability to stay in the country, suggesting that they take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, the high-ranking immigration and customs officer of the Bureau, testified to Congress that the officers of the Bureau had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of minors without escorts.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the people who are caregivers or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we continue to persecute these persons," said Mr. Albens.
According to the employees of the shelter, in order to deal with children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of the children to appear before the court within a month of detention, not 60 days, as before.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing rather than come to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive asylum will be deported quickly.
According to the employees of the shelter and official information provided by responsible officials over the past months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will feel anxious or depressed, the more likely they can be to cause violence or escape.
Law enforcement officials argue that these problems are compounded in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends, we risk increasing the trauma that many of them have already suffered.
Syria ordered "occupation forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Moreover, speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualim urged Syrian refugees to return home, although there has been a war in the country for eight years.
Mualem, who also works as deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of countering terrorism, so "the attitude to them will be appropriate".
"They have to leave immediately and not set conditions," he declared at the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that the war against terrorism was actually over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people had died since 2011, and millions had left their homes.
He claimed that Damascus would continue "this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "be some illegal foreign presence".
The United States has deployed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mostly teaching and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are speaking against President Bashar Al-Assad.
More than 1,000 soldiers were sent to the war - ravaged country of France.
As for the refugees, Mualem assured them that proper conditions had been created for their return, and he also accused the Western countries of "promoting unwarranted fears" that made refugees reluctant to return.
"We called on international community and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We're watching an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The US and the European Union warn that they will not help Syria rebuild the country until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war has been concluded.
UN diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlibu, the last great dam of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on a province where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the treaty had "clear terms" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the militants associated with Al-Qaida Front Al-Nusra, who were "to be destroyed".
UN emissary Staffan de Mistura expects the earliest time to convene the first meetings of a new committee to be joined by representatives of the government and opposition to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and to create conditions for elections.
Mualem made the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to the "review of the articles of a valid constitution", and warned against interference.
Why the Trumpet Will Be Overtaken
According to this logic, Trampa can be re-elected in 2020, if many liberal viewers are expected to do so, it will not be authorized immediately after scandal and impeachment.
No doubt that would be the "dramatic conclusion of the presidency all the time"!
At the moment, the viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on the CNN channel and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, on an average 2.4 million viewers in prime time were in Fox News, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, while The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel ended up at the top of the 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news was discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Bur, the performer of the drama "Last Candidate" on the ABC channel on the Secretary of State who becomes president after a devastating attack on Capitolius.
Nell Squill, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book "Licken funny moments: and a few strict truths about getting into the club of Hollywood men" suggests another theory.
She recalled a trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said, and that's the story Mrs. Squill told me.
Chaos amuses.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, history from Washington is able to determine the future of Roy's case against Weid, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Distinction is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you watch a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward using "well-acquainted" springs for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's jacket from the ostrich skin for $15,000 (the obsessive clothing -- so wrote in The Washington Post) and the result of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy, published by Storm Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be a former one again.
"The feeling of reality-show is partly related to the fact that you have a new match every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the TV program "Stars of Lombard", about rotations in the acting warehouse, and the daily plot twists in the "Tramp" show (the NFL conflict, support by Kim Chen Inn).
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you can be hopelessly backward.
When I met Mr. Flais this week at his home on the northern coast of Cauai, the sun was warm (27 degrees Celsius), but he was at home looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
It was not when Brett Cavanaugh stood before the Senate Legal Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on his hair.
"I remember how we used to create all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flays told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External pouring of funds into Congress’s toughest midterm elections
Not surprisingly, in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, additional cash flows were directed, as two active congressmen compete for one chair by reviewing the boundaries of the constituencies.
A Democrat, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Conor Lemb, who won a victory in another district in an additional election in the past spring, has entered the fight for this suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed.
Lemb resists another active congressman, Republican Keith Rothfs, now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely similar to the new 17th.
The map was redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of January ruled that the old boundaries of the districts were targeted in favour of the republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district has sparked a fierce opposition between the financial divisions of the main parties, the US Democratic Party's Congress Election Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republic Party (NRCC).
The name Lemba became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning with the minimum advantage in the 18th district during the additional elections in Congress in March, which were used by the general public.
President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in this district.
Political experts gave little preference to Democrats.
In the United States, the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China was reconsidered.
The diplomats were reminded of the weak opposition from Washington to the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama, and before that, Trump also had a hotel in Panama, until his partners were able to retrieve the staff hired by Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department decided to call the heads of diplomatic missions of the United States from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition", said Secretary of State Gezer Nojert earlier this month.
But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in American aid in 2017, particularly in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The fines offered to reduce financial aid and the targeted visa restrictions would be painful for Central America and its high unemployment and killings.
As a result of the internal councils, officials from the North and Central American states postponed a high-level conference devoted to security and economic prosperity, a similar event took place last year, and was seen as a step forward in efforts to contain the flow of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador had ceased.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is now planning to speak at a mid-October conference to mark what the administration considers to be a very important event.
At the same time, three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, as there were no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's representative at the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions, which were reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom were diplomats, on the condition of anonymity.
The information provided was confirmed by a foreign analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
Study the History
The next problem could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, a strong confirmation of why the available public information can be found.
As part of its investigation, Muller is reportedly checking the possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our Russian voting system.
If the influence of the Congress moves into other hands, the Trumpet will have to report to the congressmen, just as it did to the voters and eventually to one party.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't mean to say that Trump's fall is imminent, just like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on either side of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will determine the length of the struggle.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if only the West began to oppose him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is defined by such critical moments, and the uncontrolled movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now waiting for a few of these critical moments.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man on whom Mr. Mueller's fate depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble while this paper came up with information that last year he suggested secretly writing down conversations with the president and sharing thoughts on the inadequacy of the Trump post.
Rosenstein called the Times inaccurate.
"How do we react if the investigation into a case against Brett Cavanaugh, which has recently begun by the FBI, is not sufficiently realistic or honest or if the Kavano can serve in the Supreme Court, despite convincing accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of the Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that used to occupy my ambassadorial house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With such an inheritance, may I not look with optimism to the future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Vienna's Rapid.
After an impressive nobody in Spain in a game with the Villarreal at the beginning of this month, winning the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with a good chance of getting out of the G Group of the League of Europe.
Because of the knee injury, half-protector Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with the Villarreal, which ended with the 2-2 bill. But he thinks that FC Rangers can use this as a tramp to achieve more.
"This was a good result for us, because Villarreal is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out with the hope of getting something and getting one point.
Maybe at the end of the match we could go forward, but generally nothing can be considered a fair result.
In the first time, the enemy was better, but after a break, we fixed the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday, there will be another important opposition in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not going to be easy, and our future rivals have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the fans, and I'm sure we can fight and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough one, starting with my injuries and ending with the changes in the club itself, but now the situation has been normalized.
We have a great warehouse, and all the boys are happy, and the training is going well.
I hope we can move on, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women lose sleep over fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they would like to organize self-care, few spoke about it with family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the study of Nationwide said that they spoke with their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked about this with their children.
"People want them to be taken care of by family members, but they don't rush to start talking about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance department.
That's where we start.
Talk to your husband or your wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care unless you give your wishes to relatives in advance.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to receive care, as this choice may be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get a financial consultant involved: He may suggest how to cover the expenses.
Sources of long-term care finance include traditional insurance policy, a hybrid policy of accumulated life insurance or self-sustainment at your own expense (provided you have money).
Prepare the legal documents carefully, which will prevent the legal pull.
Prepare confidence for your representative who will supervise your medical care and will make sure that your wishes are met if you are unable to do so personally.
We also recommend that we develop trust in the provision of money.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay your bills if you fail.
Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs immediate medical attention, so they take him to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer your questions about medicine and allergies?
Write down such information to be ready.

which medicines can be taken and
Who'll look after the dog.

In Ilfrakum, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle.
The man fired a rifle several times when he returned home from the party.
A 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfacuma, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 02:30 a.m. in British summer time as "accidentality."
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His wounds are not life - threatening, but the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a major earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, reports government officials, but the number of victims may increase.
Because of the way out of the communication system, officials dealing with humanitarian aid issues cannot get any information from Donggal's regent, the area north of Palu, which is closer to the 7.5 points of magnesium earthquake epicenter.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Consider a few basic facts about the town of Palu and Dongala’s regent on the island of Sulavez.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavez, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800, according to 2017.
When the tsunami struck an earthquake, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regent that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in northwestern Sulavez Island.
According to a 2017 report, about 299,200 people live in the administrative region located in the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic sectors of Central Sulavesi Province, especially the dongal coastal region.
The production of nickel is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian agency, the effects of natural disasters have been mitigated several times over the past 100 years by Palu and Dongal.
In 1938, more than 200 people died as a result of the tsunami in Dongala and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996 the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismic, active Pacific Fire ring and suffers from earthquakes on a regular basis.
Below are some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: December 26, the heavy earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acheg, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, most of whom were in the Acheg province.
2005: At the end of March, at the beginning of April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the Sumatra coast.
2006: Magnitude earthquake 6.8 points skyrocketed south of Java, Indonesia’s densest island, and caused the tsunami that hit the south coast, resulting in the death of some 700 people.
2009: In the vicinity of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, there was an earthquake of 7.6 points.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5 - bal earthquake brought down one of the islands of Mentaway, located near Sumatra, and caused tsunamis to rise to 10 meters, killing tens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: a slight earthquake hit Subjay's Regent in Acheg province, causing destruction and panic related to the failure of humans to forget the devastating earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed under debris.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Lomboc tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless homes, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island immediately.
Sarah Paylin’s eldest son was arrested for being charged with domestic violence
Treka Paylin, the eldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and a candidate for Vice President Sarah Paylin, were arrested for the charge of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police of 29-year-old Paylin of Vasili, Alaska, arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and accused him of obstructing the report of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took the phone away from her.
According to KTUU, Peylin is in custody in the Matanuska-Susistna insulator with the right to deposit a mortgage of $500.
He stood trial on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when he was asked whether he confessed his guilt, reported online.
Pailin is accused of three sins in class A, which involves a one - year term and a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with class B misconduct, which is punishable by a $2,000 prison day and a $2,000 fine.
For the first time, criminal charges against Paylin have been brought.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, and he was prevented from reporting domestic violence and carrying a weapon of alcohol abuse when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her on the face.
In 2016, Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups for justifying her son’s violent post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused tsunami: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawese on Friday.
The 7.5 - bal earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The networks of communication and power supply have come out of the line, and the number of victims may increase in the days to come.
The quake took place near the center of the island of Sulavez, located northeastern of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The social network video shows the moment the storm hit.
Hundreds gathered at a festival on the beach of Palu, when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal accusers demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
In New York City, federal accusers demand the death penalty of Syphollo Saipov, suspected of being in a New York terrorist attack, resulting in eight deaths -- a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
According to reports, in October of the 30-year-old Saipip, behind the home Depot pickup, he drove off on a bicycle track along the West Side road, lower Manhattan, and began to knock down cyclists and pedestrians on his way.
In line with the report of intent to achieve the execution of the death penalty filed in the New York State District in order to justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight persons and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm.
According to the judicial records, each of these charges provides for the possibility of capital punishment.
A few weeks after the Federal Court of Jurists attacked, Saipo was charged with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion, which are usually made by federal defendants in matters related to organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to the accusers who described the crime committed by Saipov as "fearful, cruel and malicious", this attack is the result of "serious planning and preconceived craftsmanship."
By the victims that Saiful Habibullaevich Saipov had suffered, injured or killed, Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko became victims, as described in the plan report.
Five dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since New York City's South District last broke a crime case that is punishable by death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, and finally sentenced to permanent imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the federal death penalty was executed in New York in 1953, and married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were electrocuted on June 19, 1953.
According to the judicial records of Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show a guilty conscience the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he was not sorry for what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov informed the authorities that he had been inspired by the video IDIL that he was viewing on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the flag of IDIL in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipo, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting the admission of guilt and sentencing of life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only reinforce the psychological trauma caused by these events to all the victims," said Patton.
A party to Saipov’s protection had also asked the accused not to seek the death penalty.
Parliamentary member of the Conservative Party believes that NAIJAL FRARAJA should be given responsibility for the talks on Brexit
Today, during the protest at the Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the People's Army."
Former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that politicians should "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics, since one of Parliamentary deputies Teresa May offered his candidacy to hold negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Boone, claimed on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "be done" had Mr. Faraj been Secretary of Brexit.
Attention to the problems May faced in trying to reconcile her deeply broken ranks has further attracted the fact that members of the Conservative Party who oppose the exit joined in a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to put into practice the compromise plan Chequers, despite the attacks by the Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will not give up trying to make a deal with Brucessel despite the negative reaction, and that she will force the Eurosceptics and the Labourers to choose between what she offers and the chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihalla, Mr. Boone said he wanted to say "renouncing Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraj to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were to answer for it, we'd be out," he said.
Parliamentary MP Wellingboro added, "I'll support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We fought in world wars not to be subordinated.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British changed their minds and didn't want to go out is completely untrue."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporters of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not supported by our party and our activists, who actually walk the streets and fight for the vote.
Please reject Chequers and start listening."
In a letter to Teresa May, she added, "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraj stated that politicians should "feel pressure" if they are going to give up the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a question of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say that they won't get away with it."
In a report to the enthusiastic crowd he added, "I want our political elite, who are planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel pressured.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country that will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never calm us down until we become independent, self-serving, proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the opponents of the exit went through Birmingham and then held a two - hour rally at the center of the city.
Several activists waved "Conservatives against Brexit" banners after starting the group this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis scoffed at the conservatives because security problems arose after the opening of the conference because of their party program.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a full farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "think seriously" about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would “think seriously about running for the presidency”.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts told about her future during the general meetings in West Massachusetts.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, is running in November for a second term against a member of Jeff Dil's Republican party, co-chaired by the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is seen as the main candidate that will be able to fight Tram in 2020.
Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in general meeting format since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she intended to participate in the presidential election.
Warren said, "it's time for women to go to Washington and get the government working, and there's a woman on his forehead."
The suspect was arrested in a firearm murder by a basketball player named LSU Tigers Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday, reported that on Friday, a suspect was arrested in a firearm murder by a basketball player named LSJ Tigers, Wade Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in Eastern Time.
On Friday, they released a video shooting request to help identify the person on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot at a campus at Southern University on Friday morning.
" Wade Sims got a gunshot wound to his head and died," journalist 247 sports chief Murphy J. Paul declared on Saturday.
Wade joined his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found at the scene, carrying weapons, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Button County Police Department.
Sims, who was 6 feet tall and 6 inches tall and who performed in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge, and he played 32 games with 10 stars in the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes in the field, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Gran Pry Russia: Lewis Hamilton cut back on the world championship after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the time that Waltter Bottas left behind Lewis Gemilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’s command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Buttas was a good starter from the fields and almost bypassed Gemilton, who tried to hold his position on the first two turns and gave Fattel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the pit stop first and left Hemilton on the track in the tail of the race, which was supposed to solve everything.
The pilot of the Mercedes team passed another circle and walked behind the Fettel, but Gemilton broke into the leaders after a certain wheel-to-wheel maneuver, leaving the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the inner space because of the risk that it would tighten after a double maneuver managed to move forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from behind the grid and stayed in seventh place until the end of the first round.
He led most of the race because he didn't change the tires to come to the finish and put Kimi Rikkonen in fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at the pit stop on the 44th wheel, but couldn't increase the pace at the last eight, so Rykkonen took the fourth place.
"It's a tough day, because Waltery was on full tour on all weekends, and he showed me the nobility when he gave me the opportunity to go.
The team did an exceptional job to take first and second place," said Hamilton.
The Body’s Language Was Not Impressed
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feynstein for her firm stand in that she did not publicize the contents of Christine Blaze Ford's letter, who accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh of sexual violence.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address directly the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, but instead expressed his view of what happened in the Senate, which, he said, demonstrated the human "absoluteness, disgustingness and lying".
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful thing that's been happening in the Senate for the last few days, is anger, you see the evil people who demonstrate vileness, abominations and lies," he said.
"You look at publications and published information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feynstein, did you share information?
Think back to her answer... did you publish the contents of the documents? – "What?
Oh, no.
I didn't advertise."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't advertise," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Feynstein received a letter with a detailed statement of charges against Ford v. Cavanaugh, and at the beginning of September his contents were made public, but Feynstein objected that the leak of the information had taken place in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't disclose information from her," said Feynstein to the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her objection seems to have displeased the president who commented during the Saturday rally, "I'll tell you, her body language was not impressive at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone do worse."
Continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual violence by three women, the president assumed that democracy was being used for its own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power in any way necessary.
You see the vileness, the disgustingness, to them all the same who are offended, through whom you must transgress to gain power and control," Mediaite quotes the president's words.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" – "Belphast Giants", 5:3
"Jiants" player Patrick Duier dropped two pucks in a match against "Dandi"
"Dandy Stars" was re-emerged for Friday's defeat in the elite league from Belfast Giants, winning Saturday's 5/3 matchback.
The Giants got an early advantage in two pucks thanks to Patrick Duyer's and Francis Bouville's throws.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney leveled the score at the home game, and then Dwyer re-entered the Giants.
The Dandy Player François Bushard evened the score, and the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen ensured their victory.
This is the third in the season of the elite league defeat of the team of Adam Cephas, who won the willful victory over the Dandie with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season.
When Kendall McFoll was handed over to the first Shibu Duier, he left the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFoll, and after four minutes, Bovillee, who received a puck from David Rutherford, doubled the bill.
After the tense first period of fourteen minutes (13:10) Sullivan returned the owners of the field to the game, and in the sixteenth minute (15:16), Coney, after receiving the checkup from Matt Markwardt, leveled the score.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Jayants before the first break, leaving his second shift at the end of the first period.
The owners of the fields were regrouped, and Bushar, for twenty - eight minutes (27:37), again leveled the account, leaving the Shibu when his team prevailed.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he brought the Dandi forward for the first time and secured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the "Jiants" team, which has already lost four of the last five matches, is going to play the MILTON KINES Touring match.
Air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape an earthquake.
The pilot in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped fly a plane with hundreds of people at the price of his life.
Over 800 people were killed and many were missing after a severe tsunami on the island of Sulavez on Friday.
Strong underground impulses continue to shake the area, and many have fallen under the floods in the city of Palu.
However, unlike their colleagues who had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a high - pitched station at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained there to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, who was on the runway at the time, rose safely into the air.
Then he jumped out of the switchboard tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
Later, he died in the hospital.
A representative of an Indonesian air navigation service company, Johannes Sirajt, claimed that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balkipapan to Calimantan, which is supposed to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're very sorry to hear about this," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands because the agency's mitigation of the consequences of the country's natural disasters claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims may increase because many bodies are still under debris and many of them cannot be reached," Sutopo Purvo Nugrocho said.
The six - foot - high waves devastated the city of Palu, where mass funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes provide assistance and food.
Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances bring bodies.
There's not enough clean water.
Mini-marts are all over the place."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN, "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's a tragedy, but things can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joco Ododo, came to Palu on Sunday and asked the country's military officers, "I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on Lombark Island, killing over 550 people.
Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after a plane crash in the lagoon, one man disappeared.
The airline, who was on a plane in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one person disappeared, even though it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
At Air Niugini, it was stated that one passenger could not be found at the time of Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives try to find a husband and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
In the airline and U.S. Navy, the plane landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low above ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told us that he and others were able to make it to the emergency exits on a thin plane as a belt in the water.
He told us that the stewardess panicked and shouted, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the dock upgrade also helped in a rescue operation, delivering people to shore by means of an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 feet (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, in the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in plane accidents involving registered PNG aircraft, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
The analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against the man who was accused of burning the Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Ministry analyst Paul Roulett witnessed as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to replicate the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and Jessica Chambers' 19-year-old victim on the night of the murder.
Roulette, according to The Clarion Ledger, told him that he had been given location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night she died, that it contradicted his previous statement.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the accusers asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's pickup that night, Sanford said he was "stupid, because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was Tellis’s claim that he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette explained that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, he had released text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers’ phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Gail declared.
The defense must make its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the jury to pass the trial on to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: what is a conscious hip hop?
Trio hip-hop performers want to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol says hip-hop has changed its nature -- gone political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the drains and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed the revival of this trend in the United Kingdom through groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark one?!
In New York, a nanny filed a parole lawsuit, receiving a racist message.
In New York, a nanny filed a lawsuit for a couple for a discriminatory release after she received the wrong message from her mother complaining that she was "another dark one."
Marriage denies being racist by comparing the lawsuit with the "necessary."
Lynci Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who arrived on her first day of work in 2016, was dark.
"No, one dark hair," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Fluxman to her husband in a report.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she twice sent it to Miss Morris.
As New York Post reports, after realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired Miss Morris, she said that their previous nanny, who was African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines instead.
Miss Morris paid for one day's work and then went home to Uber.
Morris is now serving a couple in court, hoping to get compensation for her payback, which she would have received in six months of working with a couple who first hired her, although without a contract, to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do that," she said, "and she said, "Friday, I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusations that they were racist, the couple stated that the release of Morris was a wise decision because they feared that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said her husband Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with a man whom you treated rudely, even if it were not deliberately?
Your baby?
That's right.
Comparing the lawsuit with the demand, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and "had not yet recovered."
"Would you avenge anyone after that?
It's a bad thing," added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticizing their conduct and logic.
According to a new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking.
Bonda Karen Yankel's daughter, who was born almost immediately after they agreed to print the book, said of the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the first person who reads the book before it was published.
Now that's funny, because we know about the huge success that Padington's story has achieved."
Speaking of her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, optimistically reacted to his refusal, she divided herself into the 60th anniversary of the book's release at the same time feeling "joy and sorrow" because his father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud of the book being so popular.
"He was quite a humble man and did not like to brag," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child!
I think that's how he looked at Padington's success.
Even though Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the 2nd hospital of Louis Pasteur in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"Over called regularly, said that it was really bad that she should not have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperus.
"And then over called me and said she would die in the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medications that the doctors gave her to continue to fight, gradually stopped and left the body.
She died a while before everything was shut down.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperus, who was grieving over her daughter's loss, boarded a plane with other passengers, disregarding the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I lowered my head and could not hold back my tears.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deeply for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Gambres leave a postcard with phone numbers on the Valley Bridge that people can use for support, as well as messages that they can be inspired by.
Miss Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Leida, said that her son was a prospective chef with a handsome smile.
"Everybody knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made every room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, 11 at the time, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll have consequences."
Miss Davis created the postcards so that people would know that there are those to whom they can turn and talk, even if it's just a friend.
Don't lock yourself in, you have to talk."
Miss Humphreys, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed that he was depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he was totally depressed, and when the kids opened up their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death had become a huge injury to them, but they had to survive it, and it was devastating.
We need to stay with the family.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future hangs on his hair: FBI launches investigation
"I thought that if we could get what we asked for -- limited in time and the nature of the investigation -- we might have reached a certain agreement," Mr. Flake stated on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "broken" in the background of an unprecedented loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is linked to time.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will make it difficult for them to try to get their own man to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush telephoned Senator Cavanaugh, who was working in the White House under Mr. Bush’s rule, and who enabled him to meet his wife, Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice President Mike Penz to resolve the problem with the same number of votes and approve him as the Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Koreans has been "trembling"
After Kim Chen Ying came to power seven years ago, the number of North Koreans to South Korea was reduced, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Pion Seugg, referring to data from the South Korea United Republic of Korea, stated that last year the number of interceptors was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers carrying illegals are now demanding more money.
In Phinehas they refrained from making public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans claimed to have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMM) between two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcefully repeats them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issues of denuclearization, which were deadlocked.
This happened after the June historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Yin in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yeon-Ho accused the United States of not making any progress since the sanctions were accepted.
"With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no such thing as unilateral disarmament," said Ri Yeon-Ho in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Bretta Cavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The Head of Minority in Nancy Pelosy's House named the candidate for the Supreme Court of the Court of Brett Cavano as "hysterical" and stated that he was not eligible for the Supreme Court's post at the time.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts on an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I kept thinking that if a woman had ever done that, she would have been called hysterical," Pelosi commented on her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Cavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he almost screamed and coughed, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "absorbed and coordinated destruction of reputation" by organized liberals, who were upset that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelos believed that Cavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudiced view of the Democrats.
"I think that these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will himself take his candidacy," she said.
Pelosy was furious when she was asked if she would try to declare Kavano an impeachment if his guilt confirmed, and if he would receive democracy, most of the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only for the Supreme Court to work, it's for the court where he works now," Pelosi said.
Now Cavanaugh is serving as judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Cavanaugh against the Law on Access to Medical Services or the Row v. Veyd case, because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of approval at Cavanaugh’s post, he asked whether he would cancel some Supreme Court rulings.
"It's not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, prejudiced person and we'll tell you how wonderful it is," Pelosi said.
Women should possess this weapon.
These are just words that contained months and years of rage, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "One woman who worked somewhere as an executive director, and helped me a lot, said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had her own method, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the householder, "You can think that I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
I am evil."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered acceptable to anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my most clear memories of my first job at the office, where men usually worked, was that I once cried out of unspeakable anger, and the older woman, an unfriendly manager, who I always feared a little, grabbed me by a collar and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder, a then Democrat congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on an extra-marriage boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Ms. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said, laughing to me 30 years later.
"There have already been seven other candidates in the race, and one more candidate is the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "The White Lady and the Seven Dwarves."
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was late in the congregation, so she made a promise that she would not participate in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret the support of the men of $1,000, only gave her $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave the talk and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was emotionally grateful to the people who supported her, to the disappointment of the system, which made it very difficult for her to raise money and to make the vote the wrong way for the members of the Chamber of Deputies and the anger for sexism, and she was willing to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Miss Schroeder to the press.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone?
“She cried?”
How the U.S. - China trade war can bring benefits to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and, although far from the end, in the long run, divisions between countries can benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
This week’s biggest increase was due to new tariffs on goods totalling 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), which actually tax half of all goods coming from China in the United States.
Beijing paid back every time with the same coin, recently imposing a myth of between five and ten percent on American goods of $60 billion.
China has committed itself to using similar US measures, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to miss the opportunity to keep that promise soon.
To force Washington to retreat means to accept the demands, but for Chinese President Si Jingpin, the public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing correctly uses the situation, the pressure in the U.S. trade war can bring China a long-term advantage by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a severe economic downturn in any country, and this is actually a greater threat than the observers had previously recognized," said analyst Ebigile Grace, who is dealing with Asia-related issues at the Center for New American Security Analysis Centre.
Foreign Minister says Syria's ready to return refugees
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and to seek help in rebuilding a country devastated by war that lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualham stated that the conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the real situation has become more stable and secure through the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to reinvigorate terror - torn areas so that people can return to normal life.
The conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and restricted their livelihoods, have now been created.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem claimed that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept assistance in restoring the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the upheaval.
Europe fortifies victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 when it won the U.S. team with a sum of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburb of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has already been defeated six times in Europe and has failed to win the 1993 Raider Cup.
Europe regained its crown when the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn recruited 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Michelson, who worked hard most of the tournament, beat his first long shot on the 16th moon of steam-3 into the water and gave way to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever taken the 5-0-0 since the beginning of a modern-day tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit was defeated with a score of 5:4 from the lowest rating player in the European Turbier Oleseen team in Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who is taking the first step in the world rating, gave in to a score of 2:1 on John Paulter from England, who may have been in the Ryder Cup tournament for the last time.
Spanish Serchio Garcia, a Raider's Cup veteran, who has already been in the tournament eight times, became the European who won the most in tournaments all the time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"I don't normally cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to return the cup.
It's the team's credit, and I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, without holding back her emotions after winning Europe.
He's handing over his fellow countryman John Ram, who won the American legend of Tiger Woods golf on Sunday in a single game with a score of 2-1.
"I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, I've grown up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods has lost all four matches and now has a career record for the Rider Cup 13-21-3 tournament.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, giving only to Jack Niklaus.
During all weekends, the U.S. congregation tried to reach the fairway zone, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finnau, who showed high - class golf throughout the tour.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said of his team after a disappointing speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a short period of domination over Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Golf Players of the United States and the Committee of the Ryder Cup tournament, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
They cannot be commended.
We lost."
Current information on red tides: decrease in concentration in Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in red - color microorganism bloom in some parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission on Fish and Wildlife, the flowering conditions reported in certain areas of the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier indicate a decrease in concentration.
The blooming of red microorganisms stretches about 130 miles [130 km] of coastline from the north of Pinellas to the southern districts of Lee.
Beaches can be found about 10 miles from the Gilsboro district, but less than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there was an average concentration in the Pinella district and its coastal zone, a concentration from low to high in the Gilsboro coastal zone, a high concentration in Manat County, a high concentration in the Sarasota district and its coastal zone, a high concentration in the Charlotte district, a high concentration in the Lee district and its coastal zone, and a low concentration in the Collier district.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier continue to report respiratory irritation.
Such reports were not registered in northwest Florida last week.
