Members of the Welsh Assembly fear that they will ‘look like Mupetti’
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are converged on the proposal that their title should be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Velš Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could make a mockery.
One member for the Labour Party stated that his group feared that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
For Plaid, a member said that the group as a whole “is not happy” and proposed alternatives.
The Grand Conservative stated that his group was approaching a change in the name “with an open mind”, but noted that the MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter ‘w’ is spoken in a similar way to the letter ‘u’ in Yorkshir English.
The Commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce a change in the name, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be on the members themselves."
The Law of the Welsh Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals where broad support was given the option of calling the Assembly the Velš Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the assembly, the committee preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP version received the greatest support in the public debate.
Members of the Assembly are clearly proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus may bring to the attention of President Elin Jones, who is to submit a proposal for legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members and the proposal of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title in the context of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians will go to the vote about changing the country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia".
All voting should resolve decades of ongoing conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of the northern neighbour is a right in the Greek territory and repeatedly protest against the application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite to change the name, said he would not follow the vote.
The proponents of the referendum, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zaeva, argue, however, that changing the name is simply the price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be dead because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival.
"The older people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today there's no one."
The disappearance of bars is understandable to him.
"People are meeting in a different way today," he says.
"Bars are no longer living quarters where people regularly go."
As far as churches are concerned, money from the sale of property will not be sufficient for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they began.”
As it adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such kind of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and that is why the day will soon come when these churches will be closed completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into their homes would become church members."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original Belarusian Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was occupied by the Black Congregation, whose religious practices took place not far from here.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert, who played the bell in July, called it "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first soundtrack in the world to be played by Black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a bigger bell at a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
Over the past few months, St. Martin has had a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom have called out lay church leaders and other episcopal dioceses.
The Council of Elders, the head of the parish, composed of lay representatives, sent a letter in July diocese expressing concern that the diocese “will try to make money” on the council of elders, although it did not participate in any hiring of architects and builders that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of diocese.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy in California who dived for lobsters
According to an official report, the shark attacked and injured a 13 - year - old boy who was diving for lobsters on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been scuba diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy call for help, and then he ran to him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel stated that he first considered the call to be a joy of catching a lobster, but then “you realized that he was shouting, ‘ Kissing me!
He bit me!'"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that “he had the whole area torn apart as a key bone. ”
“I shouted to all of you to go out of the water, ‘In the water there is a shark!’” Hammel adds.
The boy was in critical condition by a helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
The swimmer Captain Larry Giles at the press conference stated that the shark was seen in this area several weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach at Ponto Beach in Casablad after Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security and investigation.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the cosmetics market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's wants to stand up to the Boots, Supercool and Debenhams chains with cosmetic streets in the style of a business house where specialized salesmen will be available.
As part of a strong market for cosmetics in the UK, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and domestic needs are declining, streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country.
The investment in cosmetics is connected with the effort of supermarkets to find use for regals previously used for television, microwaves and domestic needs.
Sainsbury's states that it doubles the range of cosmetic products to up to 3,000 products and for the first time mentions brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweizerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space also gets the existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees thanks to branded places like those in shops such as Boots.
Supermarket also reinstates its range make-up Boutique, so most products will be vegan, which young customers increasingly require.
In addition, in two shops Saintsbury’s will test the concessions of retail salesman Fragrance Shop perfume. Last week, the first such trade was opened in Croydon in south London and the next year will be in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping on the Internet and moving towards daily shopping for small quantities of food in local stores means that supermarkets have to try harder to attract people.
Director-General Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that the stores will look more and more like business houses because the supermarket chain is trying to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount sellers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of Argos branch stores and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are the chains that he bought two years ago. This increased food sales and acquisitions are even more profitable.
The previous attempt on the supermarket to remodel the department with cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended in disdain.
At the beginning of the millennium of Sainsbury’s tested the joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after an argument about the distribution of revenues from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sale of 281 pharmacies for 125 million pounds to Celesio, which owns the chain of Lloyds pharmacies.
Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding to four stores an extended range of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sales Director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the appearance and style of the streets with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our brand range should satisfy all needs and an attractive environment and an advantageous location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is "enraged" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract for £11 million.
The star of the show Dragons Den Peter Jones is "surrendering" after TV moderator Holly Willoughby stepped down with a $11 million contract with his life stamp so she can focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homemade clothes and Truly accessories.
The business of this couple has been compared to the Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The seven-year-old moderator announced that she had left for Instagram.
Holly Willoughby enraged the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources reported by Jones, when a television star at a tight Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to new contracts — up to £1.5 million — it would no longer be able to devote enough time to their sign of domestic clothing and accessories, Truly.
The company was compared to Goop's actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and could double the moderator's wealth at an estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When 17-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that Truly was leaving, Jones went from Britain to one of his summer seats.
The unnamed source states: “The line of Truly was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would provide her for decades in advance.
Her decision to leave all the participants was absolutely shocking.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready for sale at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator of the show This Morning, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could become millions due to a massive investment in the products from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing and possible further delay of the mark.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and two-year-old Jones joined in March as chairman of the board.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is supposed to become M&S's ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin as he directs the I'm A Celebrity show on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Difficult "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism that he received from journalists as a remark that some consider to be "an unfortunate president", and how positively he spoke of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump answered with his mocking “voteer’s ” voice.
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore Trump was regarded as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the negotiations on the destruction of nuclear weapons are stuck at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a prominent North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “responsible response” to its first steps of disarmament.
Instead, the US continues in sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"North Korea is doing great," he said.
"We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, according to him, brought positive results – ending rocket tests, helping to free the hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual access to information about relationships with Kim.
"It is so easy to act as president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we should have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said and pointed out to the crowd in front of us.
Tsunami waves and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the post-Lombok earthquake situation, for example, foreign NGOs have learned that there is no need.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomboku was expelled from their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that they did not require international assistance, so it is a little difficult," Mrs Sumbung said.
The Save the Children organization has been putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not clear yet whether foreign staff can work here.
Speaking agency for national disasters, Mr Sutupo said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Paul to see if international organisations will be able to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the land of wrath of Mother Nature is still sadly unprepared.
Although shelters against the tsunami were built in Aceh, it is not common at all on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of siren warning in Paul against the tsunami is likely contributing to the loss of human lives.
Even at the best of times, travelling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which docked in Lombo and assisted the victims of the earthquake, is now moving to Paula, but it will take at least three days to get to the place of the new calamite.
Improving the poor infrastructure of Indonesia was President Joko Widodoa's main point of election campaign and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year, he will seek his election again, but his government is plagued by financial outbursts.
President Joko also faces pressure from the ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority adopt a more conservative form of faith.
Street fights between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and tens of thousands of people have fled their homes.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a match against Chelsea.

He flipped the ball to his left and fired at the remote bar.
The shot flew high and headed towards the right upper corner of the gate.
The ball finally jumped off the jumping Kepu Arrizabalag and ended up in a net.
"I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible." said Sturridge server LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming to me, so I didn't think much about it, and I shot at one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 in half time to the goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
Attacker Blues sent his passport back to Mate Kovacic, then he turned around in the middle of the playground and sprinted half of Liverpool.
Kovac lost the ball quickly.
Then he sent the ball down a beautiful alley to Hazard in calcium.
He ran off defense and left to finish off the remote pole next to Alison Becker of Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 15 o'clock, Liverpool will meet with a local team in the League of Champions at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Thursday at 15 o'clock in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of victims of the tsunami wave in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian Disaster Authority stated on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami wave rose to 832.
The 7.5-degree earthquake hit Friday, sparked waves of up to 6 metres and trapped many people in the wreckage of buildings, said at a press conference the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The city of Paula, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 23-year-old man who was a woman stabbing suspect.

Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says to this: “The investigation is only at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who have moved near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, whose onboard cameras may have noticed something to contact us because they can have important information for our investigation,"
A police speaker confirmed that a dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who think they know a woman to ask where she was found this morning.
Police have reported that investigations are under way and are now reporting related victims.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could go into or out of the building.

The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has recently become a hit over an argument about the "translation of history"
His expulsion would be a worthy punishment for the destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatic Puritan followers in the style of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolishness" and "try to rewrite history."
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, says: “In the existing debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character would become one of the goals before the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not direct or implement the iconoclammation in English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent creation of Cromwell, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the 19th century's view and part of the history of the figure that many think still deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today somewhat less than at the end of the 19th century, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unscrupulous historical debates.
Of course, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure that represents one side of this division.
His success as Lord of the Protector is also worth celebrating and a reminder."
A killer pig tore up a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, the market in Southeast China was attacked and killed by a pig farmer.
As the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, a man with only the surname “Yuan” was found dead with a broken artery in a pool of blood not far from the market in Liou-pchan-shui in Kuej-chou province.
The pig farmer is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs in September 30 May 2005 in the city of Si-ning in the Chinese province of Ching-chai.
Apparently, on Wednesday he and his cousin came from the province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out the door to the next bench was open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the shed with blood on it.
According to the information, the forensic examination confirmed that the farmer’s 250 kilograms [250 kg] pig had been torn apart.
“Bratranec had his legs all bloody and torn,” quoted the daily Guyyang Evening News as a cousin named ‘Wu’.
The security footage shows Yuan coming to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was closed so no one else would think of it when the police at the crime scene gathered evidence.
Market officials allegedly treat Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Attacks of pigs on people are rare, but they've already occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts and a man critically wounded.
Ten years earlier, a 300kg pig pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor and drove him away to the farmer’s wife.
After a farmer ate his pigs in 2012 from Oregon, a farmer from Manitoby told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "starter".
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwest US
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken and move over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, it will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
At 5 o'clock in the morning of the east, Rosa reached the wind speed of 137 km/h, representing a hurricane of category 1, and was located 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It's expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure bubble forms and moves eastward to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will be like a tropical storm and starts pushing tropical humidity north into the southwest of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm precipitation on Monday.
The tropical humidity then with the approaching low pressure gap in the coming days will cause heavy rain in the southwest of the United States.
Precipitation 25 to 100 mm locally causes dangerous floods, dry currents and possible landslides in the desert.
A strong tropical humidity causes the precipitation to be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the USA, especially over most Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In the case of rapidly worsening conditions, floods may occur due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Given the dangers of tropical precipitation, it would be very unwise to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to become a raging river, and storms bring local shock winds and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure gap will bring severe local precipitation on some parts of the coast of southern California.
There may be a total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which could result in smaller currents of the sinuses and slippery trolleys.
It will be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
On Sunday night and Monday morning, the only tropical excesses will begin approaching Arizona, and on Monday evening, the rain will spread on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the heavy rain will spread to the four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense changes in temperature across the U.S. because the Arctic is starting to cool down, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to extreme temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is in the US on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahou in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa there is a difference of nearly 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will try to re-energize the rising summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and east of the United States, a warm start is expected with temperatures of around 27 °C from southern plans to parts of the north-east of the USA.
New York City could be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows in the first half of October the high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States.
Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation followed over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people have watched six television channels in a quarter-year-old incommunicado statement by the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued and voters interrupted regular programmes with reports of a sudden Friday return: an agreement facilitated by Senator for Arizona Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week indictment investigation.
Christine Ford told the Senate board that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was holding her at a high school party drunk and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people are being watched by Nielsen.
The company calculated average readings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
Numbers for other stations that broadcast statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at offices.
To compare, it's a similar number of spectators watching football games in playoffs or sharing Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest stake of all stations when, according to Nielsen, an average of 5.69 million viewers watched him throughout the entire day's hearing.
The second was ABC station with 3,26 million viewers.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest persisted even after the meeting.
Senator Flake was the main figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of this temperate Republican announced that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as protestors shouted at him when he was going to take the elevator to the trial committee.
CNN carried lively how he stood with his eyes folded for a few minutes and had him snooping.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you."
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
He also said: “You have power, while many women are powerless. ”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and even before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast lively when the Judicial Commission was to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh to vote in the entire Chamber.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flakea has partly persuaded talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without investigation the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused the critics of "politicists" regarding Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused the critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "policies" about Britain's future and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the Birmingham Conservative Conference on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the prime minister on the front page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose their duties was "absolutely senseless".
Shooting at Waydea Sims: Police have arrested Dyneon Simpson, who is a suspect from the death of an LSU player
Police have arrested suspect in the case of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge police department said that Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second degree murder.
The authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson and, according to the Sims police, lost his glasses in a match.
According to the WABF channel under the CBS, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, Simpson admitted after the interrogation that he shot Wade.
According to the defence, bail was set at USD 350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department thanks the police unit for the Louisiana State Refugees, the state police crime labs, the Southern University police and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for “singing and striving for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-meter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU,
Last season he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points for the match.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wade's death was "shrunken" and "shocked" him.
"This is what you are still afraid of," Wade said.
Soppa's got ashes on Mexico City.
The ash that flows from the Popacatépetl volcano hit the southern district of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano, after the volcanic activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center has been watching a series of riots and shocks.
On social networks, photos of front windows of cars covered with thin ash in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochilico, appeared.
Geophysicists recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometres (45 miles) south-east of the capital city. The last earthquake shook Central Mexico in September 2017 and had a 7.1-degree force.
The volcano known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the vote on independence, the police clashed with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protestors of independence clashed with the police and thousands of people engaged in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence that divided Catalonia.
The orderly police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powdered paint at them. The streets, which are usually flooded by tourists, created dark clouds of dust.
Later, there were also clashes that the police had to use the shoes to calm down.
In a few hours, the independent groups sang “Let’s not forget, forgive” face protestors of the Union who called for “Living Spain”.
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured in protests.
The year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid considers to be illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, remains the tension in the region seeking independence.
The voters spoke out of the majority for independence, but participation in the elections was low because the opponents of the separation boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes throughout the region attempted to end voting in the polls.
Supporting independence groups stayed out on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Although the demonstration had taken place, she had to choose a different route.
The 18 - year - old electrician Narcis Termes, who joined the woman in a separatist protest, said he no longer hopes for independence for Catalonia.
"Last year we lived through some of the best moments.
My parents cried out with joy that they could vote, but now we're in a dead end," he said.
Despite the important, even though the close victory in the regional elections last December of the Catalan side, the supporters of independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their best-known leaders either went to exile themselves, or are waiting in custody for their share of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The two-year-old montaire Joan Puig recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and said that the conflict fanned politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tighter," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will be running for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after crashing the car into the house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were imprisoned after repeatedly bumping into a house in Londonderra.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crecent on Thursday at around 7:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, someone may have also shot the car out of the bush.
Mengo's shot secured Livingston's 1-0 victory over Rangers.
Dolly Mengy's first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston, who stepped from a lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only a second defeat of 18 matches as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Trefa Dolly Mengy turned out to be decisive when Gary Holt's team reached the Hibernian second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't won this season yet in the Premiership League on the guest field, and next Sunday he'll be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
The Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Livingston has expanded a number of games without defeating the division to six games, so the main coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, hasn't tasted the defeat yet.
Livingston didn't take the chance against unexplained guests.
Holt's team was supposed to run long before the goal, because his directness caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he failed before the gate, then Alan Lithgo's slide just missed Craig Halketta's head in front of the gate.
Home people were just watching Rangers play before them because they knew that guests could suffer from standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers was ordered free kick and Livingston created a sculina, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent Mengu, who ran and scored the ball in the middle of the penalty territory.
At this stage the Rangers dominated the holding of the ball, but the home defense was impenetrable for them, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was usually not very busy.
The same picture of the game was also in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman's legs were stopped by Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow's legs were not met by another standard Livingston situation.
Two penalt kicks came in after Halket's attack on Glenn Middleton's replacement and another by hand.
"Phenomen" from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, and on their way up they continued to overcome expectations.
Their style of games and the men have nearly changed since returning to the top, but the great praise deserves Holt for the team's upheaval from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was great, led a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral on standby all along.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerard, but they don't reach these standards anymore.
Their limbs were shabby – only once penetrated the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan awaited mixed welcome in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the sky was blue, and all the smiles themselves.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany, whose aim is to fix the relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on a number of topics, including human rights, freedom of the press and the admission of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
The Turkish population outside Turkey is the largest in this town.
Security police prevented 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque for security reasons, but in the vicinity there were many supporters who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them were Kurds – protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his politics and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
Opposition protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
An accident in Deptford: The cyclist died after a car collision
In London, a cyclist died after a car crash.
An accident occurred at around 10:15 local time near Bestwood Street with busy Evelyn Street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead.
The death occurred only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half away from the Saturday tragedy of the Childers Street accident when the driver was caught.
Metro police said police are now trying to identify a man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternate routes and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured during riots in a high - security prison.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sundays around 9:30 local time and they still persist.
In order to cope with the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, specialised guards from the Tornado team were called.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
The prison speaker said: “When the ongoing incident in Long Lartin Prison was handled, prisoners were given special training.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisoners, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer periods behind bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden had ended up assaulting a hospital prisoner.
And in October last year, organized units were called to the prison due to serious disturbances in which the staff were attacked by bulletballs.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City floods (the area where it is dry can benefit)
It is not usual for Arizona to hit the tropical bubble of low pressure, but that is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert south-west and brings the risk of floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued a warning against floods on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona for Southern and Eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday and rain will be brought in on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “from 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or pressure below 320 km from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Hurricanes predict precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona, up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the Northwest desert, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Coat, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local hills up to 100 mm.
For those who are not threatened by floods, the rain of Rosy may be a blessing because the area hit dry.
The floods are a very serious thing, but they may also help somewhere because the Southwest of the United States has just hit a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the weather.com server says that Arizona is experiencing more than 40% of Arizona at least “extreme dry”, which is the second highest category.
The road to Hurricane Rosa first leads to Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the strength of the hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will be moving at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and will therefore be lost in power.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, which represents a major risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, total precipitation is expected to occur between 75 and 150 mm, with up to 250 mm,” the weather.com server states.
Rosa then travels like a tropical storm across Mexico north and on Tuesday morning, they arrive at the Arizona border. She will pass through Arizona and enter Southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risk to Russia or its remains is expected to be very severe precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert south-west of the US," the National Centre for Hurricanes informs.
These rains are expected to cause deadly floods and floods in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20 - year - old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16 - year - old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to a hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As the police from Avon and Somerset reported, young men aged 17 to 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who might have a record of what happened on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “inculced wickedness and anger” Democratic parties
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the carefree and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that during the process of his nomination, Kavanaugh “took at the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh told Congress on Thursday where he strongly and emotionally refused to complain to Christine Blasey Ford that several decades ago, when she was a teenager, he sexually assaulted her.
Ford also spoke on the charges against her.
The president said on Saturday that on that day "the American witnesses of Kavanaugh were the greatness and quality and courage".
He said to his West Virginia supporters that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the most excellent legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service in his account”.
The President indirectly attacked the Kavanaugh nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to participate in the elections in the mid-term.
"Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't run, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump declared that the Democrats had decided to "resist" and "resistance".
The advisor of the Republican side said to CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on Senate soil is expected no later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and victims are still growing
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the large earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of whom were swept away by huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the beach in Palu. However, as many as six meters of waves hit the coastline, many people killed and destroyed everything that was standing in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they fell into the waves for the victim," said the speaker of the Indonesian agency for the relief of the BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugro's disaster at the briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave did not go by itself, took cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugro said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami wave spread at 800 km/h on the open sea.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pala.
The air photographs published by the Disaster Reduction Agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences were shaken by the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released by Friday’s strong shocks was approximately 200 times the force of the atomic bomb dropped in the second world war on Hiroshima.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have increased the tsunami waves.
Nugro described the damage as “great” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels were collapsed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims had been found trapped under wreckage, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugro was informed that the amount of casualties and damage could be higher on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, near the earthquake epicenter.
According to him, the communication was "extremely contaminated without any information" from Donggala.
In his statement, the Red Cross stated that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers are heading to the affected places.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get much worse," says the statement.
On Saturday, the agency received considerable criticism because it failed to inform that Palu was affected by the tsunami, even though the authorities indicated that waves had come at a time when warnings had been issued.
On amateur images shared on social media, it is heard that a man on the upper floor of the building screams desperately warning people on the street from the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the coast will hit the water wall, which carries buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to verify the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami waves caused a major loss of electricity that interrupted communications around Palu, so the authorities could only coordinate rescue work difficult.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only to transport aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Pala on Saturday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala came to the city of Paula, where employees hide in shelters from tents built in the yard of the office building, they saw images of destruction on the way, says Mr. Doseb.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began to work sadly in disaster relief activities, some complained that foreign workers with great experience could not come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad may begin to flow to the place of the calamite until the zone of national disaster is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," says the speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross, Aulia Arriani.
“If the government says “OK, this is a national disaster”, we can start international aid, but this is not the case yet.”
When the second night occurred in Paul after Friday’s earthquake and the tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be those miracles that would make the dark stories of natural disasters more difficult to tell.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics released a woman who had been imprisoned under the wreckage of her mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists at the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Another of the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon outlined how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community had learned about the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages through WhatsApp to contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But instead of a couple of blue checkers, his message ended with a grey mark.
"I think it means that the reports have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took 26 750 USD during the addition of ATM in Newport on the Lefte
According to the Newport Police Department's press report, the robbers cut 26,750 USD off on Friday morning to Brink's employees while supplementing the ATM at Newport on the Lefte.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car emptied the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to invest more in it.
When he did, another man “went out behind the employees of Brink” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in an ATM.
According to the press report, a number of suspects were seen running from the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
Tell the police in Newport at the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: "Being formally known as Kanye West."
One-four-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while and pseudonym has been used as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should list his new Yandhi album.
In the show he replaces singer Ariane Grande, who canceled her participation for “sensitive reasons” as the creator of the show.
West said earlier that the word for him, in addition to shortening the existing professional name, also had religious significance.
"In my opinion, "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where you mean," West was heard at the beginning of this year when he talked about his album with Big Boy's radio moderator.
"So it is you, it is us, it is us.
It's changed from Kanya, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
The name has changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known at different times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
The former East associate JAY-Z wrote his name alternately with the link without him and with large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO vowed not to use an army against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador undertook never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "never will use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
At a time when the left-wing student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers started shooting at people on October 2, 1968 for peaceful demonstrations in the square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador undertook to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who study and by opening other free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education dragged young people into criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published notices about AI, although the US as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China has implemented a plan that wants to be a champion in innovation AI by 2030.
"The doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC that doubling funding could double the chance that the next major AI discovery would be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “Supervelmonics AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most significant AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player in the Othell game, and later he was a research director at Microsoft and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated the previous US government technological competition, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when others would help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"Academic peaks do not lead China, but corporations," Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Changes in immigration policy could also help to improve efforts in the AI area, according to Lee the United States.
"I think the doctorate holders in the AI field should be automatically offered the green card," he says.
The National Council of China released a plan for the development of the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides finance to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organisations give money to researchers in the USA, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Defense Department founded this year a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is supposed to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an Election Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it was investing $2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
With regard to the NSF Foundation, it now invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
However, the US legislation, which wanted to create a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has failed for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum whether they want to change the name of the country
People from Macedonia voted Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve several decades of old conflict with Greece, which blocks requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a right in its territory and therefore promised the entry of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
Both governments have concluded an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority Slovak population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott raised doubts as to whether at least 50 percent of the voters needed to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with an agreement with Greece coming?"
The supporters of the change in name, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zaeva, argue that it is a price worth paying to Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, who could join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska of Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but sufficient members of Parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission indicated that no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
However, only 16 per cent of the vote was cast compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters finally cast their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voters from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko give their votes in the Macedonian referendum on a change of name that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small podium and pulls chairs in front of tents built by people who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with a head raised, not a door for the service," Kavadarkov says.
"We are poor countries, but we have our pride.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate above 20%, so much needed investment.
"I think that the great majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
The result “yes” would, according to him, be “a confirmation of our future”.
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, the referendum could take place between 30 and 43 percent of voters – which is less than the required participation.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV's Macedonian station found that 57 percent of respondents voted on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be delayed by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious blow to the politics of the Western government since its onset in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has come for a goal through Brighton's entire defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took over Brighton's defense on Saturday and secured Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguera’s use, his goal appeared ridiculously easy at 65 minutes.
It all started with the transfer that the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
Prosprinted between three brats and got into an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the outskirts of the penal territory of Brighton, one defender passed and several others passed.
Next time on the left, he found Sterling.
An English attacker knocked the ball back in the penitential territory to Aguer, who, rightfully, beat the goalkeeper Brighton Mathew Ryan to the right side of the network.
“Aguero has trouble with his legs,” reported City Pep Guardiola.
"We said he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
The starting advantage for Sky Blues in this game Premier League has arranged Sterling.
This goal fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to the remote bar.
Attacker Sky Blues took the ball into the net just before he slipped off the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. with Hoffenheim in the League of Masters at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of Rockyes.
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff fight, there were not many reasons to re-enter.
But the eternally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on Sunday as a pitcher in the match against Colorado Rockies – but only if they have Rockies who lead the NL West by one game over Los Angeles Dodgers, the hope of play-off.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night by winning 5-2 over Nationals, but still want to get their first title in the division.
"Even if we're not playing at anything, we can at least throw ourselves because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with the greatest effort I'll ever experience this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play it?"
Nationals haven't announced who's going to start on Sunday, but they're supposed to be leaning on Scherzer in such a situation.
For Schierer, that would be the 34th start, training and pitching on Thursday, when he usually has a day off.
The original Washington pitcher has 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 Strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts in this season.
Trump stepped up for a meeting in West Virginia
The President indirectly expressed his views on the situation around his candidate in the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for the Republics to participate in elections in the mid-term term.
“In November, everything we have accomplished will be at stake.
One of the most important choices of our lives remains for five weeks.
It's one of the big, big, I don't run, but we're still on the move, and I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the resistance.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, decided for "resistance and obstruction".
“And you see it in the last four days,” he added, saying, “Democrats are “woe and wicked and lying.”
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which led to a loud rise in the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Um, what?
No, no, wait -- that was really bad body talk -- the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse power of opinion.
He is intolerant to those who express their views
When the activists from the Moment in my local side voted for my reminder, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to say that they are not welcome – because they have sincerely said their opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way, because she was adamantly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, they criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar matters that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The announcement of the Friday meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East stated that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years I've been a local member of parliament for the Labour Party were a meeting of the GC on Friday night.
Unfortunately, most meetings are not going so far, and the promise of a "more gracious, kind" policy has long been forgotten if ever started with it.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged to be acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader. Colleagues, whom I previously thought we had similar political views, expected me to turn 180° and stand up for positions I could not otherwise agree with – whether it is national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn't matter what I say – then the tyranny of social networking is followed, where they call for my appeal, condemn the politics of the center and tell me I shouldn't be on the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the tide of sexist or racist insults every day but will never retreat.
One aspect of this era of politics, which I am most disappointed with, is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the diverse stream of opinion and with every proposal to express mistrust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
In the past two years, I have been counseled many times to hold back, not so much to hear, and then “I’ll be fine. ”
But that's not what I went to politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a school student 32 years ago, the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who had let my class of general school literally fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or minister of government.
I've never hidden my politics or my last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with existing leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that if the country is streaming into Brexit, which will harm the households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not addressed to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of appeal or political pragmatism will deter me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late fives a little distorted the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved in this wonderfully entertaining game Tennent's Premiership triumph.
Now they're at the head of the table, like the only unbeatable.
After all, it was an excellent defense and a better use of chances, which helped the home to win, and the coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
"In our fights we have passed the great trials and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All the honors of Ayru have taken better chances than we have. ”
Five of Grant Anderson's 14th minute, changed by Frazier Climate, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released for the match Warriors, enabled Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot gained an unaltered five.
Climate increased Ayru's lead by penalto and then half-time he scored and turned a solo experiment, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well and five Patrick Anderson, changed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who left the playground on the stretchers, and when the game started playing again, Ayr leaped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowall, who was changed by Climate.
Deputy Captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose used the players again thanks to the unaltered five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
Homebound, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clima without the ball, MacPherson put the ball in penalt order behind the progressive maul Ayru.
Clemo changed, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for five domestics.
The Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is moving into the field of hospitality. It turns out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A six-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, which he writes and plays with Greg Hemphil's long-time comedy partner.
The doppelganger reported that the coming ninth series would be the last series of series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, Adriftmorn Limited is the director of the company.
Herec refused to comment, but the source of the journal Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in a “suspecting business in restaurants” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours: intra-terranean Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the seaside headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Above the public buildings lies the blue flag in the color of the ocean.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca for Amazon are described as saying: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to gain it."
In all of the interior of Bolivia there is still a vivid memory of the coast, which the country lost in favour of Chile in the bloody war on resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to reawaken the Pacific.
These desires may be the biggest in a few decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the international court, which should fall on 1 October after five years of negotiation.
"The pain has energy, the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive result," says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decisions of MSD on large screens across the country with the hope that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of the Bolivian claim that – after many decades of interrupted talks – Chile must act on the granting of sovereign access to the sea.
The charismatic indigenous President of Bolivia Eva Morales – who has a controversial battle to re-election next year – is also very interested in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he declared at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favour of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change very much.
This United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to summon someone from the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible interviews.
The fact that MSD's decision comes only six months after the last arguments have been made shows that the case “was not complex” as Paz Zarat says, the Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, not only have they not supported Bolivia, but they may have stopped her.
"The issues of access to the sea have been strengthened by the existing Bolivian government," says Zarat.
It adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened all the remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again act, but after this it will be extremely difficult to lead a discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were unusually swift.
Monday will bring "an extraordinary opportunity for Bolivia to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with each other," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political beaver.
"It will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says there won't be any nuclear disarmament unless the United States can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never arm their nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to make promises made at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after it seems that U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is about to restart the nuclear diplomacy that has stuck at a dead end for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri says it is “to pay for hope” that the ongoing sanctions and the US's opposition to the declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes hit the North on its knees.
Washington is careful about consenting to the declaration, unless Phjongjang first takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general scepticism that Phjongjang is serious about giving up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Phjongjang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris parades show that your fashion stores are about to get the latest trend in huge head coverings
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a number of shaken huge headgears for their spring/summer 2019 collection at a parade that captured everyone at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats this summer flooded Instagram and these designers sent their exciting creations to the piers.
Valentin's exhibition piece was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge resembling feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized supplements were decorated melons, a witch hat and even pineapples – but they are not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment even with snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a crown with a melted ice cream.
And if you continue with great fashion – you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could reach fashion stores as well.
Overgrown hats come after “La Bomba”, a straw with a half-meter wide creme that was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creation to the parade pier – the straw of the beach bag, which is almost as big as the model in the swimsuits that carry it.
Dark orange raffi bag lined with raffies and covered with white leather sleeves was in Paris week fashion exhibition piece of collection La Riviera spring/summer 2019 from Jacques.
Stylish celebrity Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion shops for the next summer — given that the designer has been so successful with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessively large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
The Scottish independent schools have a number of academic successes, and it continues in 2018 with other excellent results of the exams. Individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other community activities are just saying that.
These schools have over 30,000 pupils in all of Scotland, representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and trying to ensure the best possible level of service for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually adapted school curricula, we observe that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person a language he understands, it goes right to his head.
If you speak his own language to him, it goes right to his heart."
It is an important observation that if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of this year's tests show that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the lower levels of success being independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students achieved the best A mark.
Data collected from 74 member schools of SCIS show that 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved the highest grade A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects which pupils choose are equally relevant in the study plans of independent and other schools as the subjects STEM (science, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, for reasons that employers identify as a problem in renting vacancies, 17 per cent of lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
Since more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career you choose, if you have learned a second language, in the future you will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person speaking multiple languages automatically gets a advantage from competition.
According to the survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of them could not speak foreign languages well enough to conduct a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15%, being French.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially those of developing economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school is different from what language it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important to Britain in the view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have a choice of several languages at independent schools with teachers who are professionals in the field.
Scottish independent schools aim to provide an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever they may expect in the future.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and finesse to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien only ferre.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron introduces himself in the Lakers for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James getting in Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, are soon about to arrive.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday opening game of the San Diego event against Denver Nuggets.
But it's still not clear how many minutes it'll take.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to only play a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the foreplay.
"At this stage of my career, I do not need a pre-season fight," he said.
Trump performances in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a campaign wave in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
It's the first of five birthday parties scheduled for next week, including friendly stops, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate to a vacant post in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to obtain support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because the Republicans stand in November elections against the risk of losing Congress.
What time does Trump's performance begin tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time, today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's uterus in West Virginia online below via live upload on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about hearing a candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very tense for charges of inappropriate sexual behavior.
But the main objective of this party wave is to help the Republicans build momentum before the November elections.
According to Reuters, campaign organizers President Trumpa say that the five meetings next week are intended to “add energy to volunteers and supporters to try to protect and expand the majority of the representatives of the Senate and the House”.
"The control over the Senate is so important for his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible in this busy campaign season," said Reuters spokesman Trump's campaign, who did not want to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, fans from "Ohia and Pennsylvania" could come to the reception at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and watch it from Pittsburgh.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits Western Virginia, in which he gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come to help him with his research," says a political scientist at Simon Haeder University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team has shown that the stomach has to fight to keep hope from Sunday's singles
After three single-player games, a Saturday couple can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The floating shuttle is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe it, and most of all in these competitions.
So where's the pendulum going to go now?
"They saw six points and now they're four, so we take it so that the pendulum is probably moving a little towards us," said Jordan Speth at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, leads by four points, and 12 of them remain.
As Spith says, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that can cheer them up, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and everyone can boast three points out of four.
Spith was deadly when he moved from the expanse to the green, and he set an example.
The famous screams increased still in the continuation of his wheel when he managed the key path to win the entire match when he and Tomas were two holes behind.
His putt, who won a 15-hole match, met with a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not yet out there.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," said Pete.
That's all any of these players left.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Pete and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder pup.
Strange but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit a hole on Saturday afternoon, but last Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again Friday morning."
This process and the way the energy flows both towards a violent audience, so it confirms from him that these are players for Sunday's victory, and that by the sunset, there will be no more favorite player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best for both of us at the same time on a different hole.
However, the talk of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly cooperated with Sergei Garcia, hero's morning game with four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The pit and two dabs in the front nine buried Spaniards and Swedes in an abyss from which they no longer climbed.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of it.
The games of two couples on two balls are so fascinating when you closely monitor the interactions of couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't get, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a strong lead in the past day, but this game of two couples has also shown that the US team has a stomach for fighting, which some, particularly from states, have doubted.
Until the final day Ryder Cup leads Europe with score of 10-6 points
Europe gains a healthy advantage until the last day Ryder Cup then from the Saturday games twins on two balls came out with a score of 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won nearly twice over the wrestling Tiger Woods, decided to make four cuts in Le Golf National.
The European Party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games to two balls with an American side which failed in series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in fours, won two matches, but they couldn't get to deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points behind him, while he and Molinari, who after the sensational weekend received the nickname "Molliwood", are the second couple to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After the defeat of the Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game on two balls and then they beat the tired Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambaau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who took two games on Saturday, showed occasional brilliance flashes, but now he lost 19 of his 29 games in two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after the morning game on two balls, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the game of twins on the 2–1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Köpky - the number ones and the threes in the world's ladder.
Europe, however, did not have this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris won on the whole line.
The three-time winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas pulled two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 win over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter on two balls and came back later to defeat the Puulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a pair game, even though he lost two first holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-game, although as a defending Fury Party only needs a draw to get trophies.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that there is a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says that “in no case” does not arm unilaterally and without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continuing UN sanctions had deepened their distrust of the United States, and under such circumstances the country would never surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general meeting that North Korea had adopted “significant measures of goodwill” in the past year, such as the halting of nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and the promise of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see a corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to disarm unilaterally."
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "progressive" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every gradual step, his statement appeared to be significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation just because it had already been passed by Phjongjang in the past.
Ri mentioned the joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the American president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the war between 1950 and 53, but the United States has said that Phjongjang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted calls for the release of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States is insisting on the “denuclearisation of the first” and increasing the pressure on sanctions to impose their objectives and even object to the “declaration of the end of the war”” said Ri.
"The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who don't know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings of Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea and not the USA were to be a side of the issue of denuclearisation, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have occurred in such a pathetic situation.”
However, the tone of Riho's speech was dramatically different from last year's when he told the UN general assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles in the U.S. territory was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump described Kim as "a rocket man" as a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations Trump, which threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work must still be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for it, he said: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Phjongjang for the measures taken.
However, Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue without delay and without interruption until we realize a complete, final, certified denuclearisation”
The Security Council unanimously supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to suppress the financing of nuclear programmes and programmes of Phjongjang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly side and Pompeo said he would visit Pjjongjang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last journey did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made just so that North Korea declared that he had been up to the "gangster requirements" within hours.
North Korea has committed itself this month to meeting with Moon to dismantle the missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States adopts “appropriate measures”.
He said that Kim had announced to him that the "appropriate measures", in which he hoped, were the security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and aimed to normalise relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard attend a course to teach them sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all its students sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture of the studio all the night when students sleep and encourage caffeine.
The academics have found that students at the world's most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the foundations of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a hospital specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital who is thought to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you only telling me this now, in my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he said for The Telegraph.
The course that was first introduced this year explains to the students basic information on how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an executive director of the University's medical services, said that the university decided to take a course after finding out that the students were really sleepless during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of student dorms where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, tennis and books on caffeine and light effects and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In another part, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behaviour of students will not change immediately.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking on health," added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride in “studying all night” still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is also growing.
A sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of a student to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even so that sleep deprivation does not occur because it switches the brain to a hunger regime, so the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to design a course that during last year's first year at Harvard graduated from one of his classes.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended that students consider setting the alarm for a time when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which may dispel your circadian rhythm, which leads to problems with sleepiness.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga sank Gerrard's man
Rangers suffered another loss when the hit by Dolly Mengy confirmed the dissatisfaction of Steven Gerrard with the 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side tried to mark its first victory from February 4th to February 1st triumph on St Johnston, but the Gary Holt team caused only the second defeat of Gerard in 18 games as a manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers team seemed without inspiration and determination to settle down.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingstone climbs to the third and right behind the Hibernian team to the difference between one goal.
And there could be other problems, Rangers, after what had to be treated with head injury by the Calum Spence liner after it was probably hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which ran around Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who last week took the point of Hearts and would be delighted how his well-trained men strangled their rivals at every turn.
Rangers may have controlled the holding, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were to score only two minutes after the beginning, when Menga first let Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's goal, but the backer buried his big chance.
The distant free kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halketta, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back of his post.
Rangers took control, but it seemed there'd be more hope in the last third than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a quarter-hour penalte when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson wiped out the Colombian challenge from the table.
Rangers managed only two shots to the target in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassana Coulibaly and a short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener after 34 minutes might have been against the running of the game, no one can deny that they've earned it for the work.
Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and made Meng an easy finish.
Gerrard took action at the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate result when the wing collapsed into Morelos, but impeccable Kelly broke through from the line and the attack blocked.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metal one long ball after the other.
Holt's side could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another late claim for punishment when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: Inventor Geiger's reader
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old, and it's still coming... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter became a permanent pop culture at that time, as in the 1950 "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of these seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in God's name is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger reader used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms caused by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: "Well, yeah, now it's really scratching!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But an invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into a laboratory
Then they can “see” proteins, which are common to many cancers, and then reinjected
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman who is being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect dangerous cells has suffered ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation into the laboratory, so they can “see” proteins common to many cancers called HER2 and then be reinjected into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “has been driving the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were collected from patients and “learned” to focus on cancer cells, was already promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West took part in the pro-trump sermon, in his maga hat, after his performance at the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was invited to study Saturday Night Live after a confused performance, during which he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night with the name Ghost Town in which he was wearing the hat of Make America Great Against, he started swimming at the Democrats and repeated his support of President Trump.
"I often talk to white people, and they say to you, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I had been practicing racism, I wouldn't have been in America for a long time," he said.
SNL launched a parade with Matt Damon in the lead role in which the Hollywood star made fun of the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the senate court committee on charges of raping Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's theatrical speech was recorded on social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock West.
West also complained to the viewers that he had his head ornament eaten well backstage.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
It's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place," Washington Examiner said.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his Superman suit because it means you can't say what I'm supposed to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only served to create an audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL looked upset, in despair, says Variety, and one person even said: “The entire studio was completely silent.”
Westa was invited as a late replacement for a singer, Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing song I Love dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leading conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU THAT SES HAD DAVIVED DAVU.”
But visiting talk show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was simply who he was, and that is absolutely amazing."
“But I DON’T WANT to reward someone (the purchase of his music or his clothing or the support of his “art”, about whom I believe he represents and broadcasts into the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Like us," she added.
Before the performance, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and walk in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, used to be called Snoop Lion and, of course, the late Prince musical legend, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Blaming for attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after killing a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
There was an incident in Ballyhackamora, the police said.
The defendant should stand trial in Belfast on Monday.
The alleged charges shall be reviewed by the State representative.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington launched into toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy of the HBO series.
A 31-year-old actor, however, stepped out of the stereotype macho hero and said that such role on the screen meant that young boys often feel that they must be claimed to earn respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit reportedly said he believed that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her star Rose Leslie’s throne, also 31, admitted that he was expressing himself strongly on the problem.
"At this moment I personally feel, quite strongly - what happened so bad with the masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach a young man about the problem we see here?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic men thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What do boys learn on television, on the streets, make them feel that it is necessary for each man to have his own side?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because young men have definitely changed for the worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel Games about thrones after the series was completed, because he has had enough "fights and horses".
Since November Kit will be playing in the restored Right West Sam Shepard, which is a story of a film producer and his brother, robbers.
The actor recently discovered that meeting his current wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever came out of the game of thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so he gave me my future family and my whole subsequent life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of love of the Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy of the Emmy series.
A couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China mentions a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official numbers, more than 820,000 people are affected by this virus.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 annually.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is reportedly still widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would avoid data from GOP senators, avoid the term "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
US Member Maxine Waters ruled on Saturday that a member of her staff had sent personal data from three Republican U.S. senators to the bishops of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were supported by “ultural” scientists and websites.
"False, lies and other contemptible lies," Waters said in her Twitter statement.
The information provided was reported to include home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S. senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate's hearings on allegations of sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
There was sometimes a leak after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which is the source of contributions, is linked to Waters' office and published information on the members of Waters' staff, Hill says.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a totally false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"Member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were the result of these fraudulent and false accusations - was by no means responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a totally false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including from former White House Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that there is no temperament to be a member of Congress."
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He mustn't be adversarial.
There must be no question about the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and not excited."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the critic of the Democrats with that of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had notified “the competent authorities and the authorities responsible for the criminal proceedings of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English again interferes with reviews – a weaker espionage parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in any new film with British trend, which seems to be the case of this revitalisation of Johnny English in a series of action parodys - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this cruel satire be about how obviously a bad nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this bulging, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to re-pack this thing in a completely new way - the name more than anything by signal that a wide comic design designed for an English speaking cinematographic audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who despite his bizarre claims on smoothie glamour has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a whisper from Mr. Bean and a big bite from the guy who sings the only tone in the Chariots of Fire sound at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
The position is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man, played by Atkinson in the forgotten TV commercials Barclaycard, who has left behind chaos.
In this last edition JE is one or two good times.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in the medieval armor, and the blades of the rotor snorted briefly about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels rather sublime and strangely overexcessive, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like it's meant for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy trampotes are so resourceful and focused, like Atkinson's silent film gaga in Mr. Bean's person.
The long-term assumption is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated a British super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to apprehensive agent in the service - to a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the prime minister, who is pomped and passionate by a character who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political non-popularity: Emma Thompson this favorite Theresa May character plays best, but there is nothing in the script.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that once every active spy is at risk, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as director in some luxury device, is also giving a record lesson on how to be a secret agent: there are some nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the Rock School.
English went back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his ex-long suffering partner, Bough, who was once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the captain of the sub, an affinity figure that Vicki Pepperdine may be a little wasteful.
So Batman and Robin are back in the business of the Secret Service task of Her Majesty, and they're meeting with the beautiful femme fatale of Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously subject to the charm of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the vicious Jason Volt, who is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their odysium full of flaky heels: masked as waiters will light the French restaurant; they will create chaos when they sneak into Volt's luxury yachts; and English will launch a clean anarchy when they try to get acquainted with the interior of Voltov's house using virtual reality.
All the essays are certainly ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and stormy it is, it has something on children's TV.
It's a pretty mild matter.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Laborists deny that they would develop a four-day work plan for Englishmen in a week to get paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is scheduled to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid in five.
The Party allegedly wants the CEOs to hand over the savings to workers resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still take the same reward.
Sources argue that this idea would "fit" the economic agenda of the party and plan to bend the country to the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changing economies.
A long - term member of the labyrinth stated for the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that falls within the party's position to balance the economy for the benefit of both the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, Green Party pledged a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, these aspirations are currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not our party’s policy and the party does not take it into account”.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's work conference to fill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to return the energy from the "anonymous directors" and "scientists" in the utility companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return to their total share, as the Labour Government could carry out “consumptions” on the basis of perceived guilt.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the company’s administrative boards and to create own-ownership funds that would transfer 10 % of the equity of private enterprises to employees who are entitled to pay their dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in a "60 minutes" series that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could have changed their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed his final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question whether the finding of the Office could be triggered by some Republican senators to seek their support.
In an interview on Sunday '60 minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open than his fellow South Carolina.
"I want to say, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it came to pass when the accusation came to light, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
However, Graham's decision is indescribable .
"I've already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh and it would mean a really explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied," Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see anything's going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has he done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York for the annual musical event, which offers a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission behind the end of world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival in the seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was introduced in 2012, is an extension of the Global Overty project, an international group in support of ending poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, e-mailing to the world leader, calling or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert in a really way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of "clicktivism" - people who feel that signing an online petition or leaving a tweet will change something?
Global Citizens says that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by their supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
He says that these actions have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and measures of more than $37 billion to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds provided have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British investor and realtor partnership, which committed to “help children grow to their full potential”, promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help with under-nutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a comment on social injustice in the form of substantiation in history," Project Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions called for by the U.K. to improve nutrition for the mother and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on our web pages, asking, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Witness replied: “It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as well as the great civil rights and the movement against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the members of this year's New York season to host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use a “block” Navy to defend Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington may “if necessary” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from falling into the markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's engagement in Syria - especially where it is working on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said allegedly.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity to use our Navy to ensure that maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of an event organised by a consumer energy alliance, a non-profit group that is considered in the US as a "voice of the energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to invest in or replace fuel," he said and at the same time refers to Russia as a "one-purpose" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes because Trump's administration is on a mission to strengthen the export of its fossilized natural gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of Trump’s administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin “rukojmy” Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure development and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States was intrigued by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The biggest German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "nearly look" at the 2020 presidential candidate, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the middle of the election, she would "nearly look" at the presidential candidate.
During the meeting of the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and repair our broken government, including the top woman's position," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I'll look closely at the presidential candidate."
Warren mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that she was “leading this country in the wrong direction”.
"I am fighting to the point of the bone what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts said the senator should not be running, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidate.
The survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent for and 48 per cent against the candidate.
Among the other highly built democratic names discussed in connection with the potential candidate by 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd decide officially in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after listing in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after his return may concern other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some injuries that our soldiers are returning to," said the audience for a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “an elephant in the room” and said of her son and other war veterans that“ they return a little differently, return to the reclamation, return and ask if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and airmen, and any other member of the army, give their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic assault on a woman, interfering with the report on domestic violence and holding a weapon in the drunk tank, said Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Vasil Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new measures of the American government, which suppresses the victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district on Friday in Washington issued a short report on Friday to support and challenge asylum seekers, the NBC said.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case, who handed over American Civil Liberties against Federal Policy in August.
She said that her partner "and his sons and members of the violent gang" had abused her, but American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers of the States supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new asylum policy in the US reversed the decision of the Board of Appeal for immigrants from 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants who fled from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine stated in his Friday statement that the new measures "ignor the decade of state, federal and international law".
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," a short friend said.
The lawyers further briefly argued that a policy that denies the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and will “adult the necessary work”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims who fled from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available for those who will leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or for political opinion," Sessiones said in his statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pala, where the number of victims has risen twice, race in search of survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum, who comforted her burning little boy in the evacuation center in the exhausted town of Palu.
"An ambulance will bring more bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking themselves up through the wet things and trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7,5 were crippled.
Some injuries, including the Two Harris, who suffered a fracture in the spine and shoulders, were resting at Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued severe subsequent shocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he felt that a violent earthquake shook his hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I was involved in the wall collapse," said Harris for Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay."
US Ambassador accuses China of "shocking" propaganda advertising
One week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page advertisement in the American daily, which dealt with the mutual advantages of trade between the USA and China, the American ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American prints to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday a paid surcharge of China Daily in the Des Moines register - the state of the biggest sales papers in Iowa - after he accused China of trying to interfere with the US Congress elections on November 6th.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the American elections indicated what the American leaders said that Reuters was a new phase of an exaggerating campaign by Washington to develop pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to include commercial promotion advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalation of trade war, which is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
The Chinese retaliatory sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican side, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, American ambassador to China and former longtime governor Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bully by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
“When spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American precious tradition of free expression and free press by placing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the unconcerned views that the Chinese might have on China's disturbing economic path, given that the media belongs to the company "China's Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to make the offer public” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans leave their voters to elections for the debacle with Kavanaugh, warn analysts
As many top republicans defend the candidate at the Supreme Judge Brett Kavanauga, who faces several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming elections they would learn a response, particularly from women.
Emotions around this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record already say they want to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be brought back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell's University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute efforts to investigate the FBI will be sufficient to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesman of the progressive MoveOn group, reported in D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted "The November is coming!" at a demonstration in the hall hall where the Republicans, who are in charge of the Justice Committee, decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be breaking records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was already high, that's true."
It could, however, be higher, especially among women who hesitate to vote in the suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years, who do not like the president but often do not go to elections."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailed her allegations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court's Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed it, resistance could follow.
"The confusion for the GOP was averted," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about voting in committee or final vote, nor about Kavanaugh sitting on a chair, it is also about how the Republicans handled it and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, US Director of Priorities, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in their view of who to believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with somewhat more sympathy for the other appointed.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, but 35 percent said that they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following pressure from Flakes FBI is currently investigating charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, quoted The Guardian as saying.
Ford testified before the senate court committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunk attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitalia at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web network plans to start a new internet and run Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a start that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project was “world domination”.
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “personal online data storage facility” or DS.
It may contain contact lists, list of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Disk, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all simultaneously.
What is exceptional on the personal online data repository is that it is entirely on the user to determine who will have access to any kind of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data”.
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to the CEO of John Bruce, to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some of the employees working on the project cooperated with the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking about "Facebook and Google" that they will bring about a complete change in where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in his contribution to the media published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion of net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A Spiritual Celebration That During World War I Received Viktorine Cross · Global Voices
One hundred years have been celebrated since the only church of the Church of England received the cross during World War I as a warrior.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the gunman killed him and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandkids discovered a monumental stone on Saturday during the Rushden parade.
One of his great - grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “genially symbolic ” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s triumphant act.
According to London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Lt Col Vann led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and strong shooting of field guns and machine guns."
Later he reached the first line and with the "highest courage" led the line forward, before he himself plunged into the firing field and knocked out three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna killed a German gunman on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that I could never do, but at the same time something that was humiliating. ”
Together with their brother Dr. James Vann, after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band youth group, they laid a candle.
Michael Vann said that he “felt great honor to be part of the show, ” adding that“ the courage of the true hero is being expressed by the support that many people will provide. ”
MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, and they got Peppa's pig instead.
Imagine what you've been waiting for all night to watch Bellator 206, just so your main event is denied.
The San José bill contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts took place in the UK all night long on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for each other's fight, the audience in Great Britain were amazed to see the news show on Peppa's pig show.
Some remained undisturbed after watching the game until the early morning hours.
One Twitter fan described the change in the broadcast to the children's show as "a certain form of the wrong joke."
"In accordance with the government regulation, such content is not suitable at 6 a.m. in the morning, and it is therefore necessary to broadcast children's shows," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communication of Bellator after being questioned about this transmission.
"Peppa's Pappa," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they would work on the program so that the audiences in the UK would be involved in the future.
"I think that when I think about broadcasting, we can probably do it," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we can't make it on Sundays, Mondays their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this program changed, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We reduce it to five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried to keep the promise to fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "liberal" for sexuality
The Olympic jumper in Tom Daley's water says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old sportsman said that he did not realize that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first disc Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Lawrne, said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that the possibility of becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular long-term director of Kirsty Young's long-term show had a few months off because of the disease.
Daley, who appeared as a wreck in Lavern’s first program, said that he felt “less valuable” than anyone else who grew up with him because“ it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls. ”
He said: “Until now these feelings of inferiority and other realities have given me strength and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “Someone, ” he said, not to disappoint anyone who might have found out about his sexuality.
The dual holder of the bronze Olympic Medal became a fighter for the rights of the LGBT movement with a high profile and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he heard from him because he felt lucky that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to add “hope ” to others.
This three-time world champion said he was in love with a man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “it was unprepared.”
Daley held the Oscar, who is 20 years older, took the last year, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"If you experience so much at such a young age – at his first Olympics he was when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later," he said that it was not easy to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar increases and fall.
A couple in June adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley said that he had “changed his whole point of view”.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style of "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are more things than the Golden Olympic Medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son got a name for his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father wasn't supposed to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him – you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized he was not invincible," he said.
Daley attended the 2012 Olympics for a year and won a bronze.
"I knew I had dreamt about it all my life – jumping in front of the sight of our home at the Olympic Games, I don't know a better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first composition – the stream from Heather Small – which resonated with him when the Olympics began and still produced goose skins in it.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on the bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson would have won a record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup game, but he would have had to adjust the form to prevent an unfortunate milestone from happening.
Mickelson, who played the event every two years on the record of the 12th, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the Saturday fourballs and foursomes to the bench.
Instead of spending five times as much of his main prize in the U.S. as he used to be in the center of action, he spent his day alternately between cheerleaders and a game in a row he hoped to repair what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the directest of the drivers, not even at the top of his career, so he is not the ideal choice for the narrow field Le Golf National, where a long particulated terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And if the golf course isn't quite disturbing about itself, then Mickeyson is facing the ninth Sunday match with the exact champion of British Open Francescu Molinari, who won all four games this week in the team with the new guy Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, avoided a quick onset, the Mickelson machete could prove to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband and gave nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, patted me on the back, gave me his hand around my shoulders and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"So much he believes.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame, and in the past even this week he has been so helpful to these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine him winning two machetes.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everybody else."
Mickelson overcomes Nick Fald's record in most of the west of Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson has achieved 18 victories, 20 prizes and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence to the team has yielded some immaterial results.
"He is funny, sarcastic, funny, enjoys making fun of people and is a great companion in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also had fun going to him this week, which was fun watching.
It's more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that great leadership heading into singles from the last days in Ryder Cup can easily be transformed into a uncomfortable ride.
Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderram, where the team led by Captain Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they reached the finish line with a completely close welcome of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still have to remember that in Valderram we had a big lead, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but only close," Bjorn said, on the picture, after watching when in 2018 we won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of the team showed me that it's not behind us.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go in there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all the points are on the board.
We have a target, and that's trying to get that trophy, and we're focusing on it.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, happy to see his players on a complicated golf course, added: “I would never have made it on my own.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and it's too hard.
It's great to be out with your partner when it's going well, but if you have to be there for yourself, your capacity of a golfer is fully checked.
That's the message you have to give to the players, get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spath and Justin Thomas, who gained three points from four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of this great turnout when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn to end up defeated when Europe reached the "Travel in Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players to head to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklyn, like in Medinah.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle fights.
That's why we set up the system and made the boys feel like you know, as if we were to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and confront Rory McIlroy in a top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of boys in this order, because I think it covers the whole way, Bjorn said about his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship has been rescheduled
The most recent German naval frigate was recognised in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least one more year due to faulty systems and snowy shores, local media report.
The operation of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand-new frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Di Zeit-citing spokesman army.
The ship was supposed to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after the delivery made the fate of this ambitious project uncomfortable.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg vessels will serve as replacement for the ageing frigates of Bremen class, which had already ordered the Navy in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies, such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include a long maintenance period – the latest frigates should be possible for up to two years outside the home port.
However, constant delays mean that top seagoing ships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces to overseas – will be obsolete by the time of entry into service, says Die Zeit.
The famous frigate F125 entered the newspapers last year when the German Navy officially refused to bring the vessel into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the manufacturer after the transfer.
Few were known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of fundamental “software errors and flaws on metal elements” of defects that would make a warship unusable in the battle.
Software failures were particularly important because the vessel of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will operate a crew of some 120 sailors – half of the workers needed on Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is overweighted, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy’s ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000tun vessel Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defects in metal elements, the problem is also the price of the entire project – including crew training.
It is said that out of the original 2.2 billion euros, the price has risen at a return of EUR 3.1 billion.
Problems with the most recent frigates have become important in particular in the light of recent warnings that German maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, confirmed that the maritime army indeed "comes to ships capable of planting".
This representative stated that the problems were constantly accumulated because old ships had been decommissioned but no replacements had been provided.
He lamented that none of the baden-Wuertemberg class frigates could become part of the Navy's equipment.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New discoveries research is under way at the bats ’ home in Scotland, as bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the discovery of research will culminate in a new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help to manage future activities for the preservation of this species.
The study, carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland association, will be followed by the bats of viscous and brown long and watery in the Inverewe Gardens Botanical Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas in this bat habitat, which will monitor the activity of bats throughout the year.
Staff and NHS volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings will reveal the frequency of the bats calling and what species do.
Subsequently, a map of habitat will be issued and a message will create a detailed landscape view of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for conservation of natural resources for NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help to identify the advantages of managing habitats, such as creating a meadow, and the best practice in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain in the past century have been largely abandoned.
They are threatened as a result of construction and territorial development affecting colonies and natural environments.
The risk can also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as traps on flies and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
But when hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a clever echo-location technique to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly carry out research, control of colonies, and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even established the first and only reserved bat reservations at the Threave headquarters in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager at David Thompson's residence says it's the ideal territory for them.
"We have a great area for bats here in Threave," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's too much that we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us understand better what they need to survive."
It stresses the importance of bat control before the start of maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one maternity nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protection and it is illegal to kill, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to join their hand and help.
She said, "About our bats and a lot of species that we don't know how their populations are doing, we still have a lot to learn about."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges as “false reports” and stated that people want to“ see ” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to file a complaint against the German daily Der Spiegel, who informed about these charges.
This Portuguese and the attacker for Juventus was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorgy in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her USD 375,000 to keep the case quiet, informing the Diary Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the release of the indictment information, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke live video on Instagram to his 142 million monitors and described the information as "false reports".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-fold holder of the Golden Ball in the camera.
"They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel's journal for unsubstantiated charges, which have been described as “an inadmissible notice of suspicion in the private field”.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will demand compensation for “moral damage in the amount of the corresponding severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights recently”.
The alleged incident was to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel suite and in the Las Vegas casino.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the casino where, according to the documentation submitted to the Clark County District District Court in Nevada, she was physically raped.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident Ronaldo knelt down and told her that he was “99 percent” of the “lord” and “one percent” failed.
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also declared that she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she “was afraid of retaliation” and feared “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to resume the procedure because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo at the time of the attack on the steps from the move to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer he bought it for 100 million euros by the famous Italian club Juve.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will “be forever sorry” if, after Brexit, it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing, said Secretary for Greg Clark.
He added that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK had informed BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"The deal is necessary," Clark said.
Japan's car states that the impact of the delay on the borders, if an agreement on Brexit is not concluded, can become a job.
In the Burnaston plant, where Auris and Avensis cars are manufactured, Toyota branded almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would notice a stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other motorists, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in Great Britain, spread fear of leaving the EU without an agreement as regards the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW states that it will close its mini car production plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers call the risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is in operation on the basis of the supply of 'right in time', with parts from suppliers in both Great Britain and the EU being delivered for cars produced on order within 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be border violations, leading to delays and lack of spare parts, according to the industry.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, mentioned the company, and the production would then be stopped.
Mr Clark stated that Theresa May's plans to revitalise future relations with the EU are "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the acquisition of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue in what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was not able to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long term it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of the jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years at the Burnaston plant and is chairman of the trade union, said that the members of the trade union are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places are gone, they will never come back.
The speaker said: "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
The meeting of Donald Trump at the high level with Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "removed next week" as he continues to fight for the post of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh, he told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is snooping at the work of Robert Mueller's special council, which examines interference with Russian elections, ties between Trump's party and Russia and possible judicial obstruction by the President.
Whether Trump releases the acting attorney general and threatens Mueller's independence, the Washington chats have been going on for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of disposing the president via 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the message.
Last Monday, however, he arrived in the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said that Rosenstein would not "be more comfortable" but then the meeting was delayed so that she would not study with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing, where they were giving testimony to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation of charges against Kavanaugh by the FBI, making the Senate's full vote late again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox Channel on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, and it may be necessary to move for another week in view of everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll always communicate up-to-date information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by the "divorce" of TV reporters, even when she said, "I disagree with the fact that they will perform."
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is organizing more meetings with questions and answers than any president before him," she added without giving evidence. "We looked at these numbers."
The conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We've been trying and you've seen that we've been doing this over the past few weeks and that there's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting senior representatives.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York City, the president probably showed why he and his released and sometimes bizarre look in front of the reporters he met.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to worry about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and their desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's SMEs sent a letter not even six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to resolving the costs of requests for settlement of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU are on the move to the expected decision this autumn.
However, the British Government is also taking steps in preparation for a possible scenario of withdrawal without agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reassure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
Our colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to the patients and communities we provide services to.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our solemn wish is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency surgical procedure after head injury
Empowered Tigers from Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, received an emergency surgical procedure after having suffered head injury in Saturday's defeat 31-27 from Vanderbilt Commodores' opponent, stated Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee Rod Reed, chief coach of state, told reporters that there had been a half-time injury.
"He came to the side line and simply collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines and then put it on the stretchers and prepared for further assessment.
The officer from Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had gone to Vanderbilt Medical Center for surgery.
Harris added that ‘no details on the type/range of injuries are available so far’ and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second man in a red T-shirt, graduated the first season for the state of Tennessee after the transfer from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, he had five overall moves, which means a total of 18 steps in the season.
Higher property tax will be charged to foreign buyers in the purchase of properties in Great Britain
A higher property tax will be charged to a foreign buyer when it buys real estate in the UK, and the money will be used to help homeless people within the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize Corby’s success, whose goal is to attract young voters
Increased property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in Great Britain
The increase of the Treasury by £120 million per year is expected to help homeless people without home.
Buyers from abroad will pay higher taxes on buying real estate when they buy real estate in Great Britain, while the money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May is announced today.
This act will be perceived as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's pulling young voters with promises to provide affordable accommodation and a focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in property purchase tax will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, while money will also strengthen the government's efforts to fight sleep without roofing over their heads.
In addition to the current obligation to pay property purchase taxes, including higher levels introduced two years ago for other houses and for rent purchases, the allowance may reach up to three percent.
It is assumed that up to £ 120 million per year will be raised in the Treasury.
Estimates say that the newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of Great Britain, which exorcises prices and makes it more difficult for those who buy for the first time to get to a ladder home.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
New principles emerged just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property purchases tax to help more young people get to their first house.
He accused large construction companies of holding the prices of properties high by taking up land, but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to repair the "inflammation home" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of remotely proposed housing reforms, including rent management and the end of the "irresponsible" evictions.
It also wants to increase the committee's powers to build new homes.
She said: “Last year, I said that I want to devote my efforts as prime minister to the renewal of the British dream — so that every new generation can have a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work here and form life.
It cannot be right, however, that it is easy for entities living in Britain and foreign companies to be able to buy houses as well as hardworking United Kingdom residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the despair of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross states that his "highest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at a certain stage.
42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of restoring the Northeastern club, which currently holds the third position in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership league last season.
"I wanted to play as a player in my country.
I got the rank B and it was," Ross said on the BBC Scotland's Sportsound channel.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampton with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that gets me back.
Such an opportunity would only come if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxiety over the consequences of such established names in such a big club when he had rejected the advance from Barnsley and Ipswich Town before.
"Success would have measured for me at that time the question of whether I could return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club undoubtedly belong to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him back there, but I'd probably feel successful if I could get the club back there."
Ross's only been leading a career for three years, he used to serve as an assistant boss in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from his descent to the third group and transformed St Mirren from a beginning decline to the winner of the title of the champions in the next season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he ever had in his career players at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably real intersections," recalls Alloa.
"I truly believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I was good, making good money, and enjoying proper heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through a week.
I'm still going through the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good about leadership.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I feel like I'm feeling the most in my whole adult life right now."
The entire interview can be heard on the Sportsound on Sunday 30th September at Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
Research has found that the perfect time for pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer wave of water increased the income of British pubs facing difficulties but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
Numbers show that groups of pubs and bars recorded a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July – but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the consulting firm CGA, who produced the final reports, said: “The stable sunlight and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as in previous June when the hospitality was increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in the marketing of restaurants by 1.8 percent in June has worsened further in July.
The pubs and bars that attract drinks have done as much as they've done so far as they've made their restaurants worse.
The pubs whose main markets are made of food also suffered by the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to have a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food dropped by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, of a leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restorative chains continue to fight, although the annual decline in sales by 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful in light of the pressures on costs.
For a long hot summer, there can be no worse time for food business operators and time to tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much needed relief."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industrial Sales Monitor for the British Hospod, Bars and Restaurants collects and analyzes data on performance from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is an established industrial scale in the sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that hides from his parents.
Every fifth child – only 11 years old – has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and educators, shows research
Research among 20,000 secondary school students has shown an increase in “false Instagram pages”
Reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that their parents know about.
Every fifth child – just 11 years old – creates accounts in social networks that hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils showed a rapid increase in “false instagram accounts” in which they share photographs.
Reports show concern that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a decorated “main” account, which parents know about, and at the same time they have a private account.
One mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found that her teenage girl was urging others to “rape her. ”
Research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmisses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, half admit to having private accounts.
Chief HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers have the temptation to create online spaces where their parents and educators cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish athletic committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the annual General Meeting of the Management Committee.
Doyle is the most appreciated light athlete and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those who run sports like those who will benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level in the past decade.
"Eilidh has an extensive respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Community, and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for the athletics in Scotland when he is a member of the Committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am delighted that I will be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I will be truly helpful and that I will help lead sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who won the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta at 200 and 400 metres, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular expert in BBC, could not walk after a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “Before a month, I had an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I recovered or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've managed to get better, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing practice today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
The milk sucker causing the mother's comparison to cows shares opinions online
The suction company divided online opinions by advertising, which compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
In the context of the placing on the market of ‘the world’’’’s first silent sucklers, an Envi-tech company has released a music video with an overlay that shows the freedom that the new suctioner gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cows to a song with the lyrics, "Yes, I finish, but you don't see a tail," and "If you didn't notice I wasn't changed, my boobs are here."
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, feed, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk.”
The advertisement, published on the corporate facebook page, however, triggered an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and it received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of which indicated that it sheds light on the “horory” of the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to abuse cows to advertise this product.
Just like we have to be pregnant and give birth so they can give milk, but their children are taken away a few days after delivery," says one of the comments.
Elvie suction is discreetly applied to breast-feeding (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Admittedly traumatic for a mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumping for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added, "This ad is completely off the grid."
There were also those who defended advertising, and one woman admitted that the song was considered “infectious”.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get the pump if I kept feeding.
When I suck, I feel like a bitch.
The commercial's a little crazy, but it's good to go.
It's a genius product," one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun commercial focused on mothers who suck milk (often at work or at toilets) and feel like “cows”.
It's not a commercial that's supposed to praise or lose the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet bras hidden under the bra.
The concept of campaigning is based on the observation that a lot of women sucking milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's suction is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and hides beautifully in the breast to breast-feed, so that women are given freedom of movement, the ability to hold the child and even when suckling out to walk.
Ana Balarin, a mother’s partner and ECD, commented: “Elvie’s suction is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a significant and provocative placing on the market.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and lactating cows, we wanted to point out the suckling of milk and all the challenges associated with it and to show a funny and reliable, incredible feeling of freedom that the new suction will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's suction got to the embassy.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski appeared on the pier, which the product had just used.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to state camp on the Texas border
Despite the fact that the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in particular because the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by Trump administration made placements more difficult for children with escorts more difficult.
Most accompanying were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of the danger of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to a child.
Risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to the arrest by Congress of hundreds of people who had requested the status of escorting themselves underage.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of those who are sponsors or sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them," said Mr. Albence.
According to the staff of asylum facilities, those who are trying to process matters more quickly on children have introduced new rules that will require some of them to be brought before the court until the month before the arrest, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
Many appear by calling in videoconferencing instead of personally declaring their case legal for an immigration judge.
Those who have no right to help will be deported quickly, according to the report.
The longer the baby is in custody, the more likely it will be to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to an explosion of anger or attempted escape, claims staff of asylum facilities and report from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers state that these concerns are raised in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs are that the child is starving, more likely to be overlooked, precisely because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children into a tent camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria announced that the American, French and Turkish "occupational ingredients" should be withdrawn immediately.
During the speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called after the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even though the eighth year of war is already in progress in the country.
Moual, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces in Syrian territory were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “it will be dealt with accordingly.”
"He must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the assembly.
Moual insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over”, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more lost their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy battle until we rid all the Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal strangers."
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria that mainly train Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of a war-stricken country.
In the release of refugees, Moual stated that there were good returns conditions for them and accused "some Western countries" of the "spreading of irrational fears" that caused the refugees to refuse to return.
"We have addressed international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Put down what a humanitarian matter should be."
The United States and the European Union warned that no recovery aid would be available for Syria until there was a political agreement between the Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last haven of Idlib created an opportunity to move further in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented the large-scale attack by Russian-protected Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moual pointed out, however, that the agreement has "clearly given deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military intervention would focus on jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters, with a link to Al-Qaed who will be "destroyed".
The Ambassador of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that the first meeting of the new committee, consisting of members of the government and opposition, will soon take place to design a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moual laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted “to the control of the articles of the existing Constitution” and issued a warning against the introduction.
Why Trump Wins In the Second Period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would have won further elections in 2020 if, as far as it is likely, many liberal observers, the prosecution and scandals of his office in the office of the President had not ended prematurely.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of the presidential period in history!”
Until now, there's no sign of the fatigue of the stalkers.
Since 2014, the survey in the main broadcast time has more than doubled to 1.05 million CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago according to Nielsen and "The Rachel Maddow Show" to MSNBC has increased the monitoring of cable television to 3.5 million watching the main night news.
"It's a heat that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of the "Designed Survivors" series on ABC drama about the secretary of the cabinet who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and the series “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, "Because it's funny with him," Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story happening in Washington could predict the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant families can reconnect and benefit the global economy.
Landing is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged trackers.
And yet it goes beyond whether you are an informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward is using "deep backup" resources for his book "Fear," pruning Paul Manafort's leather jackets worth $15,000 (the "grooming of arrogance" as stated by Washington Post) and the consequences of Mr. Trump Storm's "anatomy" by Daniels.
I'm not going to look at Super Maria again in the same way.
"Part of what he does and what arouses the feeling of reality show is that he feeds you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars document about the rotating c N.F.L. Trump show in which he appreciates Kim Chong-una.
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll be late.
When I got in touch with Mr Fleiss this week, it was sunny, out on the northern shore of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was snooping inside and watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't stand up, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was on a scale.
"I remember when we did all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the narrowest domestic races of medium-term elections
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flow of finance thanks to the reorganization of congresses districts, which generated two officials in the fight for the same chair.
This recently led to the transformation of the suburban district of Pittsburgh by the district democratic republic of Conor Lamb – which won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another office holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapped with the new 17.
After the High Court of Pennsylvania issued an opinion in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the republicans, there was a recast of the maps.
The race in the new 17th district launched a sharp financial divide between the financial branches of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the monitored March special elections until the 18th congressional district.
This chair was occupied by the Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Politicians give the Democrats a mild head start.
America considers punishing Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Mr. Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners courtfully moved Trump's organizational team.
The representatives of the foreign ministries decided to call on the US Directors of the diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Health Nauert in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
However, fines were only considered against Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included a reduction in financial assistance and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With the ongoing internal negotiations, the North American and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was perceived as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading for the US.
By mid-September, however, the senior executives explained that they wanted to continue the negotiations and effectively complete any fines considered for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now responsible for resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the signal that the administration is putting in place at the hearing, diplomats.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new infallible news from Washington.
The White House speaker, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American representatives, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their resources were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to government execution and also spoke under anonymity.
Study History
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possible obstruction of Mr Trump's exercise of law, which is now in the public record with a lot of evidence.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller has reportedly turned to whether Mr. Trump's campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there were to be an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr Trump would have to report for responsibility before this authority, as he is preparing to re-enter the vote, and eventually he would have been expected by a jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a series of "if", and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as well as for similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to organize a coup against Hitler, only to be built and supported by Western officials in Munich, Czechoslovakia.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the relentless march of democracy.
Americans are now facing a few similar critical moments.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, here's the man who runs the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had it on his mind from the moment the report announced that last year he had proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not in a state of health so that he could stand up for the presidency.
According to Mr Rosenstein, the version of the Times is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation of F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, are we going to vote in the middle of the term of office in Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will be waiting for a long dark night.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz with the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on a table with mestastas.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about encountering Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory over Rakušanas would have given them an impressive draw in Spain on Villarreal, earlier this month, a great hope for progress from the Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing on the playground for the first time in the season until the Villarreal 2-2 draw. However, he believes that Rangers can use this result as a reflective bridge for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went to the fight with the faith that we could take something, and we took the point.
Maybe we could reproduce it further at the end, but the whole trade was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we improved and again we were better.
It'll be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be hard, because in the last match, they played a good result. However, with viewers behind I'm sure we can push and it'll work out.
Last year was hard enough, with all my injuries and the changes in the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team's strong and the guys are really enjoying it, practice's good, too.
I hope we get into this right now, throw last season behind our heads, and we'll be successful."
Women worry about saving their pension.
Even though the participants had a clear idea of how to handle them, few people talked about this with family members.
About half of the students in the national study said that she and her partner were discussing the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they do not decide to discuss it with him," explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't reveal your wishes in advance.
Talk with your counselor and family about where and how to take care, because these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Call on your financial advisor: The counselor can help you find a way to cover these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be financed through traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurances that will help you pay these expenses, or through own insurance using your own funds, while you have the money.
Create your legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as possible.
Identify the healthcare provider, which will be a reliable person to oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider, too, the write-down of full power for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are paid in case you do not qualify for it.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your old parent urgently needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write these details into the written plan for you to be prepared.
"In the game are not just finances, but, for example, what are the names of medical doctors?" Martin asks.

The man in Ilfracombe was shot several times from an air carrier.
When a man walked home after a night's notice, he was hit by a few aerial shots.
About a 40-year-old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb in Devon when she was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hands.
The police described the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST as "a chance act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in the severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase further.
Since communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Donggala regency, which is the area north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicentre by a power of 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster broke out, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are a few key facts about Pala and Donggala Regent, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which is located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city had just celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regent stretching over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast off the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the population was 299,200.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, especially in the Donggal coastal region.
In the province, nickel mining is also important, but it is mainly concentrated in Moraly on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian organization Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggal have hit the tsunami several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donggal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit the west of Donggaly in 1996 when she demanded nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and there are earthquakes on a regular basis.
Here is a list of several of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in the last years:
2004: The great earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesia province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused the tsunami, which hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh Province.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumtra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, near the Sumtra coast.
2006: Earthquake with a force of 6.8 degrees hit the southmost island of Java in Indonesia and caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake with 7.6 degrees hit near Padang, the capital city of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: An Earthquake of 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumtra and caused tsunamis of a height of 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and ruined the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake hit Pidie Jay's Regent in Aceh province and caused destruction and panic because it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it didn't form a tsunami, but more than 100 died because of falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporarily imprisoned tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice president's candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
According to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin, living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, violations of domestic violence and prosecution.
According to police reports, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Pal's phone picked up her.
Palin has been sent to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained on an unsecured bond of $500, KTU reports.
According to the network report, he appeared at the court on Saturday, where he declared that he felt “indefinitely innocent” when he was questioned about his comments.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to $250,000 a year in prison and imprisonment.
At the same time, he was charged with a class B offense, which is punishable by a one-day prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin has to face a criminal complaint.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged assault on the police reported his mother, Sarah Palin, on the phone.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, violations of reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of stunning substances associated with the incident.
He allegedly hit his girlfriend's face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by groups of war veterans when her son’s violent behavior was linked to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An Earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are out of operation and in the coming days victims are expected to rise.
The earthquake hit directly on the edge of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital city of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Video footage of the moment of disaster appeared on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors require an exceptional death penalty for a suspect from a terrorist attack at NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York are requesting the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died – an exceptional punishment that has not been granted for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly attacked a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan by means of a rented truck, Home Depot, by whom he swept the walkers and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries – this is how the conditions for the death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to the judicial documents, both figures would constitute the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the federal grand jury attacked Saip with 22 crimes, such as murder charges in favour of extortion, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “significant planning and preparation”, claims the prosecutors and describes the way in which Saip's act was carried out, as a hideous, cruel and perverted.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijo, Hernan Ferruchi, Herna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca,” is hereby named.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York Court last handed down the death penalty.
Khalid Barnes, a defendant, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced in September 2009 to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, who had been shown conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal regret in court documents during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipov's charges, he told the authorities that he had been inspired to monitor the Islamic State's video on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also reported that he also demanded the suspension of the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defence attorneys representing Saipov, said that they were “evidently disappointed” by the decision of the plaintiffs.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and conviction for life without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," said Patton.
The team of Saip's defense attorneys had previously asked the prosecutor not to demand the death penalty.
According to the members of the Conservative Party, they should be entrusted with the negotiations on Brexit NIGEL FARAGE
During today's protest at the Conference of the Conservative Party, Nigel Farage undertook to "mobilise the army of the people".
The former leader of the United Kingdom's Independence Party stated that politicians must "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics – as suggested by one of their own Members of Theresa Maya should negotiate with the EU.
Order Conservative Member Peter Bone declared on the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be outside now” if he was the secretary for Brexit Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs Mayová faces in the reconciliation of her ranks, where there is a deep division, has been further highlighted by conservatives fighting for staying in the EU, who joined in a stand-alone protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his Chequers compromise plan under attack by the Brexits, the supporters of detention in the Union and the EU itself.
The allies insist on continuing their efforts to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and its “chaos”.
Mr Bone reported that the group of Leave Means Leave would meet in Solihull where he wanted to get used to Chequers.’
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
‘If he was in charge, we would be out today,’ he said.
Ambassador Wellingborough added: ,I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to give up on Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight world wars to have to listen.
In our own country we want to make our own laws.”
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is completely unnecessary'.
The conservative advocate of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, who also participated in the march, told reporters: 'I simply say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and we do not like him as members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be elected at all.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In an acute report for Mrs May, she says: 'Ministerial Presidents will keep their place while they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage stated that conservative politics must "get into a difficult situation" if they wish to betray their decisions made on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
'Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class,' he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're standing here today to tell them, we won't let you."
In an enthusiastic report, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the edge of the breakup of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"Now we mobilise the army of the people of this country, which has guaranteed us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the Great Britain, who will rule on our own."
In the meantime, the EU's supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had banners of Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend of this party's operation.
Labour MP Lord Adonis ridiculed conservatives for problems with the security of the party's application after the beginning of the conference.
‘These are people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technologies for Canada plus, for trouble-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ he added.
"It's all a farce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "think straight" a presidential candidate
US Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November elections, she will "think the presidential candidate" in good time.
Boston Globe reports that a democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking a November re-election against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself in the centre of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The event at Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall from the moment Trump settled in the office.
One of the participants asked her whether she was planning to apply for the office of the President.
Warren said that the time had come for “women to go to Washington and execute our broken government, which means a woman at the highest level.”
Suspect arrested from shooting Simse from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., on Saturday, announced that she had detained a suspect from Friday's shooting of a basketball player on the LSU Wayd Sims team.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson, at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video was released from Friday's shooting with a request to identify the man caught on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot Friday morning at a campus near the University of Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that was incompatible with life," Police Commander Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through web 247 sports.
Wade tried to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was moving at the crime scene, carrying a gun, and confessed to the murder of Wade Sims.
Simpson was shot and taken into custody in East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department without incident.
Six feet and six inches tall Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, of which 10 were last season, and the average had 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps for the game.
Great Price Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the World Master when the team's leadership won him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Just as Valtteri Bottas ended up Saturday's qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the team director of Mercedes would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the field of position and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two turns he defended his position and called on Vettel to attack a teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first, and let Hamilton catch up with the cars that circled the group's tail, which should be decisive.
The rider of Mercedes drove to the depa by wheel later and, after his departure, took his turn for Vettel. However, Hamilton went forward and in close combat he had to leave the Ferrari's inner path untidy so that he could defend himself in the third turn after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen left the back row of the driving field and at the end of the first round was on his 21st birthday in the lead.
He then ran after a large part of the race because he kept his original tires as long as possible to focus on a quick finish and could take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally he went to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight wheels he could no longer increase the pace and the Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he behaved like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and reward are the first two places," said Hamilton.
That was really bad body talk.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at Saturday's assembly because she insisted she hadn't published a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During the West Virginia meeting, he did not directly mention Ford’s statement to the Senate Judicial Commission, but instead stated that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are “wicked and repugnant and lying”.
"One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that is happening in Senar the last days when you see the anger when you see people angry and angry and repulsive and lying," he said.
"When you look at the publication and the publication and they say to you, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you take the leak?
Remember her answer... you published the document – oh, oh, oh, eh, eh?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, that's not it," he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent Ford a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to escape from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's complaint, nor did I disclose the case information," she told Kromis Feinstein, as The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, in her words, the president did not seem to believe that he was speaking to the assembly on Saturday evening: “I’ll tell you that this is a really bad talk of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The President continued his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats used these accusations for their own ends.
"They are determined to take back power by any available means.
You see the meanness, the disgust, they don't care who they're gonna hurt, who they have to knock into the ground to get back to power and to the steering wheel," the Mediate said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars fixed Friday's downfall in Elite League against Belfast Giants win Saturday's retaliatory in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The giants soon took two-brand leadership thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer's interventions.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for home before Dwyer brought back the Giants.
Francois Bouchard then compared the two goals to Dundee, though Lukas Lundvald Nielsen was assured of their victory.
It was the third defeat in Elite League in the season for the team of Adam Keefe, who succeeded in defeating 2-1 on Friday in Belfast.
Both teams met in the season for the fourth time, with all three previous matches controlled by the Giants players.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m., for Kendall McFaul's assistant, while David Rutherford signed up for Beauvilleer's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home again into the game at 13:10 p.m. and then Matt Marquart set up a goal for Cioni, who compared at 3:16 p.m.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabins for the first break, only in the lead when they noticed their second goal at the end of the first third.
Homers regrouped, and Bouchard managed to rebalance himself with the goal of a crossroad game at 27:37.
The joint work of Ciovie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen in his second third fight for the first time overtake the lead on Dundee's side and the same player secured his team's lead in half the final third.
Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic chief died to allow hundreds of people on board an aircraft to escape an earthquake.
The leader of air traffic in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died while overseeing the flight with hundreds of people on board safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many of them were missing after the tsunami shook the big earthquake on Friday.
Strong subsequent shocks flooded the area, and many remained trapped in the ruins of Palu.
But despite the fact that fellow 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung was running to save his life, he refused to leave his place in the wild with the overwhelming control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He remained in his position to make sure that the flight Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the run, could safely take off.
Then he jumped from the control tower down when he thought he was moving.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, spoke on the television channel Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We've arranged for a helicopter transport from Balipapan to Kalimantan to be transported to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
In the meantime, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster management indicated that access to the cities of Donggala, Siggi and Boutong was limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies remain unexplained under the wreck and many of them have still not been reached by the rescuers," said the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The waves in the devastated Palu have reached a height of up to six metres and mass funerals will take place in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft bring assistance and supplies to the affected sites.
Risa Kusum, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “An ambulance will bring more bodies here every minute.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the international red cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN station: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military components: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" said the CNN station.
Indonesia was hit this year by earthquakes in Lombo, killing more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that after a plane crash in a lagoon, one person is missing
A airline operating a flight that crashed in a lagoon on one of the Pacific Islands of Micronesia now said that one person was missing, and initially stated that all passengers and crew of 47 were safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that she was unable to find a traveling man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for details about this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships assisted in the rescue of other passengers and crews after the plane entered the water during an attempt to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the care of both Saturdays and were all in a stabilized state.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events, however, remains unclear.
The US Air Company and Navy reported that the plane arrived in the lagoon before the landing route.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed from a very small altitude.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that he, along with the others, managed to get water deep across the belt to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He further indicated that the crew panicked and shouted and that he himself suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy reported that the sailors who worked near the port pier repairs had helped rescue by means of an inflatable boat carrying passengers on shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades, a total of 111 people died in plane crashes with the PNG registration mark, but no accident occurred to Air Niuguni.
The analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive.
The prosecution ended its speech on Saturday in this case, in which a man is repeatedly convicted of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice in the person of his analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
The judge's analyst designed a script as he used the phone records of 29 accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis had been killed in Chambers' company on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous statement, listed The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone records showed that he was spending the night with Chambers, he found out he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then the police visited him.
Sanford was court-martialed in a congregation and testified that the day in question was not in town.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was "saling because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another disagreement was that Tellis indicated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks until the day she died.
However, mobile phone records indicate that these two knew each other only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calling and contact information from his phone.
"He removed it completely from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip Hop Trio wants to deal with negative views on this genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its beginning with political messages and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common met in the recent past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in Great Britain.
Another black girl?!
A New York tutor sues a couple for his "racist" text report
A New York parent sues a couple for her discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly sent text message from her mother, in which she was referred to as a "other black" text message.
A couple refused to be racists and compared the lawsuit I "torturing".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her dismay when the first day of work in 2016 she found out that the new tutor of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NOEÉÉ, ANOTHER Black,” she wrote to her husband, Plasco-Flaxman, in her text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her a note twice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman's "disturbed" fired Mrs. Maurice and said that she was just leaving the teacher who was African-American and was working really badly and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, she listed a New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple of compensations for getting out of work and requesting compensation for $350 per day of six months' engagement, for which she was hired at the beginning, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not happening," Post said this Friday and added, "I know this is discrimination."
However, the doppelganger struck with the fact that they were not racist, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they feared she could no longer be trusted after the insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are no racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, said the Post.
“But would you put your child in the hands of someone to whom you treated rudely, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “rescue” and stated that his wife was only caring for a two-month-old child and was in“ a very difficult situation”.
“Would you be following someone like this?
That is not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Even though the court still insists, the jury convicted the couple very quickly for their conduct and logic.
The publishers of the tales of Paddington's bear were afraid that readers did not identify with the talking bear, show the latest reports
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said to the rapporteur: “It is difficult to feel in the situation of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very funny to know, but now that we know the great success of Paddington's bear."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a small bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, added on the day of the 60th anniversary of the publication of a book that became a “sweethorn” point after his death last year.
To Paddington, described as “a very important member of her family, ” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, he was never any sissy," she said.
"But since Paddington was such a real figure for him, it was like you had a child who achieved something you could really be proud of.
I believe Paddington's success was viewed with this view.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his successes to Paddington only."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Louise Pasteura 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He regularly called me to tell me that this is really bad and that he does not expect it to come out," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"So I got a call from Nad, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye to her.
That's how I did it.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart running slowly lost its effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep it simple."
In the end, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, joined the plane with other passengers without revealing what a difficult test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head shut, all the time running through the faces of tears.
It's difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight that I felt a stunning understanding of Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women send postcards to prevent the self-sufficient on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send postcards to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can look for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, he took his life in 18 years.
"I don't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydia, said that her son was given a young cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up every room."
However, he left work before his death because he was “in a truly dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his sibling’s motionless body after taking his life.
Says Mrs. Davis: “I'm constantly worried about the impact that this will have on his life. ”
Mrs. Davis suggested postcards “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if their friends were involved.
Don't shut up - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies' summer friend, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He hasn't told me anything that he feels at the bottom, or depressed, nothing," he explains.
"We observed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
It was the worst day on Christmas Day – when the children opened gifts, didn't even look at them, nothing."
She said that the death of her partner was a great trauma to them, but that she must get through it gradually: “It can make a complete hole in the family.
It ripped us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on balance as the FBI launches its investigation.
"I thought that we could get something that was actually asked for – an investigation at a time of limitation, with a limited range – we could bring some unity into it," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee would “decomposit” because both parties would be buried in the partisan positions acquired.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The elections in the middle of the election period are only five weeks away from us, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are wrong to expect, this will lead to their fundamental weakening in their attempts to enforce the required man into office at the country's highest court.
George W. Bush phoned the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles their report?
The Senate will vote on this and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate can receive at least 50 votes, which enabled Vice President Mike Pencé to break the draw and confirm at the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea for Kim has "scattered"
The numbers of refugees from North Korea to South Korea have fallen since the beginning of the Kim Chong-Un government seven years ago, says the South Korean legislators.
Byeong-seug Park, quoting data from the South Korean Department for unification, said that there had been 1127 escapes in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that this was followed by stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates of required smugglers at the borders.
Pjongjang didn't make a public statement.
Today, the vast majority of refugees from the North are receiving an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Soul claims that 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, with the longest border North Korea has and is easier to cross than in a heavily demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often forced to repatriate them.
The relations between the North and the South – which are technically still in a state of war – have improved significantly in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of both countries met in Phjongjang for talks focused on stopped denuclearisation.
This took place in the historic June meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions for cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the US of not making any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way for us to be unilaterally disarmed," Mr Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit for service at the Supreme Court
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and said that thanks to her temper, she was not fit for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this note at a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but if any woman had ever shown such a theater, they would have called it "hysterical," Pelosi said in her reaction to Kavanaugh's Thursday's statement before the Senate Judicial Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still puberty.
during his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost screamed and choked when he was talking about his family and his years at high school.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and stated that their accusations against him were “gross and coordinated attack” by organised liberals who could not pass over Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was not able to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think that he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi replied negatively to the question whether she would seek to appeal for Kavanaugh in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had won the majority in the House.
"I will tell you this – if he does not tell Congress the truth, then he is not qualified not only for work at the Supreme Court, but also for the court he is working on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she had concerns about the potential earnings of Kavanaugh in the Court of Justice under the Act of Acceptable Care or Roe vs. Wade, because it is considered a conservative judge.
As part of the hearings preceding his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysterical, pretense person to come to court and expect us to just say, "Ye, that's beautiful," Pelosi said.
And women must rule it.
After verbal outbursts, months and years of agony, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we have anger," Mrs Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A good help was given to me by a woman who worked as a director somewhere and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she created a certain technique, which means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘ Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And that's how she kept doing it.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office where men dominated me. I once expressed my inextricable anger with crying. But older, always cold manager, who I was always a bit afraid of, grabbed my neck and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to get you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in the non-marriage affair on board the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea of her own presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she said to me laughing after 30 years.
“There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign had been running for a long time at that time, she could not keep up with her contributions and thus committed herself not to engage in the fight unless she obtained $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Does she think I'm going to get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, she was frustrated with a system that made it difficult for her to get money and focus on the voters rather than on delegates and on the anger over sexism that she completely choked with anger.
"You might think I've collapsed nervously," Mrs Schroeder said about how the press reacted to it.
"And you might have thought that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking what they might say to me on the gravestone.
"Plaal"?
Why the Chinese-American Trade War for Beijing Can Be Good
The initial balance of the US-China trade war has been overwhelming, and although the battle is far from being fought, according to experts, the gap between countries has long been beneficial to Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most significant escalations, however, saw the light of the world this week, when new tariffs were announced for 200 billion USD (150 billion GBP), which practically means taxation of half of Chinese trade exports to the USA.
Beijing has always responded, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of US goods.
China has tried to pay back the US with the same coins, and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy would kneel in its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to go back to the original tracks, it would mean giving up his demands, but public submission to the American requirements would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si Jin-pching.
Even so, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
“The reality is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger economic upheaval in both countries. This is far more dangerous than ever allowed by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, said Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual stated that the conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation in the territory is more stable and secure due to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas of destroyed terrorists into normal condition.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as well as unilateral economic measures that have focused on their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the war began in 2011.
Another six million inhabitants are still living in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual stated that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in the construction of the degraded country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurgents.
Europe responded strongly to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The team Evria won in Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field at the edge of the trouble in France.
The United States has now lost six on European soil, so Ryder Cupu has not won since 1993 in Europe.
Europe regained momentum when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points that were needed for the U.S. defeat.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then set off the ball in the water for 3 pairs of 16 holes and left the victory of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari then shined in all his bikes and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best score 5-0-0 since the existing tournament format was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spith was defeated by 5 and 4 European team players with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Oleseen of Denmark.
The highest rated world player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who apparently graduated his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia has become the best European player with 25.5 points gained in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy I got the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," said Garcia after winning Europe.
He gave a cup to his countryman John Rampo, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride that I defeated Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded a career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, which has won 14 greatest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The US team spent the whole weekend trying to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk, after dissatisfaction with the results of his team, said: “I’m proud of those boys, they actually fought.
This morning, we really warmed Europe to the heart.
We really didn't make it.
I'm slicing my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really very well.
We will regroup and, in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, we will move forward.
I like those 12 boys. I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really need to smile.
You've lost us."
