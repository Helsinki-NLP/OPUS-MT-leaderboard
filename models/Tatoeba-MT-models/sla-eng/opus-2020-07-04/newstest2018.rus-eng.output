President Vladimir Putin of Russia has signed a law on administrative liability for violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs.
The Act is intended to address the very serious problem of the failure of contracting authorities to comply with their obligations in the conduct of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, a situation where entrepreneurs could not obtain payment under public and municipal contracts already carried out was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia commissioned the Office of the Attorney-General to take special control of the problem.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to cope with bad faith contractors who had not been supported by the financing of contracts, they tried to avoid the obligation to pay and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payments under public orders, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has submitted 9.7 thousand submissions, resulting in disciplinary proceedings involving 4,5 thousand officials, 75 files for the administration, 533, and 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
However, these huge amounts have not been recovered as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Many, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs have led to more modest amounts of debt.
That's a typical case.
The small company leader won a several million roubles social services competition.
The person invested all his working capital, fully complied with the obligations but did not receive the money in due time.
The result is an increasing financial commie from salary debts, taxes, credits that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek assistance from the prosecution.
The problem has now been maximized in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of public and municipal debt identified by prosecutors of entities in the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt levels continue to be critical, the Office of the Public Prosecutor is operating under manual anti-crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally conducts visits with representatives of the local authorities, during which all violations and measures discovered by prosecutors are dealt with in a substantive manner.
Such operational meetings were already held in Yaroslavla and Yekaterinburg this year.
The Federal Act No. 189-FZ, on the introduction of amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which was signed by the President of the Russian Federation last week, will be able to improve the payment of payment discipline of public contracting authorities in a manner that would enable them to implement Federal Act No. 189-FZ on the introduction of amendments to the Code on Administrative Offences to establish the administrative responsibility of the contracting authority for the breach of the time and payment of goods (work, services) in the conduct of procurement for the provision of public and municipal needs.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Office of the Prosecutor.
The new law will complement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for violation by the contracting authority of the time and order of payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been punished by administrative authorities for a similar offence, he or she shall be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of entities of the Russian Federation have already been mandated to ensure the implementation of these legislative novels in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Unit has issued a movement warning in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued warnings to color travel to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads as follows: “Prevention for travellers of the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of Colorful Population, effective until 28 August 2017, calls on Afro-American travellers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly careful and to be more cautious in state travel in connection with a number of suspicious racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the territory of the State and brought here.”
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colored People, the group ' s announcement of a movement warning prompted a recent Misuri law, which made it more difficult for people to win claims related to discrimination and that state law enforcement agencies were often disproportionately targeted at minority targets.
“You have people being subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on roads because of the colour of the skin, they are beaten and killed," said the Canzas City Star newspaper Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colorful People of Missouri.
“We hear complaints more often than ever.”
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the organization to the United States.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Saunders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had completed his state trip and the State Police arrested him without accusing him of the crime.
Prevention also mentions a recent report from the State Attorney General ' s Office of Missouri that the possibility of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white people.
“The purpose of the warning is to keep people aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri”, Chapel said.
“People must be prepared in any way to take money with them for bail or to report to relatives travelling in the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime report, 100 hate crimes have been reported in Missouri for 2015, making the State the sixteenth in the State number of such violations.
Also, the warning of movement was a response to the new State of Missouri law, after which it would be more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings for travellers in Texas and Arizona after these states had adopted new immigration regulations requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which, according to the ACLU, had to increase the number of racially based checks.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed as a result of gunfire on a police patrol in Egypt
Unknownsts fired a police patrol in the Egyptian town of Isna, Reuters reports with reference to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
During the shooting, two persons, including one police officer, were killed and three were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the vehicle, followed by two armed men who were in the car shooting at law enforcement.
One of the instigators was detained and the other managed to hide.
Rostourism supports the law to abolish free luggage for non-refundable airline tickets
President Oleg Safonov stated in an interview with RBC that “positively” applied to the enactment of the law on the abolition of free carriage of baggage on non-refundable air tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the person who owns the luggage”, he stressed (the TS quote).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that despite citizens ' concerns, there would be no need to pay for the carriage of upper clothes and mobile phones in the handbag.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and to say that it is up to the upper clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad or even to some computer that has no relationship," said the head of Rosturism.
In the past, President Vladimir Putin of Russia has signed a law stipulating the right of airlines to exclude the provision for free carriage of luggage on non-refundable aircraft.
The point is that airlines can determine for themselves the number of seats and weights of baggage included in a non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin has ordered that the pollution of Baikal be eliminated
President Vladimir Putin of Russia, at the meeting on protection of Baykal, reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He mandated the identification of sources of financing, plans and performers for the eradication of pollution.
Mr. Putin also commissioned the full rehabilitation of contaminated territories.
“We also need to address the facilities that continue to work here, the clean-up structures of most of them are worn out”, quote the President’s RIA Novosti.
He also added that the Office of the Procurator-General of Russia should carry out an audit to identify environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area related to the occurrence of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by the organizers of rest.
"I want to emphasize this: not all are checked in a row; the measure also needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and measures to be taken," he stressed.
The Office of the Attorney-General had previously reported a decrease in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of environmental surveillance facilities.
Recall, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin stated on the straight line that it was necessary to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special protection regime.
He was informed by residents of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal natural territory, about his business problems.
Head Sergei Donskoh immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baykal water zone, but in the Government of Burundi it was recalled that such a change was not enough because the restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, the Miniconomies proposed to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Law on Environmental Protection.
A new temple will appear in the South
In the village of Sosiv, members of the community from the indigenous minority peoples of the North Rakhtinya, together with residents of the Berezov district, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honour of the clergyman Nikolay Miraclemaker.
Its location is the riverbank, the temple will be well seen from a distance, so it will serve as a lighthouse for fishermen.
According to representatives of the community, construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now established, and church bell towers are available.
The U.S. Navy has been escorted.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonder, because it is considered an Orthodox church as a patron of the moons, including fishermen.
In the Thamud, fishing gives the settlers work and feeds them.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children are even writing about it in school records as a local sight.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why does Singapore observe laws?
I'm talking to local businessman Jang, sitting in a diner in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, he carefully stores the cucumbers in an iron box with him from his office.
After the discussion, the businessmen go to the nearest urne — up to 100 feet [100 m] — and drop bulls out.
The garbage injection in the community -- $500 local, Jang reports.
You know, since I was a kid, it's just a reflex: you can't just drop a fan from the confetti to the bridge, and they're just instantaneous.
And now there's video cameras everywhere.
Indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the center of the city are clean, as in the museum.
Jang relates: Three months ago, his 18-year-old neighbor's son painted a graffiti wall on an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to vice.
What?
Imagine that.
He got ten shots of a wooden stick of strawberries and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, the AIF has been examined on the ground.
No one here is planning to rescind the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
The Government has long held the view of both the European Union and the United States in this regard.
If a man drives a lot of drugs or sells them, he's put in an emissary.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
It was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
But the guy was eventually hanged anyway.
After that, our country's drug-suckers make a careful run around the side.
The point is that Singapore is under the obligation of law to comply with the World Summit, not just with the modest and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are as a millionaire, as a vice-premier, as a well-known artist or as a resident of the European Union.
Option one in this case: If you get a drop of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you go to Singapore and meet a warning dog everywhere, it's a surprise to see how many prohibitions are in this city-state!
For example, the chewing rubber is sold only in pharmacies, and it can be purchased strictly by a doctor.
The tourist won't take the gum on the way in, but it's worth putting a cut in the subway, putting a fine of $1,000 on the locals.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on my neck, "I did."
In addition to a fine, the eyepieces are often sentenced to “silence in the yard” for a week to clean up the parks and beaches.
6,000 rubs pay a "criminal" who forgets to wash water in the public toilet, and when he tries to make a small need in the elevator of a house, he works a special detector - locks doors and sends a signal to the police.
Among the very exotic laws are prohibitions on feeding pigeons in the street, public performance of songs, and even excessive floods of the room plant.
In order to avoid fires, smokers can't be lit in the subway, otherwise they're fine with 5,000 Singapore bucks.
In general, there's a thought: if you don't try, you'll break something.
It's not like that - he's trying to dissuade me from Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local traveller.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years, I haven't seen anyone be drawn for their violation.
Why do they stay?
So that citizens don't relax.
The implementation of the basic rules is closely monitored.
Let's say if a minor is sold in a kiosk of cigarettes, they'll be punished all over the chain: the shopkeeper will pay a huge amount, the offender will be struck with sticks on the back, and the seller will also burn and put in jail.
It was because of such harsh laws that the crime in Singapore was very rare.
Is this justified?
As early as the 1970 ’ s, we had a chaos on motorized roads, ignoring lights, driving as we wanted, getting drunk for driving.
After the fines were imposed for a year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a portion of the whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police will not let go for the bribe, impose a fine of the cost of the apartment, and will be sent to prison for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia find the city to be a conclager.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson described Singapore as “Dislayland with the death penalty”, a guest from the United States of America as a horror of the wealth of the people, the “frightful clean airport” and the “cultural nature”.
To surf, such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and so should not in principle be.
The first days in Singapore and you're afraid to throw paper on the sidewalk, you get it when you walk in the subway with the ice cream.
But then you come to Small India, and suddenly you're going to break up the template: there's plastic cups at the bus stop.
"What's that?" You're surprised.
That's how the Singaporeans smile.
Everything happens.
Not every such "crime" will be caught in place, but you must know that if you are calculated, you will not retaliate, because you have broken the law.
Most of this is enough for a person to behave normally.
The authorities in Singapore, of course, are authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Viet Nam, I moved very cautiously — motorcyclists often get smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the centre of Paris, there's a lot of dirty bums and beggars.
In our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage into the urns.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on Earth through the recruitment of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
That's human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was sussing for driving until they started fines.
Although the main issue in Singapore is not fines, it is voluntary law enforcement.
And we have to think that in Russia, people would be happy with clean streets, no garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who smuggle the elevator with the public toilet.
Thank you, don't do that.
In the rest, Singapore law has as little as it can afford to look at it.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trump is targeting Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of a change of regime is when he starts to fight the statues.
Americans understand this as being no worse than everyone else -- hence deliberately theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Government of Trump, no doubt knew what he had done when he brought a symbolic toll on the Statue of Liberty during a heated dispute with journalist CNN Jim Acoston about the President's proposals for a sharp decline in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try on the statue itself.
He would have been lynched if he had tried to do so by the owners of pleasure boats and artists representing the Statue of Liberty.
But he bit at her meaning, especially the meaning she was assigned in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed when Emma Lazarus was added to the pedestal.
As Miller shouted at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines the world.
The creation you are talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller gave the facts correctly, but as he said, it's not really about history.
It is about the current sound of the shocking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, your crowds, who dream of breathing freely, and the unfortunate discards of your abundant shores."
Never before have the "unsuspective discards" been seen on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature, and he made it clear that they weren't waiting for the Trump in America.
This argument about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute over the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who struggled to put her words on the bed of the statue after her death, were very well aware that they were doing a completely political act.
The sculpture was meant to indicate the connection between the French Republic and the United States by means of a banal classical figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: the female figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she was given a completely different name: Mother of the Exorcists.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American Nazism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right one to change it back.
Rumorant Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist, who announced the arrival of Trump in 2010, thought that Liberty was not inviting anyone, rather she was an early neoconservator carrying the flame of America to the darkness of the world: “Freedom is coming forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
A torch is not needed to illuminate the way to the United States."
You know, against Limbo's routine, it's really gotten to the point.
The idea of a statue depends solely on the view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by the exhausted, unhappy, but full hopes of the people on the decks of ships after long and often heavy voyages.
This means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people seeking refuge and the prospect of a better life.
Its statues are in harmony with their words of hope and hospitality, which they desire to hear.
And, of course, it's not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torches are not meant to shed light on the way, but to fuel the hatred that is the only source of their power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake appreciates the Scottish members of the United Kingdom.
Eileyd Doyle recalls the time when only two Scots were in the United Kingdom.
Neil Blake, United Kingdom's light athletics director, said that a 16-person Scottish team at the World Cup would make “a significant contribution to the team play”.
The record number of Scottish aircraft was selected for the London Championship on Friday 2017.
Blake believes that in Scotland “something special is born” and the United Kingdom's light athletics should take this into account.
"We know that, and we're trying to understand and support while they have the potential," said Blake.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics believes that what they have done must be done.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: what they have done is to work.
And people on the street think the same.
I don't know why the circumstances have come to this, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scotsmen claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Buttert, which will compete with Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 metres and Eiled Doyle's team has chosen its captain.
"Elid's modest.
Her captain's speech was excellent," says Blake.
“Many of the athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have come out of this room with pride and a desire for victory.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilid put in her were remarkable.”
The silver medal holder of the Commonwealth Championship, who at his fifth World Cup will run 400 meters with obstacles, says that 16 Scotsmen in the British Assembly are "unbelievably".
The previous Scottish World Cup record was seven in 1983 and 2005.
In front of Laura Muir, a middle-distance runner, beating five British and two European record scores last year.
She'll run for 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who's going to be on the run at 1500 meters, is another Scotsman who's got to pay attention to: behind his back, he's got a good season in which he won the British Contests and the Annual Competitions.
Doyle recalls his first world championship when Lee McConnell was the only Scottish man on the team.
The captain of the team says she's "unbelievably proud" because so many of her compatriots have not only entered the assembly, but will in some cases claim medals and fight for finals.
"The team captain is chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and chose you - this is a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish people who went into the assembly room.
This shows how much we have done.
And they're all the lightweights that are going to try to get on the pedestal.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to be home for the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of what we're going to be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go to his arena and participate in the competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just great."
Banning critics on Facebook: you don't have to go to a public office unless you're willing to listen to voter criticism.
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, his criticism irritated him.
But he didn't stick his mouth to his critics.
Because, back in 1783, Washington said, "we can take away the freedom of speech, and we, both deaf and dumb, will lead as sheep to battle."
Now I'm going to move on to Governor Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and wiped out at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him.
The subordinate governors called this claim null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "no and what".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a Hogan guy.
He is a remarkably popular Republican governor in a democratic state for the benefit of the state.
He is second in the rating of the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has shown a firm hand in the management of the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as his primary way of communicating with his voters and showing his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, it is unnecessary and ultimately harmful to block those who come to the Governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and maintained by the administration for taxpayers' money.
In an interview with Washington Post, Secretary of State Amelia Ches defended the actions of the Governor, claiming that blocking comments was simply their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and heathens who are angry on the Internet.
The Post talked to some of the real people Hogan locked up.
And it's real people, not trolls, teachers, businessmen, pastor who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible as appealing to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramona of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I am disappointed by the lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news”, she wrote in the section of the comments to the article on the Post.
“I also do not like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say that it is a so-called sticker instead of recognizing that they are dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the governor's subordinates call "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call an active life position.
It is easy to edit your image in the Facebook age simply by blocking critics or by deleting negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical prejudices, or arresting and closing the mouth of protestors.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trampo was sued by Twitter users who were taken into his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Justice of Alexandria, James C. Kesheris, the chairman of the County Council of Appeal, Laudon, violated the First Amendment by putting the voter in his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevinu filed claims with the American Civil Liberties Union for his conduct on Facebook and Twitter.
It's not supposed to be that hard.
In Washington, D.C., the age of affordable postal costs has been almost as high as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the aliases of Jurikola, Valerius, Belisaius, and Porcius wrote letters in newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online project "George Washington's Documents", his cabinet was overrun by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, of opinion, and expression rests on the very basis of our State.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance Club
The former European champion Ronan Rafferty looks forward to home comforts for the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in East-Lotian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
The Northern Ireland breeder, who led the Archerfield Links Club next door, was moving towards the final round last year until he lost Paul Ilsa, attached to his new seat and played the role of the tournament representative on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
“I saw how the Renaissance club was built, and we watch him succeed with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it is in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job making this place happen.
He is very committed to this game and proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils looks forward to winning the championship for the first time, despite the fact that he won the European Challenge Tour for his 32-year career and the European Challenge Tour tournament.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said the player from Southport.
“I could not try to win the "Extremadura Open" again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I had won it.
It's magical to go back to this corner of the world.
It's a beautiful golf spot.
Last year's memories were coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression of winning last year.
It was indeed a special time, and we will always remember it.”
Returns to the battle on the home land of Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for older athletes following his 50th anniversary this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament in 2013.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little more important”, said the resident Helensboro Orr.
"You want to do the right thing, but you feel the extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a nice golf.
I am pleased with the way things are going so far.”
The former Masters winner is Ian Vosnem and the senior sportsman champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrans are two of the six Scottish men in the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmeyer and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs £5 per hour, if one person is in the car, and £10 if two or more are involved.
All income goes to the British prostate cancer fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
The tunnels above the highways capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars are already being tested on British roads.
The country's transport agency reported that Autocar had reported positive results from tests of a 100-metre tunnel installed on a highway in the north.
A tunnel 6 metres high is constructed of some of the latest polymeric materials that can absorb the harmful substances contained in the car exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the extensive measures the British authorities are about to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, English are going to expand the charging network for electric vehicles, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, expand the use of commercial transport by electric power and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, one quarter of all air pollution occurs in transport, and poor air quality is caused by up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorzud changed the sentence of a disabled mother to a fine.
Moshorsud changed the sentence of the disabled Anton Mamova, who was sentenced to a fine of 200,000 rubs for four and a half years.
This is reported by ATS.
The Prosecutor ' s Office had previously asked the court to replace the term on parole, explaining its request that Mamova ' s illness "impeded him to remain in prison".
Anton Mamoev, 28 years old, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, serving his sentence in a colony of general regime for the robbery suffered by a former Special Forces fighter.
On 19 July, the court released the man from custody at a visiting meeting in SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesian “golden land”
Bardina deguei doesn't use a stove.
She doesn't use it very well.
In his village home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County, in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua New Guinea, the householder usually simply places sweet potatoes, which are called “notes”, right in the eye.
Half an hour later, the charred tuber is delivered and eaten with impatience, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the ground floor — the furniture is missing — and this is where she does her work on the house, such as washing her clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in the room without roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
The polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many of the men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk in the village after five o’clock,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the former Dutch colony of Papua New Guinea, which joined Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote publicly in front of occupying forces.
The existing movement in favour of independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which has maintained strong control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road includes a half-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administration center, Nabira, and then a five-hour car crash.
There's no public transportation here.
The town with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of the corrugated steel are decorated with rust in various redish shades.
Few Indonesians came here, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the papayas had the pago worshiped a god named Hugo Tamey.
There have been other developments.
“We were not used to wearing these clothes,” says Degey, showing on his bright, woven hand turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"We used to wear leaves only on the body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives below the poverty line, and levels of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian golden land.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, located in Phoenix, Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles [60 km] from Paniya, a high-rise province about New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport obtained some $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast of reserves of forests valued at $78 billion.
These riches, however, result in one disaster for the papayas, guaranteeing that the powerful Indonesian armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid almost $20 million to local military personnel and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the papayas threaten the existence of this golden dwelling and are relentlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969 more than 500,000 papayas have been killed by the Indonesian military forces and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, massacres in indigenous peoples of the Papua Heights during the seventieth years could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, a report published in 2016 by the Brisben Eparchy contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture, particularly in parts, as claimed in another report, rape and electrocution, and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims, because incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harsono, researching Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Haitians had lingered because Papuan resources had attracted the influx of settlers from other areas of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83 per cent Christian, but the demographics change as Muslim economic migrants from the densely populated Indonesian islands, Yawa, Sumatra and Sulaves arrive.
Javan lavenders, varungi, sell roast chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to stand up to the competition.
“The migrants began selling chicken and vegetables cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abette Yow, a 20-year-old female in Paniyai, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial administrative centre, because of work.
“As a result, the indigenous inhabitants of Papua, the mother-mother (women) of Papua, have lost their market.”
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to deal with inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter secured the support of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniyai.
But Papua has not changed much, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for the Joks, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice,” You said.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration of Jokov Paniyai survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and sang Christmas hymns at a bar in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers were pulled out of the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javed Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk followed their children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government election commission building, and the next day, the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them the ritual hunting bows and filled the gate, and the dance of the Pappua tribe was the pago, running about in circles and depicting the singing of birds.
Some protestors started throwing stones at the police and military base.
When the situation got hot, internal radio soldiers were ordered: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them”, so it sounded as was claimed in the official document that the correspondents of the magazine Time saw, but which was not published in the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, head of the Koto district in Enarotali, was 50 years old, and he called for calmness when he asked the crowds to separate from their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, I suddenly fell a bullet in my left wrist,” he told Time, standing on the wing of his brightly decorated wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot, but she says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he added.
The local resident of Alfius Joavi has been shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran into him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johanes, who, like many Indonesians, had been using only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
General Jotje Mande, Senior Police Inspector of Papua, told reporters that his officers were merely “protecting” their base because she was attacked.
“We must protect ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Commissioner Pujo Sulistio of Papua Police in 2015.
This is the question of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news of the murders came only to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokovy delivered a speech in Jaipur expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation settled immediately so that it will never be repeated again in the future”, he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Viranto, said he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But you're about to make excuses.
“Most of the violations have been committed for a long time.
Some of them occurred in the nineties or at the beginning of the zeros.
The point is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed," he said.
Viranto then gave up his words, speaking to Time on 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It will be decided by judgment."
Viranto, accused of “crimes against humanity” by the United Nations of killing more than 1,000 people during a bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including an incident in Panama.
The families of the victims of Paniai encountered such allegations with dark mistrust.
“I have been questioned four times over the past three years, but there has been absolutely no change,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m afraid”, he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobus also felt that the people of Panama were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he said.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at village residents in the deiya district neighbouring Pania.
During the clash between the village dwellers and the construction company manager, who refused to help take the man unconscious to the hospital, one person died and another 17 were injured, including children.
The man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dow, drowned while fishing in a leaked river, died on the way to the hospital.
Infuriated villagers protested in front of a construction site owned by the company.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) started firing at a crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retribution,” reported Time of the 20-year-old Dominggu Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed.
"I've been hiding at my house for two days."
The Daily Parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident call for a response and that the mobile police brigade withdraw from the region.
Paniya has always been a painful place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development has caused discontent among the Mei, Moni, Dani and Dami, scattered throughout the territory covered by green central highland areas of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua (OPM) Movement, an insurgent army that claims to protect the rights of papayas by organizing sporadic attacks and raids with kidnappings on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniya, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and detained without grounds by the military on the pretext of “protection of national independence”.
Some never returned.
Among the population of Papua Paniai, it is considered a “safe, forgotten place”.
Poverty exacerbates discontent.
A small portion of the rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
The same degree of bread is not available.
People here produce everything they eat: mostly notes, as well as some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten of the notes are just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Economic disparities between indigenous Papua and new migrants have increased over time, which have arrived in large quantities since the introduction of new flights at Nabire Airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and well-formed migrants.
The papayas rarely have the money or skills needed to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village... because there is no job or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniya tribal council.
Insulation keeps Papua away from the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of the international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Eskiudi and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inadequate coordination with the relevant organizations” despite having been granted rare permission to conduct video production.
According to Felim China, Deputy Director of Asia, Human Rights Watch, promises made during the Jokov election campaign have not been met to remove media restrictions to promote transparency and development.
“At present, foreign journalists seeking to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new risks: visa waivers and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly limited by the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including shooting at Pania.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
A representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Aramanata Nasir, withdrew from the statement by the group, telling journalists in Jakarta that “In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign Governments to draw attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands led by the Netherlands Human Rights Ambassador Keis Van Baar visited Jayapur on 4 May, locals violated their silence, please: “We want freedom” as the source, who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
There will be new presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the papayas say it is unlikely that they will vote for the Jokovs again.
“Jacovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in shooting in Pania”, says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threats of the greedy army, are impoverished in poverty, and their education and health are in poor condition.
Gobai says that the people of Paniya, like the other papayas, consider their voice given to Joks, a debt that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shootings in Paniya carried out the latest symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on the ground directly opposite the police and the military station.
Knowing that justice may never be a thing, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“Killed a family member”, says Jacobus, without raising his head.
"What else did we do?"
The second time fire covers the Dubai skyscraper “Fackel”
The fire covered one of the world's highest living skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the seventy-decade structure at 337 metres high.
It's already the second fire that's been going through a tall building, which is a coincidence called "Fackel" in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up with fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down the 50th floor," Raiter told a skyscraper named George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, fire teams extinguished fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide shelter to the victims.
The incident could bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in the exteriors of high buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the Fakela administration after the fire, it was found there in 2015 that the poster was the most affected, the external panels used for layout and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and plaque panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the fire there in June, which killed some 80 people.
The rise in tourist traffic in Ida-Viruma in June was minimal
According to data from the Russian.err.ee portal in the Department of Statistics, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists were used in June 2017, an increase of 125 per cent or 0.6 per cent over the same period of the year.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has declined and foreign tourists have increased.
For example, foreign tourism increased by 7.3 per cent (544 persons) to 7994 tourists in June.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region has increased by 8.9 per cent or 318 in comparison with June 2016.
In June 2017, 3885 guests from the RF stayed at Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrew Malachi made it clear to worshipers who were responsible for his departure
Andrey Malachi hinted at his worshippers in Instagram, who were responsible for his departure from the First Channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today he has posted a fragment of the newspaper News of August 1.
The photo of Malachi signed the "boss molassus" tag.
An article on how to prevent “burning” of a worker and to draw attention to his condition.
If we recall numerous reports that the lead could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who was engaged in redesigning the "Let's talk", it becomes clear what he suggested so transparently, the KP writes.
It was reported that Andrey Malachi was currently on leave and that he had not signed an application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
Five military deaths in Afghanistan in the event of a car explosion
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, reports RIA Novosti.
According to the police, a mined car blew up near the military block at the Girisk Station the night before.
It's known about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new MP took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver took a video of his shark's bite-out camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) sealed on a video shark that bitten his ex-cam GoPro.
Rolik posted a US Marine Fisheries Agency unit on Facebook in Massachusetts, a staff member of Scomal.
The incident took place on 2 August on the coast of Cape Cod, north-east of the United States, explains the Necn portal.
The man tried to remove the shark from the chamber he was holding on a special stick during his submarine voyage.
Noting the man, the animal swam to him over three meters long.
The shark had to bite the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator had done so to determine whether he was having a boyfriend.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also noted that this behaviour of a sea animal had proved to be a novelty for scientists.
The reason for the mass fighting in the Ural military centre became known.
A working group of senior Central Military District officers came to the Elan Training Centre, where a massive fight occurred.
Some details of this fear have already become known.
According to Mash, who appeared on the VKontakte page, the contractors of the Ural Military Part No. 31612 were bitterly beaten because of the unreturned bed.
The beginning was that a privateman named Sayan had demonstrated his disregard for an officer's order to refuel the tarpaulin.
An officer from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men were demolished in the barracks by beds and sinks, beaten by glass.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fighting.
At CSC, they denied the information on the tenderness.
The study showed that at least one fifth of the passengers in the United States carried prohibited items into an aircraft.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of passengers were deliberately or accidentally carried on board the aircraft through inspection points of the United States Department of Transport Safety, including a minimum of 6 per cent were on board, without supervision of prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and involving over 1,000 people, also revealed that young passengers were more inclined to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly something prohibited by APB, 19.7 per cent had been millennia compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of Generation X.
APB staff are most likely to carry food and water by consciously passing away.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had specifically carried sharp objects through the inspection, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had accidentally smuggled through airport inspections and how many had done so knowingly.
It is expected that most often, consciously or unconsciously, smugglers through surveillance of those who fly the most.
According to the company, the APB rules are rather complicated and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and in what quantities.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what the APB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the APB might be banned from carrying a book.
Liquids are allowed on internal flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Pruitt refuses to postpone implementation of both emission reduction rules
The day after the request of the 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded his decision to postpone implementation of the Obama regulations aimed at reducing the emissions of air-pollutant substances and enabling education.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency was now more responsive than it had been to previous administrations to the needs of environmental authorities in individual states.
He did not mention a lawsuit against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute took place around the 1 October deadline for States to comply with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that they would be postponed for one year to give their department more time to study the plan and to avoid “conformity with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who had been known long before President Tramp was appointed to his current post as Attorney General of the state of Oklahoma, was known as a consistent opponent of the tightening of environmental standards.
Following his transfer to Washington, D.C., Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of rules against the chemical or gas oil industry.
The sudden change of course on Wednesday is the regular legal defeat of the course taken by Puitt in return to past norms.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his authority in trying to postpone the Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that he simply fulfilled the obligation of EPA to cooperate with the States in an integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“In previous EPA administrations, it was often impossible to settle within the time frame, then awaited lawsuits from groups of activists and others and discussed the time frame for the settlement of the case”, said Pruitt, who had filed more than a dozen lawsuits against EPAs in his previous post.
"We do not believe in the regulation through trials, and we are serious about the time frame.
We are also serious about our constitution and the power it gives us.”
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point re-use its “delegation powers and other powers of law” to ensure that the rules “jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information”.
Republicans in Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
The Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that had filed a lawsuit against EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue its legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA course - after our actions - is an important victory in the fight for health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who have been directly influenced by their cities," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Columbia.
Earth-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in response to sunlight.
This can cause serious breathing problems for those who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in the Pruitt course.
“It is a great thing to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from a person who is responsible for protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Baird of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Lightweight Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Recovery Council of WFLA, which issued a report Monday, recommending that the suspension be suspended.
166 votes against 21 in favour of the suspension.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that WFLA had made significant progress in meeting the conditions set by the Re-entry Council but that these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Because of the disqualification of WFL at the London World Cup, Russian aircraft were forced to act under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 persons admitted to IAAF.
WFLA was subjected to indefinite disqualification by IAAF in 2015.
A report by the independent expert of the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was then published, which referred to numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For more details on the latest report of the IAAF Board, please read in "U" "IAAF has extended the sanctions against BFL".
Conjugation
In the framework of the 3rd Tour of the Russian Fontbeth Championship, New Moscow's Chemical conducted a retreat match against the Khaluga FK.
Over 10 days ago, rivals played each other in Russia's cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
Chemical did not give up on the opponent, but the second-round relaxation at the end of the match led to an insulting goal and fiasco.
Following the recent defeat of the Cauliflowers at a count of 0:3, many had previously prophesied a slight victory for the masters.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the new Moscows were forced to be considered and acted against the defence but from the position of force.
In 1 time, the puddles were built and had the advantage of possessing the ball.
Another very good-quality match was by Alexey Sirotin, who repeatedly reflected dangerous blows and gave partners confidence.
Unfortunately, the Chimiko attack lacked effort and luck to put the Coluga defense on the stand and kill the first goal on the exit.
After the interruption, the game began to run on the next course.
The Nemoscows have been more active in the attack.
The alarm calls for our team have been made by mistakes in defense, which have allowed the Muads to create a number of acute moments.
Within 10 minutes of the meeting, Chemical seized the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the coven's experience played a role -- they held the end of the gate more literately and cold-bloodedly, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, Chemick transferred the ball to the corner, whose handing over the fields unrelentingly moved to the gate.
Yury Dubrovine became the author of the goal.
In the reporting meeting, Chemical demonstrated a good game, but he suffered an insulting defeat.
In front of our team is another exit - on August 11th at 19th in Moscow, at the Torpedo Stadium of Edward Streltz's Newmoscows will meet the favourite group "Centre" of the FC Ararat, composed of Roman Pavlučenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come back and support the Chemical!

According to the telephone conversations published by the public, Trump was pressuring Mexico about the wall payment on the border
The Washington Post has published telephone decryptions between President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a phone call with President Enrique Penhey Nyetaj Trump of Mexico, he insisted that he stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The president of the United States was blaming him for publicly speaking against the wall, and according to the leaked information, he said to him, “You can’t say this to the press”.
Trump began his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
In his first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, published by the decryption, there was also a heated conversation.
Trump told Ternbull that the agreement that the United States should accept refugees sent to Australia, “stupid”, “disgusting” and “tupo” and insisted that, because of an agreement concluded by Obama’s administration, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop the refugee movement to the United States.
Trump finished the conversation, said to Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation in the whole day”.
The bodies of those killed in Abkhazia were taken by tourists from Sochi to St. Petersburg by plane.
A plane belonging to the Russian airline, on board of the bodies of the Russians killed in Abkhazia, left at 8:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, passing the TASS.
At the site of the final checkpoint, members of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's mayor, were told by journalists by Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba, Deputy Minister of Resorts and Tourism.
Previously, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that all the costs of transporting the bodies back to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to compensate the families of the deceased in the amount of 500,000 rubles.
According to Ahab, the Abkhaz leadership expressed a willingness to pay for the families of the deceased by the bombings of the tourists to fly and live in the Republic, but the relatives only sent the Republic the authority to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, at approximately 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions were launched in the village of Primorsky Gudout district in the warehouse of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic's missile and artillery, followed by the detonation of large-calibre shells and other munitions.
As a result, storage facilities had been set on fire, causing uncontrolled shell explosions of various modifications.
As a result, two citizens of Russia, Elena Poljakova, born in 1970, and Elena Timofiev, born in 1962, were killed while resting near a cheese-bearing source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were brought to the medical facilities of the Republic with injuries of various degrees of severity.
There are currently seven people left at the station, the others listed.
Studying Russian influence on the American elections will take on a large jury
Russian Special Prosecutor Robert Muller convened a large jury in Washington to study the influence of Russia on the U.S. presidential elections in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The material collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient for the prosecution.
The grand jury has given Muller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of these investigations into the jury, which began a few weeks ago, would be the details of the meeting of the son then another candidate for President Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalya Veselnitska.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Muller himself had earlier promised.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, Donald Trump, Jr., was reported to have expanded the state of lawyers.
The Trump Junior had previously told us that he had been waiting for a compromise at the headquarters of a candidate from the Department of Hillary Clinton, but no disclosure documents had been submitted, but the adoption was the case.
In early August, a number of media reported that Trampa Jr.'s application for a meeting with Veselnitska had been literally dictated to the elderly.
In the White House, it was clarified that the President was not dictated, but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Deputy Mayors of Penz were detained in the workplace.
The Deputy Chief of Administration of Penza Irina Shirsin was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, RIA Novosti reported.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this matter have not yet been received, but the S.S.S. Press Service has assured them that they will be under way soon.
There is no comment on what has happened at the Penz's mayor's office.
Irina Shirsin is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been involved in urban affairs and land relations since April 2015.
She had worked for a long time as head of the Department of Public Health in the Penzen Region.
Irina Shirsin is raising three minor children, noting that she again became a mother a year ago, abandoned her maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there's no cosmodrome in Mexico, no carrier rockets.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the setup of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first man in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet era, which are worn down in some countries, Gagarin's monuments are “scattered on the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was set up near the former NASA headquarters in American Houston.
In London, a memorial was placed on the territory of the Royal Observatory in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The memorial in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped the demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was transferred from the city centre to the area in front of the local airport.
During the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, a monument to Yurius Gagarinsu appeared in Riga.
That's what the name of the first cosmonaut sounds like in Latvian, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: activists will lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
"Ford Mercury" in 1948 passed by the audience in the village of Monroe in Georgia and ran with a roar toward the small Morse Ford bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver drove up to the bridge, a group of white men and rifles blocked her path.
The man in the middle of his life, in a suit in a thin strip, stuck in a cigar and looked through the windscreen.
Sitting inside scared.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" cried a man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The soaring bursts broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on 22 July, is just a stage.
But when Roger's neck was filled with a loop, almost all the viewers and actually held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again the night that in 1946 the Kukluxklans lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
“It’s amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years, although we see them next to us; although we know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the show.
"It's the stain on our history and it's the stone on our souls."
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress, who has been fighting for human rights for the rest of his life.
To him, the performance was a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice had never been corrected.
"We want to investigate, we want to complete, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but first we have to achieve justice," he said.
"We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until justice is reached."
The coroner's body covers one of the lynching victims at the Morse Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI reports received by En-Bi-Si News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of participating in lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that in the city two connected motives — politics and sex — have always been well - known.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens to vote in favour of the summer.
About the same election, according to FBI reports, Black Lieutenant Roger Malcolm struck in a fight with the knife of Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that according to rumors in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy’s wife, and that the child she was supposed to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and drove to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of lynching men surrounded the car.
“It is clear that the organization and commander of the Harrison murders were organized and commanded”, which is found in one of the FBI reports.
"It is also clear that there has been a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies who not only participated in the killings but also destroyed evidence and hid the witnesses' identities."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an election attempt," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in the city: if you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been leading an annual performance that reproduces the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Its spectacle is watched, it captures the viewer and tells of deep racism, which many would like to see is no longer in America.
It's hard to look at, and it's even harder to turn around, but Greene thinks that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's trials because they show us our own uglyness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals of this year began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors -- a dozen whites, the remaining blacks -- gathered in the room and listened to the screening of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He's played the lead clan for several years, but he says it's never gotten easier.
"I feel like I'm out of my mind because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at the time."
The actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Raskon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal starts with Malcolm sleeping with his wife, Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Yelling Racon in reply.
It's giving away a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are inflamed with a holocaust.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
"What's that?" Ask Ascon.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I losing?
"No," says Green through the laughter.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'nigga'."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You must excite a solid r."
Also, energy changes in the room: discomfort changes in a feeling of companionship.
Everyone has to do everything right, not just for the play, but for the memory of four people killed.
The stage begins first.
This time, when Rascono says the word "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
Spectacular ends fiercely and quickly.
Shouts, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands above the bodies of the actors and performs a sad song by Billy Holliday "Strenge Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, half a hundred spectators wipe tears and sweat from her eyes.
Among the viewers, there are almost equal numbers of black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the performance; many live near them.
They've been putting up with Georgia for almost eight hours as Brooks led them into pilgrimages to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the killings were history, but now that they're standing in the same place where people were lynching, their ghosts seem to be in the air.
When the last note of the song closes, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
The children lean on their heads, touch the paint that shows blood, and the still bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy buries to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it's over.
Actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main puppetclan.
Nick Rascono embraces two other actors and suddenly cries, falling into their arms: the emotional strain of the show finally hit him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had your reasons for this."
Later, the audience will have dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are busy discussing a performance with a black couple whom they have just met.
Dennis Daplinsky finds words hard to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynching is still happening," she adds, "only now it's called shooting the police."
In another corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, a human rights worker, took a general interest in his work.
He said that he had already started planning a presentation next year.
"We are encouraged by the design because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.”
Court fined Navalny for violations on the "Agitation Saturday"
Moscow's Simonov Court fined Alexei Navalny for 300,000 roubles for violating the order of the organization of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence provided for by Article 8 20.2 of the Co-AP RF “Repetition of the order of the organization of the rally”.
Earlier, Judge Hizir Mussaev of Moscow Court of Simonov finished the administrative proceedings against Leonid Volkov, head of opposition chief Alexei Navalny, who was held accountable under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In that amount, Judge Mussaev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the “Agligation Saturday” which the supporters of Navali held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Having seen the agitators watching the participants on the Saturday, the police found that the organizers of the event had deliberately hidden its true substance, a public action (for which permission from the capital authorities must be sought in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Ždanov and Alexander Pomažuyev applied for termination of administrative proceedings for the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made some mistakes in the preparation of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained on the very “agitation Saturday”, but he received an agenda requiring him to appear at the police station to tell about an event in his active participation.
The same agendas were received by Naval and another counterpart of the opposition, Nikolai Laskin.
Arrested in Mordovia by a shooting bride and three wedding guests
The court in Mordov arrested a local man who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the Republic ' s Office of the Investigation Committee.
The incident took place in the evening of 29 July.
During the 42-year-old dispute, Saranska, a number of times, fired at the guests the events that had come to the countryside to bathe.
Three women and one men were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code, article 30, part 3, and article 105, paragraphs (a), (e), and article 105, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code (“Failure to kill two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner on the basis of hooliganism”).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the wedding guests decided to bathe in the territory of his waterfront site.
Minergo tightens the requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power stations.
At the start of the gas turbines, the GES turbines, oil pipelines and oil production, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with Minenergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government decree is now ready and available for public discussion.
The new requirements will only touch upon “critical energy equipment” delivered to Russia.
Potential threats are identified in the document, such as information and access to foreign intelligence, criminal elements and structures, hostile partners and hackers.
The EU has expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
On 4 August, the Press Service of the European Union stated that anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded due to a dispute over the supply of Simens to Crimea turbines.
This was previously reported on by the Week's Arguments.
The press service of the EU Council stated that sanctions against the Russian Federation had been expanded due to a dispute with Simens turbines that had allegedly been smuggled into Crimea.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to extend anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and the decision was made, the sanctions against Russia had been expanded.
Pierson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British Education Group, Pierson, announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 per cent as a result of the launching of a regular restructuring programme aimed at addressing the problems facing their business.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon, will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, occur in addition to the 4,000 jobs reduced in the previous restructuring.
Pierson announced that it planned to reduce the cost by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May during the third cost-reduction programme to try to bring back to life a business that had been hit by a rapid shift in digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman concert, said that its projections for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 per cent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to £2.5 billion.
Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in the death toll
According to information from official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, as NATO reported.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the city area of Karabakh.
This explosion was the last of the massacres that struck Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday as a result of a Mosque explosion in Guerata.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO reported that the explosion that occurred in the evening of Thursday occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by “a man carrying an improvised explosive device”.
All wounded are reported to be in stable condition and receiving treatment at the United States military hospital at the Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to UN reports, there were at least 1662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 and about 20 per cent in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bombing on a car resulted in the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area in Kabul.
The Taliban stated that they had attacked.
On 31 May, a massive explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people — the most serious human casualties of the attack in the country since the United States-led troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States assesses the need to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its lines of conduct, and particularly the reputation of President Ashraf Ghana.
The Environmental Protection Agency, following judicial actions, annuls the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has cancelled the decision to postpone the Obama Act that states should limit air-pollutant emissions a day after 15 states have sued the agency because of this step.
On the evening of Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called 2015 ozone measurements, stressing that this step demonstrates the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and response to our partners in the states,” said Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country in order to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter standards of air purity for one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the federal district of Colombia, filed a claim claiming that this was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to push back a wide range of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed at a brilliant economic growth, according to Trump.
However, actions in this direction have led to resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible health impact of large emissions.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website says that the use of ozone-containing air breathing “may impair the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
European Business Association v. new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the US economic sanctions against the RF.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, and therefore it should not be limited to the principles of free trade.
The European business is bringing together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow business to be separated from politics and to find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to limit traffic on the Pskow coastline
The Pskow People ' s Voters sent a letter to the head of the UMVA on the town of Sergei Surin on the problem of movement along the Great Coastal River.
Mayors Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of the Party and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this area.
In their view, the control of drivers would help to make the territory safer and more secure.
The problem is that the violators ignore the signs of "Travelway" and travel freely on the coast.
Major repairs and repairs are reported to have failed.
Sports and children's playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, the central seaside patrol officers patrol the PPS and the wives at night.
As a result, the number of vehicles that pass is reduced, but the traffic continues to continue.
Putin demanded that the investigative authorities not remove hard drives
President Vladimir Putin of Russia has proposed that investigative authorities be prohibited from removing servers and hard drives from working computers in enterprises.
The Head of State made this statement at the meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary “to exclude the application for investigation of measures leading to the suspension of business activities, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if the investigators had to do so, “copy them, assure them and use them in the course of the investigation”.
The Head of State added that it was not possible to “create conditions preventing the enterprise from continuing its activities until taxes could be paid”.

Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltnam.
In 1959, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olive at the Tragedy of Coriola.
Hardy also remembered the repeated performance of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agata Christie's shows on Miss Marple.

Something was missing in the Danish State: Prince Henryk, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Labrad, refused to be buried with his venereal wife, Queen Margret.
This year, the four have a golden wedding, but the couple's agenda is not preparation for celebrations, it's an affluent argument.
His Highness refused the title of Prince Consortium, and he conspired with the Queen that she never wished him the title of the Consent King.
Henryk lives in France, although he remains the official wife of the queen.
Russia's IID urges Washington to stop scheming Moscow
IN THE Ministry of the Interior, Russia responded to the comments made by Mike Penz, who accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated some time ago by the foreign policy agency.
In its commentary, the Ministry indicated that the United States was increasingly using cold war stamps, inadequate modern realities.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to stop scheming the Russian Federation.
According to the week's papers, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vassili Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive individual.
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily to hold the most exciting boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN office premises in Los Angeles, until Garcia, an undefeated champion in the light weight of the World Boxing Council, passed through the corridor to greet Lomachenko, champion of the World Boxing Organization in the second half weight.
After a unanimous victory by Garcia over the world's former champion in four weight categories by Erin Broner on Saturday, on Showtime, both boxers are in the five best boxers regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in conjunction with Miguel Marriago on Saturday at 7 pm on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posed for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive battle between them would be the most.
"I used to be in a semi-sleep weight," said Garcia.
"I'm going up to the category for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm short for 140.
I want to go down to the helm.
And he needs to climb up to a pound [up to 135 pounds], and then we can do it together.
That's what fans want.
Let's set it up for them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxu needs this unit."
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy he adhered to for Lomachenko to carry out his debut fight in the weight of 135 later this year to appoint the next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-30 knockouts), who also wanted to meet the winner of the link between Jorge Linarez and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the world champion in the light weight on the 23 September arena “Forum”.
“The fight could be on the PPV because all the refugees asked for it”, said Garcia, expressing a willingness later to collide on the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will arouse such interest.
As soon as they are ready ...'
Garcia said she considered Lomachenko a "surprising boxer" and might visit his Saturday unit.
But Lomachenko did not immediately give García his compliments and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three weights from Riverside looked “very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout”.
Garcia said he was focused on showing the force of the blow, and then the boxing.
They both said that they felt the tension growing before their own individuals.
"This fight must take place.
There's not so much interest and conversation in any other fight.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for one of those topless boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
This will be a great fight.”
On several central streets, Moscow will cut traffic on weekends
On this weekend, 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted in the capital on the Tverská Street section from the Nastasin Strait to the Triumph Square, as well as the movement on the 1st Tverska-Yam Street.
In addition, travel will be closed on Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tverska-Yam Street.
There will be an overlap on all sites on both sides, reports the Information Centre of the Moscow Transport Department.
Streets will be closed from midnight to 5 a.m. on 7 August due to their upgrading.
Also on weekends, traffic will be shut down on the Moscow coast.
The construction of the Charge Park is continuing there.
Putin ordered the Attorney General to check on Baykal.
President Vladimir Putin instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to inspect Baykal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“Please contact the Office of the Attorney-General to verify the Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, said Vladimir Putin at a meeting on environmental development issues in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader has asked for action if the facts of the violations are identified.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new medical assessment of age, show that more than 80 per cent of those protested have been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized for not being able to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 test cases, and the forensics agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were judged as 18 years of age or older, while 25 other cases were evaluated by the forensics agency as “probably 18 years of age or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “probably less than 18”.
Tests are conducted only in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Guernsson of the forensics agency, the results are consistent in the past months.
“We don’t see much difference in statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate”, he said to the portal “The Local”.
The high proportion of cases in which people were judged to be 18 years of age does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In my agency, the results of the 581 tests were published and reported that in 442 cases “presumably 18 years of age tested or older”.
However, after considering 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person publicly stated that he was 18 this year.
The method of medical evaluation of age, which was designed to make X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and tomography of knee joints and to give them to dentists and radiologists for analysis, has also led to criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Carolina Institute of Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of the people in order to determine whether they have been through sexual maturation sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think we should use the measurement methods that are being used now.
The biological age is thus highly inaccurate.
If we cannot determine it with certainty, we must not pretend to be able to do so," he said to the newspaper “Metro”.
Garenssen, of the forensics agency, however, expressed support for the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of misadventure of a child as an adult is small.
We face the greatest risk when a person is 18, in which case he is about 10 per cent.”
I'll think of running for president.
During a working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to consider whether he would be running for President of Russia in the 2018 elections, passing on Interfax.
This statement was in response to a request from the inhabitants of the village of Črmuzka Burata.
During a video conference on the elimination of the fire in Burundi and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirovic, we ask you, when the next presidential election will be, we ask you all to run again.”
"All right, I'll think about it, thank you," the president replied.
On 28 July, President Dmitry Peskov, Press Secretary of Russia, commented on the comments made by some media that Vladimir Putin's election headquarters would be headed by President Anton Wyno, Head of Administration of the Russian Federation.
The sands referred to these assumptions as “not based on any hypothetical reasoning”.
"until there are no headquarters, until headquarters is established far, until the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.
"until it's on the agenda," said Peskov.
Western Virginia Governor said he was going to another party.
The Governor of Western Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump, which is moving to another party.
“You like it or not, but the Democrats have alienated me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many meditations... today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of use to you as a Democrat Governor.”
The rally blew up in applause.
“Then tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republican,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play differently."
In the past, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won over 42 per cent in Western Virginia, and Justice did not support Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited a coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, on Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republic Party issued a statement that “The move of Governor Justice to another party is another blow on the Democratic Party, which is rather an obstacle than working to make our country great again”.
“With only 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s statement is just another rejection of a party that does not have leaders above the bottom and is unable to find a positive, uniting message”, said Ronn Macdeeniel, National Committee of the Republican Party’s CBS News, in a statement.
Mr. Krasavchik found a home thanks to the social media
Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Krasavczyk weighing more than 14 kilos after it became famous because of the Internet.
Mashable reports it.
At the end of June, a photo of a cat asked to find his master was published in a pet account on Facebook, because he was "obviously fed".
In comments, users noted that the expression of the animal’s face could become a new meme.
The publication has gained more than 32,000 swears and 15,000 comments.
In commentaries, dozens expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Krasavchik.
As a result, he was given to Angela Frazi (Angela Frazee), who promised to take on his weight.
In an interview with WNCN radio, the American reported that she had already had this experience: she took a cat weighs about 10 kilograms and now it weighs just over five pounds.
In July, Reddit drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
More than 68,000 views were collected with a picture of the animal.
The commentators noted that she could have made a career in a model business.
Cou praised Russia's “excusation” for the doping scandal
The International Light Athletics Specialist Sebastian Coe commended Thursday for his sincere apology from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the moment was not right to allow the country to participate in sports again.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics, Dmitry Putin, informed the International Association of Light-Federal Federations Congress, which had passed past the world championship on light athletics, that the removal of his country from sporting competition was fair and that he was determined to combat doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals at the competitions”.
In spite of his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Small Arms Federations voted in favour of the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of the use of doping financed by the State.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” said the President of the International Association of Light-Federal Federations of Coe to reporters.
“All the council and Congress liked it... that the Russian Federation itself recognized that there were extremely hot times and was now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the Federation.”
Koi said that he also “liked” that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I believe that it has been a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which it is not the time to restore Russia to rights now,” said Coe.
“In the next few months, we must do our utmost to address this situation.
Our main principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the wrong system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Trade Federations, will participate under the neutral flag in the light athletic championship of the world, which will begin Friday in London.
The head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Light-Federal Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements were still to be met for the reconstruction of Russia.
According to the London reporters, after a report made at the Council of the International Association of Light Trade Federations, drug testing is still not in sufficient volume, and suspended trainers are still doing their work calmly.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of hospitable
Journalist Vasily Muravicki, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), sent for two months under arrest, transmits SBU.
Journalal Gitomer's Internetman is suspected of treason by the State by posting his publications on Russian websites and in violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a “variable policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to have a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The Commander of Borsini patrol ship entered the territorial waters of Libya to stop the influx of illegal migrants along with the Navy of the country.
The decision to initiate the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome had agreed with an internationally recognized Libyan Government, which did not control much of its territory.
The opposing Cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And Commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to take action against Italian ships.
In Rome, on the other hand, they stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of Europe-recognized Libyan Cabinet Faiz Saradja.
The Italian authorities have launched a maritime mission to combat illegal migration following the publication in July of statistics on the number of illegals entering the country from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that the resources for receiving migrants had been exhausted.

Two leaders of Ukraine ' s collection in light athletics have been suspended from participation in the PMI
Olga Zellak and Olesa Povh, who specialize in running for short distances, are excluded from the collection of Ukraine at the World Cup 2017 in London.
This is reported on the Federation's Easy Athletics (FLAU) website.
Such a decision was taken by the organization in conjunction with the establishment of the International Association of Air-Athletal Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings in respect of aircraft.
Sergey Basenko, a trainer from the Ukrainian delegation, was also excluded.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects a doping athlete.
The bronze prize is the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Cup, the European 2010 Championship in the 4th 100-metre raffle, the 2012 European Championship winner in the 4th 400-metre Estaphet.
The London Light Athletics Championship will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How Football Financial Rules Affect Neumara’s Move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited losses from European football clubs do not prevent the world record of the transfer of Neymar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint-Jerman.
Whatever the consequences may have may be further along the chain, for Pari Saint-Jerman by WEFA, the governing body controlling the European football, whose authorities prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League Champions tournament.
From the financial rules of the Fair Play introduced by WEFA in 2011, it is clear that SWAps will eventually have to show that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelone paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to free Brazilians from the contract, and Naymar will receive a salary that reaches tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Naymar’s move to France.
The "PJ" can certainly be used to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars if you take into account the funding of the team by the rich energy of the ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as President of WEFA in 2007.
A former French football player believed that clubs in debt in their quest for success were, in fact, deceitful and risked destruction if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on debt clubs and instead became a tracking of their losses.
As a result of this change in business model, originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003, to buy a club with good potential and then to spend a lot of time in order to improve the team and create a world brand, has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year assessment period, which takes place in 2018, clubs may lose EUR 30 million.
And although Platoni was disgraced by the 2015 presidential office, his successor to UEFA Alexander Ceferin was still determined to contain excessive losses.
Of course, the FFP is alive, and we are moving forward to tightening the rules, said Andrea Traverso, an Associated Press agency in the UEFA, last week.
Although he will pay for the purchase of the Naimara contract at the same time, he may, for accounting purposes, distribute the amount for the entire contract.
Niemar signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as a cost of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the AFG, as well as Abu Dhabi Manchester City, were subjected to the most severe sanctions.
A penalty of €60 million (at $82 million) was imposed, which was later reduced to €20 million, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team at the League of Champions during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to outsmart her financial inspections by rubbing up her income for the company's owners.
Although a Qatari company could have been able to promote SWAP, if the amount of funding were to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014 when WEFA decided that the amount of funding from the Katara Tourism Office had been blown up.
It was reported that some of Naymar's earnings in the PSC could be made in the form of payments by the organizational committee of the peace champion 2022 in Qatar.
However, the UEFA and Qatar-2022 deny that Naymar will become an ambassador to the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be discovered by the UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on SWAps mean that UEFA would be even more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, persons familiar with the situation did not hold preliminary discussions with the UEFA on the transfer of Neymar.
They were in contact with the Associated Press on anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the provision.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, the Polish Civil Service received more than €10 million in turnover of €542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
The SCW expects Neumara's arrival to be a favourable ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and T-shirts with the logo of the team.
The club assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent as a result of the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly upset that one of the best football players was leaving, the Spanish League tried to prevent Neumara from transferring, claiming that the FGM would break the Fair Play financial.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping”, with the club and the State,” said President La Liga Javier Tebas, Spanish newspaper, with the view that Qatar is the ultimate owner of “Fundamental Doping”.
Arsenala coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about the financing of the club by the State.
“This is all the consequences of participation, and this has completely changed the football landscape in the last 15 years”, Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It has become very difficult to respect the financial fair, because there may be many ways and many reasons for being represented by such a serious player.
Order and venue of the oath will be decided by the President
Where and as new Russian citizens would swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President would define such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law by drafting the Gosduma Committee on Law and Government.
A week ago, the MPs planned to determine directly the order of the oaths in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as incapacitated children, from the amended text of the draft Law on Nationality of the Russian Federation (which will be before the Committee at its second meeting on 11 July).
President Vladimir Putin supported the introduction of an oath when he became a citizen of the Russian Federation instead of formally signing the documents on 6 June during a meeting with the Speaker of Gosduma Wiachslav Volodyni.
Deputies have formulated this idea as an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which calls for the abolition of the decision to extradite citizenship to those who have subsequently been convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (article 205.2 of the Criminal Code), and for the expulsion of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is linked to terrorism (article 4, paragraph 211 of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill was that, in formulating documents for citizenship, a person was signed under a promise to abide by Russian law - to take the path of extremism, he violated that promise.
The bill was introduced in April to the Gosdum by the leaders of the thought factions Vladimir Vasilev (the only Russian Federation), Gennady Züganov (CRC), Vladimir Girinowski (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (the “Principal Russia”) and Speaker, Mr. Vyacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the MPs accepted him on first reading.
Last week, the Government and Legislation Committee approved the text of the bill for a second reading, but it has now been redrafted.
It now states that the order in which the vows are made will be established by the President of the RF.
Parliamentarians had previously intended to describe the procedure directly in the Law on Nationality of the Russian Federation, pointing out that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting before the State hero and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place, a list of places where the RF was possible was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, heads of government, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, federal executive heads, etc.
Most likely, it could be the ZGAs.
A solemn oath will be made by officials wishing to obtain Russian citizenship once their documents have been verified by officials.
But the Russian passport will only be obtained after the oath has been delivered, from the text that has been finalized.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in by 18 years, not 14 years.
A rule has remained that vows will be released from incapacitated or limited capacity, as well as from those who cannot speak, read or sign the oath manually.
In addition, President RF has the right to exempt from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also stipulates a special procedure for the admission of Ukrainian citizens who are considered to bear Russian.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making a declaration to the authorized authority of Ukraine for this purpose.
A notarized copy of the statement will have to be sent to Russian officials.
A waiver of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be necessary if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first vice-spiker, Ivan Melnikov (CRC), Natalya Poklowska, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Irat Farrahov (all - "The One Russia").
I think many of you know that it's impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine.
Accordingly, very many people are waiting to decide their destiny with regard to the nationality of the RF, explained the previous head of the Thought Committee on Government and Legislation, Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the employment of certain posts for foreigners would not apply to those who had writtenly renounced “other” nationality and had issued an earlier passport to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but “for reasons beyond their control” he was no longer considered a national of another country.
Aliens are now prohibited from taking office in the municipal service, being employed at facilities and in organizations related to the security of Russia.
Nor can a person with dual nationality or residence permits from another country become a member of the Gossmeda Council or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on 1 September 2017 and that the necessary pieces of legislation should be prepared by that time.
Nostalgia is becoming niche in "The Light of the American Summer" and "The Shop Detective."
The current iteration of history is nostalgic about the glorious days of the characters in the 1980s; about the age of the 90s granary (sometimes when the eminent masters David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made a comedy of the State sketch for MTV); and about themselves -- that is, 2001 -- before her stars, Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauler and Paul Radd moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the promotion and realization of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But how franchiza she seems to be anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, not only because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the talking vegetable bank that H. John Benjamin had sounded).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached adulthood; this makes it impossible to go back to becoming part of the joke.
“Ten years later”, where adults have played before adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystemic and includes reefs from stalker films of the 1990s, such as the “Hands of a Cradle”.
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other things since 1991".
Many of the plotting moves are the same.
Charity Coop (Shoualter), now a writer, has yet to achieve a mutual relationship with Katy (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) was still virginity.
And there's also this crazy and mean conspiracy that Ronald Reagan (also known as Shawler) is involved in, which George Bush Senior is inciting (the tested parody of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is to derogate from it.
It's especially fun to see an eternal young Radd who sings Matt Dillon's song from "The Ones", whose character, Andy's ex-great man, looks old now.
This franchise could have been successful by random madness in the spirit of a recursive series "Seven Up" until it reached the conclusion that, I think, it would be a logical conclusion: "The Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last stage, the entire company would go to the movie premiere of "The Hot American Summer".
The Amazon detective factory refers to another type of nostalgia: the memory of the cold war of the Americans, the Explosive Blonde or even the Flash with its images of the East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gheitwood and Alessandro Tanaka, with director Riz Thomas, depicts the film: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s on two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and Marxist-Lenian pathway.
The main roles of Gregor and idealist Joseph are Florin Pierresik Jr. and Corneliu Ulic, and their dialogues were echoed in English by Chenning Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (police spends time watching chess games, how Americans could watch football).
The famous team behind the footage is Jenny Slatt, Nick Offerman, Mahershalah Ali, and Chloe Sevinyi, which makes it interesting to play " guess the voice".
But the detective shop has such a hold on the veracity of the unsuspecting propaganda drama -- there's even a keeler in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are long, and it's funny not often.
If it were to be made more quickly, the detective shop might be better able to deal with its satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, whenever Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby absorbing a lot of hamburgers.
To the imaginary Communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of any kind of glutton.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
Russia's SuperCube Football Fund between Spartacus and Locomotiv will be about 30 million rubs.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFFL) Sergey Predkin at a press conference.
According to the chapter of the RPF, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that so far there were almost no tickets to the match.
The match "Spartacus"- "Locomotive" will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
According to TSS, Spartacus is an active RF champion and Locomotiv is the owner of the country's Cube.
Two young feats cleaned the furniture for 200,000 rubles.
A 37-year-old man with a furniture company spoke to the police the other day.
The man claimed to be stealing expensive tools from the factory, causing serious damage to his production.
The peacocks have become instruments with a total value of almost 200,000 roubles: two welds, a perforator, a hydraulic, a swivel.
The guards began their search for the criminals and soon went to the Bascortostan district of Blasphemy, 23 and 24 years of age.
According to press reports from the Ministry of the Republic, the accomplices entered the premises of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and delivered the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first hit-and-run car service.
They have already been prosecuted for theft, and law enforcement has been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
Hosdep commented on Medvedev's relationship with the U.S.
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Hyzer Nauert in response to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's remarks on two States' relations.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Government stated that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared a full trade war in the Russian Federation.
In commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were at a “low level”, but noted that “areas for interaction” had to be sought.
"Look at the Armistice in the southwest of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says a diplomat RIA Novosti.
In doing so, the foreign policy representative refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by President Donald Trump of the United States on the past Wednesday.
In doing so, he acknowledged that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior has grown roses of amethysts and quartz
The department of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - completes the collection of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They had five new rings and three collars on the barbed strips.
Rose Dior Pré Catelan produced two new rings and balloons from amethysts, pink quartz and bracelets, performed in the technique of glyphs (hand cut by stone) and pavage, dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses that he had grown in his place in Granville by the model Christian Dior and the Paris Gardens Bagatel and Pre-Catellan.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia
President Donald Trump of the United States of America made a strong criticism of the members of the congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have worsened relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, the same people can't even give us medicine," the president tweeted.
Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they are affected by Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently circulated a presidential statement stating that the law would not allow the U.S. to enter into profitable transactions and would bring the Russian Federation, China and North Korea closer together.
A Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy a Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Businessman from Belarus Viktor Prokopenya withdrew a request from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbanka.
Businessmen's decision explained the RBC's intention to “focus on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step would be “the best time invested”, despite the investment attractiveness of buying the daughter of Sberbank.
Mr. Procopenia became the main claimant for the purchase of a unit of the Russian Bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the consortium NorvikBank Grigoria Guselnikova and the Belarusian company Sayid Guteriev in July.
The Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after in March the President of the country, Petr Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their daughters' structures.
One such financial organization, in addition to the VTB and the Ex-Economy Bank, became the Sberbank.
Nowak named the cause of the Blackout in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy, the Russian Federation has identified the cause of the Blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Nowak, made an explanation of the situation.
He said that the peninsula had been deprived of electricity due to an accident in the Krasnodar region.
The truck that was caught in the DTP engaged the electric transmission line, leading to the disconnection of Cuban and related Crimean networks.
The power cuts in the major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Specialists removed the disturbances for several hours.
Initially, it was reported that an anomalous heat could have caused the blekout.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have caused rumors of possible increases.
The Bank of England had warned that economic growth would remain unsustainable and had left interest rates unchanged in the growing pressure on family income.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) experts voted with result 6 to 2 in favour of maintaining the 0.25 per cent rate, with fewer members of the Committee in favour of an increase in the rate this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank limited its forecast to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in autumn.
However, the Bank had warned that increases in the next few years would be necessary to control the burden-bearing inflation, and it was likely that borrowing costs would have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
Committee members also voted in favour of abandoning part of a large set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of a pledge.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan by which it provides cheap loans to the banks, although it has indicated that it is now required to provide another 15 billion pounds under the plan, up to 115 billion pounds.
In the decision-making protocol, the Bank said: “According to the main projections of MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to remain slow in the near future, while the pressure on real incomes of families continues to affect consumption”.
On the question of rates, he reiterated that to halt inflation, “some tightening of financial policies” would be “a little more” than markets were expected.
Markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the following year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “simply” and “restricted”.
Bank projections for this year and next year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank has maintained its forecast of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to € 1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after the recent dissatisfaction in growth had weakened the expectation of an increase; then GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth appears to remain 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The recent report on inflation provided little reason for the joy of households affected by high inflation and a very small increase in wages: According to the bank, pressure will increase before falling.
The Bank added that financial policies “can not prevent” would succeed in earning in the next few years, but expected that salaries “significantly” would be recovered by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared to growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting from the low rate of pounds, which offsets part of the reduced consumption costs.
The decision was taken one year after last August's rates had been reduced to 0.25 per cent following the shocking results of the referendum on the withdrawal from the European Union which had led to the fall of the pound.
It is likely that it will take four years for the Bank to have a full impact on prices and on the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision at the rates, there was an increase in noise around the expected increase in rates, as inflation was pushing more and more households with heavy domestic pressure: the three specialists in the committee asked for an increase of up to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reportedly expected this decline and was again compensated in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate than the planned 2 per cent is entirely due to the low rate of pounds.
Andrew Montlake, director of Korea Mortgage Brokers, said: “If we take into account the recent drop in swaps, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as creditors require business opportunities and expect a good year’s end.
The market is particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as credit refinancing, often with the possibility of a lack of a commission, as well as a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The Public Health Service will prescribe a controversial drug from HIV 10,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” HIV-prevention drug after the Battle of the High Court on financing the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that HIV prevention (PREP), a pre-exposure tablet that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probationary period by about 10,000 persons.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's ruling last year, which stated that the National Health Service had the possibility to pay the PRP, despite its claim that it should be financed by local authorities.
This step, which was announced on Thursday, was called “a major innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Office (NAT) called it “a turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme throughout England by April 2018, veneerological dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be one of the first to start registering people, and even more dispersions will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PRP) is a course of HIV-pre-sexual drugs to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that STD significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
In pre-sexual use of STIs in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs are available to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or at least two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to treatment include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV-positive and fail to receive successful treatment.
The dissipators will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is inhibited by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a doctor of general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in a near-venerological dispensary participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug contract this week following an international procurement tender.
The study is designed to assess all the potential of the PRP for the collection of clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its capacity and its use on a large scale.
“This crucial innovation must complement and reinforce the broad and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone for more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President NAT (National AIDS Control Office), stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PRP, if it is literately targeted at people in need of assistance and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk of HIV will be given access to a new opening tool that can be controlled by a person without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many or many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, president of Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “At the moment, it is essential to make sure that the test is rapidly deployed throughout the country and that no one in the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we have been provided with the PEP pilot, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.”
Tene Minister of People's Health Sharon Hodgeson said: “We very much welcome the start of the STEC test, it is too late because of months of delays and delays on the part of the Government.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the end of transmission of this annual infection.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PR.
It is now important that the test be developed throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk of HIV and move us further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatarstan and Russia adopted a resolution on the support of the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WCC) adopted a resolution which noted the importance of maintaining the presidency in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a well-defined form of organization of the highest public authority in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and social-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
Recall that the treaty between Moscow and Kazanya, which had been in force since 24 July 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, members of the Secretary-General of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to retain the name of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the Federation who has a contract with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one known as “President”.
In Russia, difficulties arose in obtaining international driving rights
The GIBD units are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits.
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait a few weeks in line, which has become a real problem for vacationers who wish to go abroad on their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The ICC was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as it explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
In fact, however, everything depends on specific police or rolling offices: some require IDPs and some are sufficiently national.
In order to be insured, drivers of international rights still receive, but it should be borne in mind that in non-ratified countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or the IMF.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all parts of the GIBDD, reports Kommersant, conducting a study in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow, T-shirts have been unissued in UGIBDD units for four months.
You can sign up for the social services website, but that's where the line was already growing by mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, IDPs cannot be obtained “for technical reasons” without being detailed in the Samarsk region honestly say that there are no forms, and the same situation is being created in other cities.
Many mosquitoes have already encountered the problem, and social media are increasingly reporting:
Irina Burmistruv: "Consequently, why can't international rights be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the GIBDD offices are out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question for people who know!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, far ahead all the time, there is no handout on the place of the vouchers (the button is eating, but the plate cannot give).
It's as if the doorman shows that Spb's time is up to the point.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Is it gonna work?
As explained in the IMF, the requirements for international driving licences have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the Government inspection units.
There may be a deficit, but it is not clear what changes are being made, and this has not been reported in the past.
Blanky procures a special purpose centre for road safety (BDD CS) of the IMF and then supplies them to the units of the GIBDD.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with AO “The Gnostic”: in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 forms were produced by IDPs, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the latest contract was concluded on 18 July with the first printing yard OO for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There is a version that CSN simply failed to make the tender on time, which led to a deficit.
In fact, there are other versions of the lack of forms: many people have started to travel independently, not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights they accept there is not clear to the end, so people are reincarnated, and so there is a huge demand for international “steps”.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass an examination to confirm their qualifications.
Mintrans made such a suggestion.
The international driving licence (IDC) of the new model has been valid since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimea Bridge
Minister of Justice Pavel Petrenko stated that he did not believe Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4th, he interviewed the Observer portal.
No respectable international company will even put a bolt or hook in there because it risks losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia on the Crimea.
“That is, I strongly believe, the prospects for this project are virtually non-existent”, Petrenko said.
He added that Russia considered it unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller-scale facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have been destroyed.
“Therefore, I believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have become so recent to join the project”, said the official.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the Crimean Bridge Motorway.
A massive assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arches on the riverbank has been completed, and its vault is closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the structure.
“At the same time, bridge builders prepared a railway station for the fairway support”, reported at the project information centre.
In April, head Mintransa Maxim Sokolov informed President Vladimir Putin of Russia that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Region.
In Spain, a clerk was fired who hasn't been working for 10 years.
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the public service) was there to have the head of Spanish official Carles Recio?
The permanent period has been growing for 10 long years.
After all, Mr. Recio was dismissed.
But not your direct boss.
What doesn't happen in the world of bureaucrats.
They seem to have been used to all the jokes of the “slaves of the people”.
Yet, officials are constantly amazed at those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, the “sensation” was regretted by Spain.
There, a staff member of Valencia’s Archives, Carles Recio, succeeded in not going to work for ten years.
At the same time, he received regular salary.
The whole solid thing is 50,000 euros a year.
And here's Mr. Resio's "wonderful times."
He was dismissed by the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
In the investigation, it was found that a vicious gambler came to the office every morning at seven o’clock to report to the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he showed up at the workplace at 4 p.m. so he could go back to the system and say that he had left.
Ten years, anyway.
It also became known that all the free time the player spent painting comic books at home.
Members of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia now think how to punish Mr. Recio, the direct supervisor, who could not have been unaware of how to “actively work” in his workplace, his subordinate.
Judges are invited to protect from the Presidents
On behalf of Vladimir Putin, the Presidential Human Rights Council (HRH) has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HR Committee proposes that the powers of the Presidents of the Courts be restricted and that they be elected.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HR would like to introduce special districts that would not be attached to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The HR Committee has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
On instructions from Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after meeting with the members of the Council.
Meeting with members of the Council on 8 December 2016 included individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in the detention facilities (see “U” of 9 December).
The work of the HR Committee resulted in 25 proposals, both concerning the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the Presidents of the Courts to enhance the independence of the remaining judges.
If a candidate for a judge's post has been successful in the competition and received the support of the judiciary, the President of the Court is of the view that he should be presented for appointment without having the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to refer cases between judges.
Experts admit that this can be done by a specially written computer program.
The HR Committee also considers that the President is not entitled to “prevent the results of the judge’s qualification, initiate disciplinary action, decide on additional material payments”.
In doing so, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the “election of the Presidents of the Courts by the judges themselves” and to “give them their powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation”.
All the Presidents of the Courts (from Republic to District) are now appointed for six years by the President on behalf of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HR would suggest a new organization of appeals and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The HRD states that “it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation, not at the level of the regional courts in the entities of the RF, but in the judicial districts”.
Experts take the basis for the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the RF, but that guarantee greater independence from regional officials who are hampered by the use of the “phone law”.
The JHR peace judges propose to strengthen the people's jurors in order to deal with certain “civil and administrative cases” with them.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
“It is only our proposals” explained the “U” member of the HR, Judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamar Morshtkov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only for the HR, but also for the Supreme Court (CC), which had not yet made its proposals.
There is still a time to carry out the mandate of the FP (the co-sponsors, the Office of the Attorney-General and the Human Rights Commissioner in the RF).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the RF, the President of the WS, Váceslav Lebedev, is due until 1 September.
Living a high life: a semi-examination and clever design receptions turned this little apartment into Earls Court into a spacious apartment.
Joan Lee, a former banker who was involved in real estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's lovely typical home, and in favour of the new design, Joan has not picked up her belongings and moved on again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square,” says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day."
Since the first check-in, the apartment has undergone a full reconstruction of 1,000 square feet.
Initially, it was an apartment with one bedroom complex design – to get into the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and a floor to make the most of the generous advantage of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azad from the Notting Hill architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use a 12.5-foot ceiling and create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be suitable for Joan to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms above each other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-arrangement where it could be fully grown.
Erfanu had to think creatively to deal with the brief.
“The work of steel is very complicated”, he explains.
“We had to make room so that they could be above each other, and we didn’t have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they could be at the right height and allow space to be used from above and below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full rooms above each other in the occupied area — and a lot more interesting.
From the half-story through the Printed Copper Light Window of Retrouvius opens a view of the chic hotel below.
The mirror furniture with a gold lining, silver accents, and the interior lighting devices from Serge Muya provide the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of visibility, space and light.
A short corridor framed with mirrors to make it longer.
In the kitchen, a mirror shield appears to be a window in another room.
The mirror cabinets are used to store Joan's entire bowl.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can be a barrier to the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the emerging kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door, like in the garage.
“An engineering art has been involved here,” Erfan will tell of an armed steel tree-wolved shield door.
"It's equipped with an anti-lock, so when you push the door up, it's very easy to slip."
With reasonable space and storage facilities, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom, and improved planning.
“In the end, the sex square is exactly what you will sell, i.e., what your real estate is estimated to be”, says Erfan.
“In other words, a real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on sexes.”
Here they were able to increase the sex area by using quality materials that provide shades of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the house”, says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with an electric wire in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch our hearts."
This serves as a sign that a good design and an increased yard can turn out to be something that's usually amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
Government approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Government of Russia has approved the establishment of a State Cultural Policy Commission.
The relevant decision was published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be to develop and adapt strategic approaches to cultural policy implementation.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify tasks and prepare new programmes for their implementation.
The Chief Commission is appointed as Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation approved in 2016 a plan to implement the State Cultural Policy Strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and measures to enhance the influence of Russian culture in other countries, the preservation of a common cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to a minimum of eight years
The rise in consumer prices in G20 countries has declined to the minimum of eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent - lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
In the past, Rosstat reported a decline in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
The department thus recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The Russian inflation rate is 4.1 per cent, according to Minfin.
Microeconomics, however, believes that the target has already been achieved, according to the version of the agency, is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against illegal dumping of Baykal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned of the illegal destruction of forests during the meeting on environmental development in Baikal territory.
During the course of the event, Sergey Donsky, Minister of Natural Resources, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It permits deforestation during the fires, and the Government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored so that “all was not taken out in a row” during the process of cutting off.
Donski noted that the draft law entailed monitoring by the IMF and the supervisory agencies.
Media: WSU fighters secretly from the command are negotiating with Donbass militia
The line of armed conflict in Donbass has been regularly telephoned.
Controversial fighters are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know about this at headquarters.
The VSU and Donbass militia have established cell phones away from their high command.
On 4 August, Strana.ua reported on this with reference to members of the Donbass military operation.
According to the publication, unit commanders know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
There is no domestic communication: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactic arrangements”.
Often the result of such conversations is a truce on a certain section of the front.
Journalists were informed of cases in which an officer received congratulations on his birthday from the front line of his formal enemy.
WSA fighters and DNR and LNR militias have been sitting in trenches on the delineation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has outraged the blocking of UNSC statements on attacks against the Embassy of the Russian Federation
In the Russian foreign policy office, individual Western diplomatic representatives have been outraged by the actions that block UN Soviet statements in the press condemning terrorist attacks by the Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Health.
The department recalled that the territory of the Embassy of Russia in Damascus on 2 August had been subjected to mortar attacks on the part of the terrorist groups Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (the former Jabhat Al-Nusra, banned in the RF) and Fajlak Ar-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of “Nurry” as a terrorist organization, and UNSC resolutions call for opposition to this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that “it would appear that the Nurry attacks should face a general unequivocal and resolute condemnation, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessment of the sanctions against diplomatic missions”.
However, as stressed in the journal, "for the third time a month now, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine on the UN Security Council have, by alternating the tone of objections, with the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard draft statement by the Security Council to press condemning terrorist attacks on Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital."
We would not want diplomatic solidarity to remain with us in the conscience of those delegations.
“The most disturbing fact that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to further provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity” was stated in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have the belief that someone in the Security Council is working with them”.
Vladimir Putin favoured limiting the number of extracurricular business checks
President Vladimir Putin of Russia stated during an investment project meeting in the Far East that the number of extra-planned business inspections should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of planned ones, as well as the need to limit inspections to ten days.
“Extreme inspections are usually carried out without agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent is in agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office, all the rest are self-executing”, quoted President TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prohibit investigators from downloading servers and hard drives from businesses.
In addition, in the opinion of the President, business associations should be given the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
“This will hopefully bring some positive results in business cases or in violation of the entrepreneurship law”, said the Head of State.
As reported by the "U", the number of other types of business inspections is increasing due to a moratorium on planned inspections.
In May, at the request of the business ombudsman to the President of Russia, Boris Titov was interviewed, which revealed that the planned checks had actually been replaced by extra-plant checks (the proportion of those affected by them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raiders (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on citizens ' claims (from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).
More details on the business checks in "U" material came to the other side of the small business.
Brothers struggle for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers fought for one of Victoria’s largest empires in real estate trade worth over $500 million -- forty years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and founder Colin de Lutis live in the Palace of Turak three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him before the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but there's still a heated divorce dispute in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother, Anne's brothers have 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a shop at Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family was founded by Westco Jeans, which grew up on a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the de lutis family's property list includes office buildings today, offices under construction in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and Mount Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father Colin, whom Paul describes as the “main driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about a third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The property and money section became Paul’s stumbling block.
"The chapter proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of ownership," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed reconciliation attempts, the first hearings were held at the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing about who would be in control of the existing business - from which Paul thought Colin had ruled it out.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but he accuses Paul of incompetent management of certain facilities.
In statements given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he hoped that the dispute would be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family a top priority," he wrote.
Trial costs are rising as snowfall: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are attached to the case; both parties have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including royal lawyer Alan Myers, and the best hipsters.
Mrs. DeLuci and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they ruled dairy bars and estronoms and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family ginsov shop.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grade of school, and Paul was a boy at that time (about 10 years old).
Anna DeLutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possessions to sons without conflict.
"Luiji often told me she didn't want the brothers to be tried," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, no longer belong to DeLucis; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business and Luke was 26 million.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark were “unsatisfactory financial conditions for their separation”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL Club and, according to Eddie McGheer's 2015 biography, the best friend on television.
Farfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
He replied only to Colin, the text message which stated that since the case had not yet been dealt with in court, “I am not really saying anything.”
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and shake the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that "still hopes to resolve the conflict".
On Friday, that hope seems to have spread out.
"The verdict in our case will soon be brought to justice," Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trump office plans to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House head plans to limit the flow of information to President Tramp, including news reports from the media, in the hope of keeping the Chief calmer.
That's what reporter Josh Doozie reports.
“At a meeting held by John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House apparatus, with the head of the apparatus on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House of President Donald Trumpe, which he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the President.”
Kelly told the staff that information should go through it in paper form or through briefings, because it would be better for the president to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis is completely correct, but others have already failed in trying to calm Thrompe by tracking his information.
President Trump's relationship with television took place decades ago -- and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had received fair coverage in publications that could be overemphasized," Sam Nanberg, a former electoral adviser, said in February.
Tara Palmery then wrote in Politico that “the six former members of the Electoral Headquarters, in order to keep under control the Thrompe habit of writing on Twitter, should be monitored for a constant flow of praise in the personal information received to him”.
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing on Twitter was ever "under control" was ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the election headquarters know something that we don't know -- for example, that if they hadn't, Thrompe tweets would have been even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump did not publish.
If his staff had kept him from troubles at least once, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump a material - reliable or not - which confirms their views.
"Policy" -- right on this story -- wrote in May about the propensity of advisers to constantly suggest questionable information to the President.
Here's one example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"The current and former Trump staff say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially with dangerous leaks, and will not calm down until he finds who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone made an article with GotNews.com to the President, the website of the Internet provocater Charles K. Johnson, in which the deputy head of Kathy Welsh's apparatus was accused of “standing behind a series of leaks” in the White House.
It does not matter that Johnson is forever confused about Twitter's aggressive behavior, that he has not provided specific facts or that he has in the past made false accusations and then renounced them.
Trump read the article and asked the staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then Chief of Staff Raines Pribus and Rob Porter's Secretary “have tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of paper that Trump receives.”
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly tries to do the same thing.
Maybe he'll be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Tramp still has the impulse, and his assistants still fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen Procurator's Office is fighting a HIV dissident.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the decision of the Kalineni Raider Tumena, who had ceased the criminal case against a local resident who had lost her young daughter to HIV.
As a result, the child died because the mother was an HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office considers that the crime cannot be left unpunished so as not to set a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against Tumena's resident was brought under Art. 109 of the Criminal Code in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection 4B.
According to the prosecution, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
“The woman did not heal herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection”, explained the prison prosecutor's office.
The criminal case took place in the Kalineski Raid Tumena on 25 July, which decided to terminate it.
The complainant filed the complaint with the father of the girl who died and explained that “he forgave the wife, she has no claim, she has smoothed out the damage and apologized.”
The prosecutor ' s office did not agree with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to close the case be annulled and referred to the court for further consideration.
The girl died, and it is impossible to undo the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the advice of the doctors, refused to study and treat the baby from a dangerous infection”, reported to the press service of the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
According to the supervisory authority, it should be punished or followed by other HIV-dissidents.
According to the prison AIDS centre, about 12 children with HIV are now not receiving medical attention because of parental refusal.
“And this situation has already improved, in the year of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV changed their opinion, allowing for a diagnosis, taking medications”, said AIDS secretary Elena Loseva.
She said that it was not possible to influence parents in a legislative way, and that, as a result, not all HIV-infected children could be detected - mothers did not allow them to study, hide themselves, run away from hospitals with their children.
What are the dangers of HIV-dissidents?
At the end of last year, Peterburg sociologists presented the results of the first study of the so-called HIV-dissident movement in Russia.
HIV-dissidents are called people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Health professionals and AIDS-service activists of the NCAs call such views anti-medical, and they pose a serious threat to their spread.
A terrible photo shoot that ended with a tragedy took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grecen railway station in Chmelnickom.
A merry company of drunk young people walked a bridge over the railways, where the cargo train was just standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make an effective self-sail on the roof of the wagon, and reported FACTAM in the police communications sector in Kmelnicki district.
The guy started going down from the bridge to the train, but because of his recklessness, he caught the electric transmission line and immediately struck the current.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station's dispatcher, who immediately called the "necessary".
Prior to the arrival of the victim’s doctors, they moved to a safe place and then hospitalized the Hmelnik district clinic.
Men were diagnosed with fat burns from 1 to 2 degrees.
Now his condition is judged to be stable.
Lawyers remind us that recently, extreme selves have become increasingly popular on rooftops of multi-tiers, bridges, and traffic.
The police call on people to be vigilant and to avoid such photos, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists allow the existence of the oceans in ancient Venus
Oceans could exist in ancient Venus.
French scientists made that assumption.
Specialists have developed a computer model that has demonstrated the process of water formation on the planet's surface, says Science News.
It has been found that at the beginning of its history, there were oceans in which there was 10 per cent more water than now on Earth.
Previously, "The Instruments of the Week" had written that according to scientists' hypothesis, the ocean 4 billion years ago could have existed on Mars as well.
Foreign experts in their studies found that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people injured as a result of shooting in the park in San Francisco
Three people are injured in San Francisco as a result of the shooting, and the Associated Press reports.
The incident took place in Dolores Park, where there was a large number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them pulled out a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the maliciouss could not be considered, as they had closed all but their eyes.
Another was given medical care, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, and there is no detail about his condition.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured while shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Some visitors were injured in an attempt to leave the premises.
rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaule
The Louna rock band concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
Musicians will present their new album "The Strange New World", which has become one of the most expected releases of the year.
The collective is preparing a conceptual show that will become the brightest in the group's concert history.
"The Strange New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Loun.
His name is associated with the famous novel-anti-tutopia O. Haxley "A Strange New World".
New songs do not tell the book, but tell about the society that lives under the law of anti-dutology, “blind belief in propaganda and imposed values”.
More than 1,200 people supported the project on the “Planeta.ru” website.
Louna released in 2010.
Two years later, musicians presented the "Time X" album, and in 2013 they recorded the "We are Louna" album (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna presented a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the Songs of Peace programme.
In the Lusine Gevorkyan group (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas-gitara), Ruben Kazaryan (gitara), Sergei Ponkratiev (gitara), Leonid Kinzbursky (Barabanas).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club "Faraon" on 17 October at 7 p.m.
Price of tickets: 1200 to 2600 roubles.
Louna is one of the required groups on the Russian rock scene.
The collective was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group won several rounds in various nominations of the Chertva Dužina hit parade.
Gypsies crossed the trenches and returned to the Millionaires Street
Some of the most wealthy Western Midland homeowners are once again in conflict with the determined Roma who have overcome the outpouring of the municipal authorities of the trenches to reclaim the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 homes on wheels in a field bordering with the rich street of Solikhall, who had been given the joking name “the street of the Millionaires”.
Bringing with them horses, babies, and many homes on wheels, they returned after being expelled no further than in May, and did not interfere with the trenches that were dug out by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasions.
This tactical company found a gap in defence facilities and resisted its vehicles through a site that was left unprotected to leave room for a trope.
The people who were angry attacked by the municipality of Solikhalla, saying that he had been “incapacitated to solve the problem”.
An anonymous local resident said: “They came here on Monday evening, after they were driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.”
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were banished, and they came back again.
More gypsies arrived last night, and today perhaps even more.
“The Birmingham municipality knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term court decisions to protect their parks”, she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it."
A local resident who wished to remain anonymous said: "This is funny; we have just seen these Gypsies leaving the previous time, and, please, this attack continues."
This time, there were more of them, and we even saw a horse graze on the meadow."
A representative of the municipality of Solikhalla said: “We know of an illegal camp on land near Stratsbruck Road and cooperate with the Solikhalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action to banish them as soon as possible”.
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior on the phone.
This allows us to come up with an understanding of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea's action is the champagne wine plant "New Light"
The Criminal Police of the Republic of Crimea “The Institute of Champagne Wines “New World” has decided to take action by transforming the “Institute of the Champagne Wines “New Light” into the OAO, according to the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations, Crimea Annuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in Crimea's household.
The capital of the stock company will amount to 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubes each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if there were no funds to upgrade the plant within the next three years, there would be a threat of a factory stop.
The size of the plant is approximately 60 to 70 per cent.
The enterprise needs 1.2 billion rubes to be upgraded, and due to its legal and organizational characteristics, it is obliged to make 50% of its revenue.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"To get the money from the owner is problematic, to talk about attracting loans from large credit organizations difficult," said Mr. Crimea Sergey Petelin's title in April this year.
The Crimea Parliament has included an enterprise in the privatisation plan for 2017.
It was suggested that it be made available and traded.
The source of Interfax in Crimea's authorities estimated the possible cost of selling the company in $40 million, investment of the investor in modernization - another $30 million.
"New World" in 2016 increased the production of boar wines by 2.8 per cent from 2015 to 1,52 million bottles.
In 2017, New Light intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lviv Golicini as a plant for the production of wine in his name New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
More than 40 tombs were destroyed by lower - city third - graders
The MoU staff in the Nijegrad district identified citizens who had destroyed 46 tombs at the cemetery in Lyskovo.
The third - grade students were the instigators.
The first statement that the grave plates were damaged by unknowns was received to the Russian OMVA on the Lyskov region on 27 June.
In all, 24 persons were contacted by the police.
As a result, criminal proceedings under article 244 of the Criminal Code have been initiated “Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police found suspects, two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing monuments fall, and this led them to bullying.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone with the ships of NGOs saving migrants.
Italy had warned NGOs belonging to rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new regulations governing their activities.
“If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities”, said Interior Minister Mario Minniti in an interview with the Turkish daily newspaper Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, on suspicion that his crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been working for the entire year, has abandoned the commentaries on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartosio.
“For us, the salvation of human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue zone now”, states the statement of the organization in the social media.
"We will be able to assess all the charges put forward now, only after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa vessel belonging to Jugend Rettet since October.
His crew suspected that all the lifeboats had been taken aboard migrants who were sent directly to them by traffickers and allowed smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting was expected to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coastline, as stated in the allegations published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian Coastal Authority that control rescue operations in the area, rather from humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct basically implies that the Juventa courts will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three out of nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to obey the Code: Save the Children, Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Pro-Activa Proliferation embraces from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they did not entail any “significant changes or disturbances” to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we began to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we do not want to associate ourselves with either side of the conflict”
The RF authorities have recently significantly intensified their policies in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations from opposing Libyan parties have taken part.
The head of the Russian contact group on intra-Libyan settlement at the Ministry of Interior and Gosdum, Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told “U” what the goals of Moscow in the region were and who was being put at the stake.
The contact group on Libya that you lead is almost unknown.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine knows about it.
And here's the curtain of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Duma.
Its activities are controlled by the Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (deputate Duma of Chechnya. - "U").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the Gosduma by Váceslav Waldens.
The arrest in Libya of the Russian tanker Mehanik Chebotarev (in September 2015, 11 people were on board. - "U").
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of Gosduma, supported our work by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it turn out to be what you led her on?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to lead the group.
Our work has not been limited to the release of seafarers from Mechanic Chebotareva.
We have been able to establish contact with all major factions facing each other in the Libyan conflict - and by Tripoli (where the UN-established Government is headed by Faiz Saraj. - " U") and Tobrooke (a residence of Parliament that opposes the Government and supports the marshal Halif Haftar, who controls the eastern areas of Libya. - "U").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister Libya - "U"), we quickly agreed to release Russian seafarers.
It was then decided to use these contacts more effectively, to establish a contact group.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and to engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize, in Libya, that we do not want to associate ourselves with either side of the conflict, and we are engaged in a dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group, and how many are in Libya all the time?
The contact group now includes five persons.
Among them are people with experience in power structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We would also like to introduce a team of specialists on the region, representatives of the Institute for the Middle East of the RAF.
There is no one ever in Libya, and there is no need for that.
There are now Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military professionals in Libya.
All discussions and publications on this are not true.
But your ex-military contact group is...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurat (where militia units are based, playing a role in overthrowing Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in subsequent years. - "U").
We came to Misurat in January of this year.
We were scared, they said that there would be Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to evaluate the situation ourselves there, to analyse the real military potential, who is responsible for why such rumors are being heard, what the role of Islamists really is.
In Misurat, we met with all the troops involved in the destruction of IGs in Sirte (in December 2016, this town on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from militants banned in Russia by the Islamic State - "U").
We wanted to see them, get to know these people, check out information that they were the ones who played a crucial role in destroying EG in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these to himself.
And to what conclusion have you come?
The Islamic State in Libya didn't beat Haftar?
That's not what he was doing.
Haftar performed operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And IGs in Sirta have been struggling with structures under the Government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we've invited people to Russia to do this anti-terrorist operation.
And they came -- the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April of this year, and the Libyan delegation was accepted by the Council of the Federation, the Dome, the Ministry and the Rosgvardiyah.
You, as we understand it, are in all Libyan regions and are likely to be in the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it would be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections that were reached in late July in Paris in Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or, as has happened many times in the past, agreements will be broken, fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power by themselves?
The fact that Sarah and Haftar agreed to another meeting was already a good signal for us, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on board the Russian carrier Admiral Kuznets on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But the Misurati didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who have come to us today."
But our task is to show that we are not only supporting Haftar, we are engaged in a dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar had an affair.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he was studying twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, he's very relative.
But what we have learned certainly facilitates dialogue with him.
And it's not just with him.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And that's what they say in Russian.
And as far as Russia is concerned, to some extent they're nostalgic about it.
Do you consider the likely speedy abolition of the armed embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not engage anyone in this conflict, and we do not wish to arm each other to the detriment of others.
We would like all to be in an approximately equal position.
With regard to the arms embargo, Libyans have consistently called for Russia to somehow facilitate its withdrawal.
The process of drafting a constitution is on the move now in Libya.
We hope that the parties will make compromise decisions and reach an internal consensus.
The elections would then have to be held, as mentioned at the meeting of Saraja and Haftar.
If elections are held and legitimate power is finally elected (and now none of the parties has such status), the issue of the lifting of the arms embargo may be raised in the United Nations Assembly.
To raise this issue is now pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of conflict.
It was reported in the media that Italy, which had encountered the problem of African refugees from Libya, felt abandoned to the fate of its allies from the EU.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its connections with Libyans?
How, for example, is the realistic option that Haftar's troops will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow is engaged in dialogue both with Haftar and Saraj and with Misurato and with the south of the country.
In this regard, the tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it going to cross the stream of migrants in faraway controversies?
So, on average, they're starting the buses back in which the Nigerian migrants are going?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing to flow.
We hope, however, to facilitate the integration of the Yuan in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But for the first time, we would like to see unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The Head of Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of Shariah norms.
How radical is he?
Would that not be an obstacle to our relationship with Russia or the West?
I'll give my own opinion about him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, the opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he is of the view that Libya must be an absolutely normal country -- a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he get that reputation?
It has been created by those countries that are not interested in Russia to communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, and there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government entities.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of the way.
And we mixed all the cards with them, and we started to communicate actively with Tripoli and Tobrooke.
We are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with the State Oil Company of Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanall, with whom Head Rossnefti Igor Sechin made a deal, himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was a first shipment of Libyan oil from Rosneft.
What is Russia going to do with it?
I guess I'll sell it.
And what other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign contracts concluded with Muammar Gaddafi.
These include previous transport arrangements (railway construction), energy (electricity) and a number of others.
Is there anything for Libyans to pay?
Well, they have oil.
Is that what this is, like with Iran, about oil in exchange for services?
I don't know what the scheme is, I don't really care about these questions.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main issue.
In fact, we are in the area of peacekeeping.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree between themselves so that they can establish order, and Libya has ceased to be a favourable environment for the development of terrorism.
It is for Russia that is the main task of helping the Libyan people and delivering terrorists from there.
Do you have any record of the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that so far no Russian or other countries of the former USSR have been present.
He said that he had some 50,000 phone records from Islamic and radical groups (Libya. - "U") and Russian did not speak there.
And from what nations, then, are these fighters?
I wouldn't want to go into that detail.
Well, then, let's put it another way.
How many Islamist militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans, no more than 5 per cent.
The rest are coming.
Could Moscow hold intra-Lebian negotiations on the example of Paris?
That's the plan.
We are engaged in active talks with Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have indicated their willingness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
Several visits are still to be made, and then I hope that there will be clarity on the timing and venue of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the charity raised money for a dear gift to a sick boy
In the Melikhovo Museum of Under-Moses, a nine-year-old boy named Sasha Mazola, who owns DCP, hydrocephalia of the brain and complete blindness, will receive a special escape route on 5 August.
A useful presentation is presented by Sashe, Minister of Culture of Moscow Region Oksan Kosarev and Director of the Museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The training money was collected during the charity marafon “Don’t Get Up to Do Good”, which took place in Melíchov on 15 July on the day of Chekov’s memory.
On the eve of a marafon in the museum, a letter was received from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino of Chekhov district, saying, "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a runaway gift to make my legs strong, and I'd just learn to walk a little bit."
And here's Sashin's dream come true!
After the service, the concert postscript will take place in the museum and will be a well-known pianist, well-deserved artist of Russia, Alexander Gindin will perform the pomours of popular classical works.
During the charity maraffon in Melihov, there was a choir of Voznan Davydov Desert, the masters of Ilya Drosdikhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory of P.I. Chaikovsky and the Russian Academy of Gniessey, the artists of the Melihov theatre of Chekhovska Studio.
The visitors were given auctions, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with a marafone logo.
The Melichovo Museum of Charity took the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of Chekov on 15 July a day of charity in all the Podmoskovya Museums.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevska Gitomir district near a local football stadium shot a few times in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was outraged by noise, reported FACTAM in the Gitomir Police Communications Division.
Then a man came to a cafe nearby.
The building had a conflict in which the man used the device to fire rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical assistance and no threat to his life.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene, but by that time the gunman had hidden.
The security forces identified him and detained him on the same day, on 2 August.
The man was unable to explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullets shot device that's sent to the lab.
Criminal proceedings under article 296 (Hulligence) of the Criminal Code have been initiated.
The detainee is threatened with deprivation of liberty for a period of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that an attack took place in Kyiv on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya Street on the night of 28 July.
Michel Carter's sentence for reports of Conrad Roy's suicide
Massachusetts resident was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment because she was motivated by text messages and phone calls to commit suicide by her boyfriend, Conrad Roy.
Michel Carter, now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months in prison and another 5 years in probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who died with him on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday's hearings, "My family is killed by grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free before the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy were suffering from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence of standing, shaking hands, and letting his eyes down.
"By her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not recognize responsibility," she said.
"She hasn't shown any remorse."
But lawyer Carter said it was a "tragic case she deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that he felt that her “age, maturity or even mental illness had not significantly affected her. ”
The prosecutor read out Roy Lynn Roy's mother's statements saying, "It hasn't been a day since I mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I am doing - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Roya's sister Camdin Roy said that she had always been haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or be his children's aunts.
"A man who has always been with me since I was born is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case would seem to be a legal precedent, since Massachusett did not have a law that provided for a man's responsibility to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roya was found dead in a car with symptoms of vesicular gas poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that he had been pushed to commit suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know how many ways," she wrote in a couple of messages sent two weeks before his death when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted Roy's death to pay attention, and he banned her from talking to the press so she wouldn't get what she wanted.
The legal opinions on this matter have been divided.
One of the few who protected Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for killing her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published a special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Mischel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flight bird."
One of the best basketball players in the One League of WTB, 33-year-old Keith Langford, left UNIS.
President Evgeny Bogachev of the United States defender “The Witnesses” commented.
Keith made that decision on family circumstances, as Eugeny Bogachev said.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons at UniCs and showed a high level in each match, and he went 100%.
That's why I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and play careers.
Keith Langford played at the Kazakstan Club for three years, winning the Single League silver-2015/16.
In the season-2016/17 he received the award of the most successful Euroliga season player.
He scored 21.75 points on average for a match.
This result has been the second since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of Euroliga, who received the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with Shenzhen in China, informs Eurohoops.
An American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be second to July as the star of Euroliga, who enters the Chinese championship.
In the past, Jannis Buruss, an ex-centered Panatinaikos, moved to CBA.
The sun-burning tourist from Podmoskovya evacuated by helicopter in Adigai
The Adjay rescuers today evacuated from the mountain area of the submarine tourist who received the heavy sunburns.
The man rested at the Fisht shelter at a height of 16,000 meters.
A 27-year-old tourist has had increased pressure and difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
Rescuers were approached by the leader of the tour team, who said that the men had been burned on the march.
Audi to be modified to 850,000 diesel cars
On the day before the announcement by Audi BMW, it was proposed to update software in more than 350,000 cars.
The Chairman of the BMW stated that the company believed that “there were more intelligent ways than restrictions on driving,” referring to European cities, including Munich, where the BMW was located, which were considering prohibiting or restricting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler stated on Thursday that it modified three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies said they had responded.
European autoproducers actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States in order to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install equipment that neutralize diesel gases is also rising, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive car price.
While German car manufacturers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Government has also accused itself of plunging powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying not to repeat the Folkswagen errors, which have hidden the use of so-called “threat devices” which may, during testing, correct the number of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules and, in normal driving conditions, are disconnected.
In the United States, several Folkswagen leaders were convicted and the rest were prosecuted on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department of the Audi engine development team was arrested in Germany.
Former manager, Zacceo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was caught under the German criminal investigation involving Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to circumvent European emission regulations and expanded the investigation previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can create serious problems for Folkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of disproportionately high income for Folkswagen.
In Astrahan, the visitor paid off the café with false money.
The police received a report from the bank's staff member on the detection of funds coming from the general public, a suspicious denomination of 5,000 roubles.
A study conducted at the Expert and Criminal Centre revealed that it was false.
According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Astrahan Region, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors to the café that bought the shawarma.
It is worth noting that the cashier was not equipped with a tool for determining the authenticity of the bills.
Currently, police officers are assigned persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a knowingly falsified CB RF ticket.
Such offences are punishable by imprisonment of up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages residents of the Astrahan Region to be careful in financial transactions; it is recommended that workers in the trade sector be equipped with tools to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found an ad hoc planet that can even melt iron on it.
Having first studied the characteristics of the stratospheric exoplanet named WASP-121b, astrophysicists were amazed at its temperature, which could evaporate iron and other metals.
Specialists have noted that water molecules are so hot with the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope has sealed the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: it's high temperature that causes the planet's atmosphere to glow in an infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to so-called "hot juptiles" - gas giants, size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to a parent star.
As a result of this year, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 “earthly” days, with its gas shell radiated to nearly 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens a lavender in Provans.
It has become a symbol of Provans and South France, but now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda grew worse because of the dry weather and insect diseases, which caused constant headaches among scientists and farmers who were trying to find solutions.
Eric Shes, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provanda, says: “Lawanda in Provans is indeed under threat because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the autumn rains, it has become much smaller.
This affects the life expectancy of the lavender.
And there are tiny cicads that jump down the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, they get very much."
There's a lot on the map.
Labanda not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very much needed in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: "We have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent instead of very long hips with a large number of large colors.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing air oil."
The decisions currently under consideration include improving the distribution of water and deceleration of evaporation from soil, as well as spraying of soil and water protection plants and dry-resistant varieties.
Ambassador of Winter University-2019 met with red-headed schoolchildren
The two-time hockey champion of the world, Ambassador of Winter University-2019 Alexander Semin met on the eve of the early hockey players and distributed autographs to the dentists.
The meeting took place at the Winter University tent in 2019 as part of the thematic week on Shiba hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on horseback on a ski slope.
In addition, estaphets, Victorians and games were organized with the playing of the souvenirs of student games, and the separation from the aerobics federation.
Fifty schoolchildren attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the children to do as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the beginning of their education was hard work and a great desire to engage in hockey.
"It is great that in Krasnoyarsk there is a site such as the Winter University-2019 tent, where starting athletes can directly ask questions to team coaches," the champion said.
Note that the ambassadors of the University of Winter Ages-2019 are helping to promote student sport and healthy lifestyle.
The chalice of the university will work throughout the summer season until 25 September, reports a press service to the Winter University-2019 Directorate.
Medvedev commented in Gosdepa
U.S. State Department official Hyzer Nauert, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, commented on the need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found in order to “improve bilateral interaction”.
This successful cooperation was illustrated by the Syrian Armistice Agreement.
We are two nuclear super-Powers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
However, Nauairt refused to comment on Medvedev's claim for a full trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said so, she certainly has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this," said the representative of Mr. Gossip.
Formerly President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, Prime Minister Medvedev of the Russian Federation stated that Washington had declared a full trade war on Moscow, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that the US sanctions would operate for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister, the United States “purchased” Trump, considered the example.
Lost in Podmozkowya found a bodyguard on someone else's memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road in Noginsk on 25 July under very spicy circumstances: he left the car compartment to go to the bathroom.
Seven days were unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and locals.
And Shamil was found at a stranger's house in Ramensko.
He was found naked in his master's bathroom.
A Dagestan athlete was unable to explain how he came to be here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and the passport was gone.
The identity was helped to announce his disappearance.
The medical personnel who arrived at the door recorded Hanmetov's partial memory loss and brain injury, said the Mash community.
There's probably other surprises waiting for the athletes.
Thieves who kidnapped Shamil may have already visited his apartment, the keys to which he was also stolen.
The oil and gas revenues of July exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, the oil-gas revenues generated in July 2017 exceeded the estimate of 7.4 billion rubes, according to the Ministry of Finance.
The excess, as explained by the department, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to rubble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as to the excess actual gas production and export volume of oil products at projected levels.
“The deviation from the monthly estimates of the Federal Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 for petroleum gas revenues is projected to be +40.2 billion rubs in August 2017”, says the report.
Consequently, the total amount of foreign exchange funds allocated to the domestic currency during the period from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of the foreign currency would be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubs.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by Minfin Russia.
Every working day during this period, the CB will enter into foreign exchange transactions on organized auctions of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the course of the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Officials of the weekly newspaper Riodosé usually meet on Wednesday to discuss plans to highlight the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa State involving organized crime, corrupt officials or ongoing war criminals.
But today, overcome by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: to take the children with them to an office in which they had already dropped out of the grenade in 2009 or to leave their homes.
Security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - proof is not needed, suspicions and internal sensations will be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a whole list of drug dealers, which makes the work of highlighting chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence has not been a stopover, and among the corpses that are growing in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Journalist Protection Committee, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nyeto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven people have already died in seven states this year.
Among the latter are their publisher and instigator, founder of Riodos, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The big mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence feels very sharp, although his presence is widespread — a large picture of Valdez showing his middle finger with the inscription “Justice” hanging on the facade of the Ríodose building; two reporters of 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts depicting his smile, face in the glasses or his firm master.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was organized in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated, according to the Journalist Protection Committee.
As in the case of most of the thousands of drug trafficking and organized crime killings each year, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Ríodose journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although it is much more dangerous around now.
Without information about the killers, without justice from the security talks at the meetings, Ibarr says.
"It's very stupid to spend time at this seminar," he says.
"until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdes left the office of Riodos in the capital city of Culiacane.
He was able to drive only a few blocks before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twenth River".
The shooter drove off on his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two grown children.
Rumors usually spread rapidly across the Kuliacan.
But almost everyone's silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the created vacuum.
Let us not say that one or more people are killed on Sinaloa streets every day, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two - story mausoleums of drugs, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of "comfort" is just when one of the cartels takes control of the sea state with important ports and drug trafficking routes in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was overwhelmed by the guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes have helped the murder.
First, in February an interview with Damaso López, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions that fights with the sons of Guzman, was published.
The publication could have pissed off the sons; the people who were allegedly gang members bought all the copies of the editions as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that had written about the same story had been seized.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He'd been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and, in 2003, together with five colleagues, he founded Riodos, selling his $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to deal with journalism without affecting the topic of drugs," Bohorkes said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publication, sales, and advertising.
Journalists liked that they were able to publish bold reports without fear of censorship, but the readers were attracted to what they could read in this publication about which no one was ever more daring to write.
Eight years after the founding of Riodos, Maria Murs Cabo was awarded the prestigious Marie Moores Award for a reporter's work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Free Press Prize for Courage in the Investigation of Mexico's Drug Trade, wherever it may lead.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ award.
He said in an interview with Rompijento TV in October last year in Sinaloa, “this is the way of life”.
"You have to accept tasks that lie down on you either as a journalist or whatever, or you're just messing with a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around here... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Ríodos miss Valdez, a shoemaker who fought like a trucker in port, a friend, generous in arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to live.
They relied on their order.
He should always have worn his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, has he been destroyed by love of one-time order?
His death caused them to doubt how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you when you know their wives, their children, their legal business, and the underground airports to transport drugs.
"These things were beyond the line," said Bochorkes.
The result, even at the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
We have to trust our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says editor "Riodos" Andres Villareal, is that "obsess can be deceived... and then what happens to Javier."
The old rules, he says, are no longer in Sinaloa, like Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft keeps changing.
In a room where Riodos staff gathered for security training, cell phones were suddenly banned: a few days before it became known that spying programmes sold exclusively to Governments were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Outside, two police officers are hidden in the shade of a tree from a 104-degree burn (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the State Government to guard the office of Riodose, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois district of Kuliakan.
Some journalists asked if these police officers were among the 50 per cent of the officials of the order that the governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area under the control of drug traffickers.
In the next issue of Riodos, three main topics were considered.
It's murder at Sinoloa's brother of the former boxing champion Julio Cezar Chavez.
They also had the release of government expenditures concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliakan, a neighborhood away from the DA's office.
It was not officially announced who had been abducted or how it had happened, so caution was needed when the time had come to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant simultaneously for drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered for a policy belonging to the ruling Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of power for almost the past century.
Recently, massive allegations of corruption have been brought against several governors of PRI.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when Guzman's son El Chapo slipped away from the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have sought Valdez's column with the most reliable kidnapping information.
"We would have known what had happened sooner," said 46-year-old Villareal, for his artistic body called El Flaco.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been ripped apart."
Valdez's office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the murder of journalists because the staff have become what they never thought they would be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took some posters and went to a demonstration next morning at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the western part of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Journalists throughout the country have been louder, protesting and writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to secure international support for the Valdez justice claim.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez Ramirez, the authorities accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
After that, she asked for no further assignments to highlight the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would damage its objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “circumcised” by organized crime, its accomplices in government and indifferent society.
In his last book, "Drug Journalist" he wrote that reporters are not just killed by gangs of drug dealers; they do so under orders from politicians and security services who are in conflict with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee considers that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by order of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
She found a note on her body, allegedly written by Zetas' cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
Computer keyboards and headphones were next to her head cut off.
Some publications preferred to close up like El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on to the El Manyana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Dario de Cudad Juárez publicly approached drug cartels with a editorial on the first page, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists left their home states or country at all.
It's a painful decision.
Exile work is difficult to find, and they continue to look for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it seems, by a photographer named Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after leaving Veracruz.
Those who continue to work balance risk solutions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he was afraid to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he said.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last release was ready for press, the editors of Riodose sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when their phones called at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces were left near the resort city of Masatlan, after which, according to confirmed reports, 19 corpses.
The war continued to ignite, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they put the news on the Riodos website via their mobile phone.
The next day, I had to reschedule the first page.
The sirens are not far away, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bochorkes saw whether the police officers guarding them were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the sight of all Sinaloa, the Riodos staff continued his work.
"How can you think of shutting down," said Bochorkes, "if on the very day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to do a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, although he is appalled.
The researchers reported that the early remains of an incredible rhino-sized substance discovered by the Canadian miner remained so well that experts called it “Monas Lisa among the dinosaurs”.
It remained so well that they could even determine that the color of his combed skin was colorful and brown - and say that he had, in some way, a "dark past".
In a report published in Modern Biology, it was described as “the most well preserved of Tireophorus in all history of finds and one of the best copies of the world’s dinosaurs”.
It is a recently found nodozave copy that lived in the middle of the mill period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible well - being has fooled researchers who call him “really remarkable. ”
This herbivorous tyreophorus is the most well - preserved fossil in the history of the findings, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Sancor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from the environment and decided to look more closely.
His excavation was sent to the Royal Tirrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, a mass of 2,500 feet (100 kg) was employed to find animals inside the ground depth.
Now that all this hard work has been done, the outcome can be demonstrated.
“It’s only a bit of a shame, and you can almost believe he’s asleep,” said the lead author Caleb Brown, a scholar of the Royal Tyrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
“He enters the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved copies of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.”
In studying his skin, researchers found that it was herbivorous, although it was covered with armor and resembled a walking tank, it appeared to have been severely endangered by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful dinosaur shell used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used protective equipment known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to merge more quickly with the environment and avoid encountering enemies, the experts say, suggesting that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This being, at 110 million years of age, belongs to the Nodosavre family, was widely featured in the press in May, and is now at an exhibition at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum lab of Mark Mitchell, one of the team members who spent more than 7,000 hours digging into it.
The remarkable preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the brushes and the tin plate on his body.
They discovered protective paint, a widespread method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective paint is well distributed, the opening has become unexpected because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than that of the currently living animals with a protective colour.
It may be assumed that the dinosaur was so actively hunted by the carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred the mask of confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern - day animals with protective colour — such as deer, zebras, or armoured animals — are much smaller and more accessible, indicating that the nodozaur had to struggle seriously for survival.
“The serious threat posed by predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur shell shows how dangerous the predatory Mel’s period was,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the cherry dinosaur also indicates that its skin should have been laminated brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the contents of its digestive tract, to find out that it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to sea, where he sank and his back down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans are likely to spread much farther into the land than it is now.
“This nodozave is truly remarkable because it will completely cover the preserved combed skin, and at the same time it has been completely preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original form of the animal”, Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did back then, in the early harvest period.
You don't have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just need to get a little snooping around, and you can almost believe it's sleeping."
It is an age when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his horrendous ancestors could hunt the tyreophorus.
These include an acrocantosaurus, a monster with a length of 38 feet (11.5 m) by weight of six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mummified.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working at Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the world's best preserved tyreophorus, along with leather and armor, and it is a target, from the face to the bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five metres) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
They were characterized by two 20-dimensible spikes from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous tyreophorus has been hard on what Canada is now, until a spilled river has taken it to the high seas.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his vest accurate to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the burgundy shells along the dinosaur’s skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, the degree of security “is rare as you win the lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the burgundy armory plates that pierce the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is pulled along the side, his five fingers are pointed up on it.
I can count the brushes on his soles."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, formerly head of Georgia and then Odessa Region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by the Polish Television Republic, which posted a video on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at the event in honour of the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Hitlerian troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to begin speaking the language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the Ukrainian Migration Service had deprived him of his citizenship was recognized by an all-inclusive politician in the United States.
How he was able to make a transatlantic flight without documents is yet to be known.
Former Governor of Odessa District, Mikhail Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any questionnaires.
Investigation period in Weinziher and Olhovik cases extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group "Renova" by Evgenia Olhovik and the head of the energy cylinder "T Plus" by Boris Weinzicher was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basmann Court considered extending the house arrest of accused persons.
The representative of the SC informed of the decision to extend the preliminary investigation for the last time.
“The individual complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to remove and carry out a large number of documents and to conduct investigations in the territory of several RF entities”, said the investigator.
He added that the suspects were regularly bribed to the leadership of Komi.
Their total size is estimated at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzicher, Olhovic, as well as former ZAO leader, Michael Slobwin, who, until 5 September, headed the Wympelek company, handed over bribes to the top officials of the Republic of Komi for establishing the most advantageous heat and electricity tariffs, as well as for creating an enabling business environment.
Weinziher and Olhovik were detained, taken to Siktivkar and arrested for two months, and Freedom was hidden from the investigation and declared in federal search.
How did one activist know the answer to the question, “Who are the streets?”
Brittany Ferrrell was shaken to the depths of the soul on 9 August 2014.
Just a day after arriving in New York City as part of a tourist tour of St. Louis's birth, she was sitting on a bed in an Airbnb apartment, looking at a Facebook tape on the phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "Police have just killed an 18-year-old, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Noticeing that no one else in her tape has ever posted this information, which is framed, she closed her Facebook and tweeted.
There were many user posts on her tape with @TheePharoah.
Reper from the Great Saint Louis in real time tweeted the death of Michael Brown, a unarmed black 18-year-old teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the street, where it will be located for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was not new to her and her circle.
She hung up on the phone, and then she came back to tweet that people were meeting on the Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of the signal tape and the screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father, who cried out, "The police officer from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a direct broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
On another video, another cop, she said, "I'm going to kill you all... animals!"
“It’s a non-standard situation”, according to her own memories, Ferrel said.
"It's not murder like the ones we're used to and we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a sense of virtue.
I was angry and I cried."
She took a ticket for a reverse flight and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they were both going to Ferguson the next morning.
What took place with Ferrell and Ferguson for almost three years became the theme of the new documentary “Whose Streets?”, which will be released on August 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and who have filled the streets with answers.
While Ferrell drove to Ferguson with a daughter dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of color, they recalled the conversation that had been having so many times before this morning, “about the experience of black people and their situation”.
She recalls, as she said: “Do you remember how I told you how black people had to struggle for what they believed?
We are now going to Ferguson because a police officer killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
"I couldn't take her," Ferrel said later.
"What's happening today is the culmination of what's happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and be trained on it.
It should not only be well understood in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of black people and their situation, and what we must do to be free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with a Wednesday where she won't personally face obvious racism, she's no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad service if I had kept her from doing so.”
When they arrived at Ferguson, the first stop they made on South Florissant Road, on a platform across the road from the police station, which became something like a tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of Officer Durren Wilson's final defence.
Ferrel and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who made lunch packets.
They collected packages and helped to distribute them to the protesters.
At least in his mind, Ferrell took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that she had been a student of the University of Missouri-Saint-Louis, who had been the president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and had been engaged in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I haven’t had the organizer’s experience.
This has come upon itself.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell introduced Saba Folayan, one of her associates, to the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her main operator, Lucas Alvarado Ferrer, “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrell came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story you can play?"
This skepticism was hailed by many people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and perseverance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not the focus of attention, and wanted to do so otherwise.”
By that time, Folayan had joined forces with his associate, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the death penalty.
Its participation sparked a sympathy for the Ferrel project and for the six more local residents with whom the “Whose Streets?” project team maintained contact over the years since Brown's murder.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or us, that’s what we are talking about,” Davis said.
“This was the most important thing for me as these people will be represented, because this is how I will be represented.”
Although the purpose of the project was not to focus on Ferrell's experience, in an attempt to show that the movement “is not about the leader-saviour, but about how the community is united”, according to Folayan, it was the most open of the film.
As a result, Ferrell’s personal aspects of life were unexpectedly revealed in Whose Streets? For example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing about the first time I saw a finished product.
“But I realized that when you do such a job and make black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrel's history again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Life movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- the ones who created the #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the murder of black teenager Trevon Martin in 2012 -- attributed themselves to homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership support this movement," Ferrell says. "That's because we're always fighting on several fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that “the movement is indeed supported by black women and by many gay black women”.
Nevertheless, it insists that “it is not a positive discrimination” and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
“She was the person who awakened this energy”, she said.
“ On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that it was first, because when ”
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, there are no cameras in Ferguson, but there are still complex racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be two and a half more years on probation to close the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called home, simply “Bardak”.
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she came out on Ferguson Street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualify U.S. players
El Salvadoran footballers Henry Romero and Darwin Serena have received long disqualifications for undisputed conduct.
During the fourth final match of the Golden Cup of the North and Central American and Caribbean Confederations (CONKAKAF), Salvadorans bitten American players.
The first was Henry Romero's defense attorney.
El Salvador bit Josie Altidor's assailant, then pinched his chest.
Then a half-protector, Seren, put the coal in a fine square, bit U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Serena was disqualified for six.
The meeting ended with a 2-0 victory for the Americans, delivered to Goal.com.
Origin of similarity: artist creates portraits using DNA by Chelsea Manning
At the centre of the Hall at the Freeman Gallery in New York, people's faces are hanging from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all incomprehensiblely similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by Hiser Dewey-Harborg, a painter of brush strokes and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst spends 35 years for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called "The Origin of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harbor, whose art combines technology, information and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama softened his sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
Having analysed the Manning DNA software, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people who might be with such a genome, Dewey Harbor has created a deep, although it is not easy to perceive manifests about not only the plasticity of DNA data, the different ways of interpreting them and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also the notion of identity.
Manning, born with Bradley Edward, but from adolescence she openly said that she believed herself to be a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Law on Spying, Computer Fraud and Fraud.
Her photographs in prison were inaccessible, so only one of her pictures was known: a grainy black and white selfie, where Manning in a platinum wig, clearly feeling awkward, sitting behind the wheel of a car; with this photograph she was associated with.
In 2015, Dewey Harbor successfully completed its 2012 project “The visions of strangers”.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people by means of forensic evidence of the type of vortices and chewing rubber, extracting DNA from it and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey Hagborg explained at the preliminary show of the new press exhibit.
At that time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her sitting in a museum prison became friends in correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of the "Depressed Images", illustrated by Shawla Kanungo, who depicted how in the future the president would ease Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was released proved to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something profound and powerful and that the exhibition is opening right now that Donald Trump is declaring war on people who reveal secret information in the government, and he is inventing new ways to fuel the hatred he is supposed to ease in Twitter.
When Dewey Harbor was asked to match this in time, she said, "Nothing happened."
In a statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's huge signature on the bottom (with a heart instead of a "i" in her name) calls for an end to the "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar from the carandas C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotide, as a scientific artist), Dewey Harborg hoped to show how oddly we all look, in any case by our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open the genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harbor; her 2007 video work "False Memories" is also displayed here.
"The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibit in one room is the above-mentioned novel in comic books.
It features King-Kong Manning over the building of the U.S. Correctional barracks with a loudspeaker in hand.
"If they kill your speech, they'll win," it says.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says the artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still have skin ants when I talk about it."
Manning had not seen the exhibit in person - as it was transparently depicted in comic books - but when she arrived, she would be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genome simulations gathered together like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as is the case at the exhibition up to 5'2nd height of Manning, on which genetic haplogroups have been drawn.
"I'd rather hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a bunch of people," Dewey Harbor said about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her release."
Professor, University of North West and Oxford University staff are searching the police for murder charges.
According to the police, there is a nationwide raid on Professor Northwest University and a staff member of Oxford University, who are wanted as suspects because the luxury number in Chicago found a man killed in a riot.
According to the Cook District Court's records, orders were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to be released on bail of 40-year-old Vindem Latham and fifty-sixth-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell Duránlo.
According to the documents, the 20-year-old Cornelius Duránlo died after multiple stab wounds.
The Chicago Police Department's prevention indicates that the body was found on 27 July.
A police call came in, they came into the Grand Plaza complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell Durantlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and the detectives are now investigating the death of the knife wounds, considering it to be a murder, while the police are intensifying their search for two suspects.
Latham held the position of associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to go to campus at the University of North-West.
“Now it is a criminal case investigated by the authorized persons, and the North-West University cooperates with the investigation,” Kabaj said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at the University of Oxford.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have communicated with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to US investigative bodies”.
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Chief Anthony Gulelli said that he strongly advised suspects to surrender.
“The police have suspected their whereabouts, but our efforts to find them are intensifying”, said Gulemy.
According to Gulelma, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Gulelmi, police officers have been called by the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who has just received a covert report that something happened in number 1008.
The police called the scene a terrible crime scene.
Gulemí reported that it was unclear whether the incident itself had occurred on 27 July.
According to him, the video camera records confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were linked”, said Gulemy.
The Grand Plaza Manual issued a petition to the residents, which reported: “At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic accident”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: “We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map shortly”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) set to resume the work of the Russian Anti-doping Agency (ROSADA) would be met shortly.
“The specified stage in the execution of the claims has been completed, and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct the tests jointly with UKAD (the British Anti-Dumping Agency).
The WADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map on restoring compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of the work of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"All has been announced, all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly," he added.
However, one of the requirements on the list implies that the Russian Andeping Structures should publicly recognize the results of the investigation commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which alleged that doping in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
On this point, Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no programmes, and we will not admit what was not."
Vitalia Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission, repeated his words.
On the morning of that same day, in an interview with Russia's Russian edition "Rsport" Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept the report," Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from the Doping Control in November 2015 following the Doping Scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, WADA Director-General Olivia Niggli stated that RUSADA was “going in the right direction” to restore its work.
Wildfire in a 79-storey tower in Dubai
The large fire that took place in one of the tallest living buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, smothered, conveys Reuters.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to deal with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 msk).
Local authorities reported that no one had been injured as a result of the incident.
During the fires that were next to the skyscraper, the streets were shut down.
The reasons for what happened were not yet known.
It was previously reported that the 79-storey living skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is on fire in Dubai.
All the residents were evacuated on time.
The unthinkable bulwark of the bows: the pants that do not cover their shorts
The scandalous reality show "Dom-2" by Olga Bouzova has struck the audiences of the Europa Plus Live Dance Festival in the Trousses.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, a new singer with Nasty Kudra played the song "We'll Be Hot".
Both girls went to the stage in provocative "brucks", sewn in such a way that the lower white singers appeared to be visible.
Buzov and Kudry were written on their pants.
It was previously reported that changes in the appearance of Bouzova had been commented by a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic.
Stoltenberg acknowledges the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
This was reported by Radio 4 on Friday, 4 August, with reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN Gensek, NATO also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia was, however, possible, and that further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, President Donald Trump of the United States said that relations between the United States and Russia were at a dangerous low level and accused the US Congress of doing so.
Ekaterinburg Metro takes a new way of paying
In October, a visit to the Ekaterinburg Metropolitane could be paid by bank card, said CEO of OAO "I-Network" Paul Wedernikov in an interview with the District Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce the same system as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want the refugees from other countries, the mondial guests, to be able to use the metropolisan with their bank cards, without buying tokens or standing in line”, he said.
The startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among her staff in the field of electronic commerce, but no interviews were conducted.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, sincere.
Even though she had promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He was never consistent and objective,” said Errett, manager of a 75-person company in San Francisco, Madison Reed, responsible for electronic hair-care trade.
She therefore turned to others for help.
There is now a new type of start-ups in the field of staff that help companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure the involvement of staff, they allow companies to express themselves, to apply for specific commands and demographic groups, to offer anonymousness and hotlines for complaints to staff, and in some cases to allow informers to pass the top management and direct direct contact.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Burnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used to measure staff involvement.
Errett explained that she had reached a greater understanding of what her staff thought and felt in terms of three years' use of Glint.
In addition to express interviews and questionnaires of specific commands, the product offers a company's heat map and shows in visual form, which units have more complaints and which managers have low ratings, allowing it to understand why.
Companies are less aware of the need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become the next Uber, who was involved in the scandal when a former staff member posted a post on a blog that described the aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups such as Glint, this is a desire to control the situation, an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let’s talk about pay”, dedicated to financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Convercent launch from Denver, Colorado, to help companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the backdrop of Uber reputation.
Overcent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individual staff interviews, collect confidential real-time responses, and browse the heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the office.
“The court of public opinion has taken over the power of the inspectors”, said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company does not treat staff properly or behaves unethically, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may suffer costly consequences from boycotts by clients, staff drains and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where more than 25,000 employees work in 500 facilities, has been using theovercent for over a year to make sure that staff are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to contact the company's main office.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a telephone number or e-mail at the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that they would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday legal office, who said that there was no normal way to monitor staff complaints.
Now, when the company is using the Convercent service, the problems previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, disorder and unfair pay – can be quickly discovered and taken care of.
“I can draw closer to a comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff,” said Vitrano, who manages the risk management team of the Ruby Tuesday network.
“And we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings against staff”.
According to Quinland, companies began to deal more seriously with the ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after Arthur Andersen, an accountant, suffered a collapse due to ethical violations resulting from Dela Enron.
But only when “social networks have received massive distribution” have companies realized that they will not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral distribution on the network.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy”, he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a regular fee from companies for their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in the company's total capital of $60 million.
These investments are unlikely to be surprising if they take into account the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
Growing research shows that today's staff expect more from their jobs than before.
In highly competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just a minimum.
Staff want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to the company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they are heard, and that the work they are doing results, they are trying more to make such a company a success”, says Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Satisfaction at LinkedIn, where Convercent and Glint are being used.
Investors receive income when companies from their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the dedication and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
It is important, as culture professionals say, that data on employee involvement are available.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
Indeed, if the company requests feedback, it may give the impression that there are changes.
And if change doesn't happen fast enough, or if it doesn't come up at all, frustration may develop, and staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you should be ready to hold 4,000 interviews”, said Russell Rat, President of Management Consulting Kotter International, who had to see companies making a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will say, "Have you really heard me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff interviews, is able to take action on the same day as someone reporting the problem with Glint.
And, after feedback from staff members, dissatisfied with decision-making and communication quality, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new knowledge of its staff and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it to retain staff more effectively in an industry known for its high turnover.
“If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people”, said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is opened on Krasnoarmey Avenue
In Barnaul, crucial measures have been taken to address the cause of asphalt failures in the Krasnoarmey Avenue.
The place where there were two pits on a recently paved carriageway (crossing with Youth Street) was decided to open.
Remember, a small section of the road near the tramways occurred due to the ground crossing in the unexploded area of the unexploded network.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the Urban Committee on Road Management, Upgrading, Transport and Communications, Ivan Garmat will conduct a detailed survey for a detailed survey and the elimination of predispositions to corruption.
Depending on its outcome, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that it will be necessary to restore and stamp off unmanned communications.
This is reported on the official website of the country capital.
Commande Bruins has to do longer because the National Student Sports Association has canceled training twice a day.
The time is approaching 11 p.m.; a bunch of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles, are being delayed to chat on one side of the new training fields of the camp team.
Some of them pulled off their shirts by stretching their backs from the sweat after the busy first day of the sports camp.
For many of the team's players, these minutes of idleness are a midday break.
After three hours of training, the players will go back to the dorms to prepare for the final exam and return to the Wasserman soccer center at 6:30 in the morning.
Shortly before Monday turned out to be Tuesday, Bruce Jim Mor's coach said, "In the next three days, these guys are waiting for a butcher."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the pressure on players, actually extended their working day — at least until the exams were completed on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles were assigned 7:15 a.m. to accommodate them in an already dense schedule of players.
The side effect of the lack of two trainings per day has been more than one training day, and Bruins is moving the camp to start for almost a week compared to last year and is training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of the Sea in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 exercises up to and including 20 August before starting formal preparations for the first game in the season against the team of the University of Texas A&M in September.
Mor said that he supported the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that he had made another point in the tight schedule of players.
"In three or four days, we give them this enormous burden, this is a serious test," said Maura.
"And they just got over it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and have more time, it will be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make training closed; this is an easy task, as its fields are in direct view with adjacent parking and adjacent Laskin Centre, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed by football balls that have crossed the security grid behind the gates.
The British players should take the hotel from this weekend, but Mora assumes that when the rooms are available during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security”, said Maura.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger of someone taking away a room, sitting there and recording training on video.
If you have a video of practice, it's very serious.
But we're going to have security in there, and we're going to have security in parking lot number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't be too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
All those affected by the attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals.
All those injured during the attack at St. Petersburg Metro in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Vice Governor Anna Mitjanina.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people left in the stations, transmitting the TV Centre.
Let's remind you that the St. Petersburg Metro-Politation Explosion overturned on 3 April this year.
A suicide bomb blew up Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the executioner himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall, on the eve of Roskobnodzor recommended that the metropolitan of St Petersburg review the road map for transport security, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against feicing news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mystifications to independent experts and show their conclusions under the original posts, declared on Thursday the largest social network of the world trying to fight so-called fae news.
In a statement on her website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible mystifications, send them to the check-up and possibly show the result of the pending fact.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways in which so-called feicing news has influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, according to many.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports to the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, before the September elections, they expressed support for the plan to fine social networks if they did not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate German statement, Facebook reported a test of a new chipping fact algorithm that had been launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what reports are challenged by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context in order to make informed judgements about what they are reading and what they are sharing”, wrote Sarah Sue, Link Manager of Facebook News.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of “related articles” and work on other changes in the news bar to solve the feicing problem.
Create a comic novel: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scottney's tiny castle was filmed in a music video called "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s, it served as a port for Margaret Tetcher.
But for 700 years since his cozy place in the Beul Valley in Kent County, he's been watching a stormy story around, and now he's inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a land of hair and a propensity to historical documents, a novel comic book.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personal when you hold this letter in your hand."
The castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells of families living in Scotty; each story was illustrated by one of the young British painters Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "Zobs of a Dead Man and Other Stories" -- a collection of British Library documents; the project suddenly touched him to the bottom of the soul.
"I could have been scratched by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written by a double agent working on jacobits in the 1700s," he says.
"It's a fingerprint of his finger."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days they lit a fire.
And 300 years later, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a person who is so passionate about the old paper, getting support from the National Fund and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months (“To be honest, I'm getting a little bit there”), it seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the “new” Victorian castle for days, walked through archives, and looked at numerous treasures of the property and old things - such as the heads of the hyenas on the walls or bottles, which have been in the cellar for centuries.
He walked through the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talking to the foresters, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night he "dried out whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotty's castle is not fully studied, because the National Fund was granted full access to it only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only just begun to deal with the archive, which he described as "the fact that the aristocrats had fallen on their heads for centuries".
The diaries, the writings of the British Empire's time, the maps showing who owned what he thought were boring land disputes, said Rhodes, but this is what two families fought for.
That's what happens, guys!"
In some of the history of the castle collection, it becomes a starting point for wider research in English history: for example, in Rabotnik, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Kreststan Revolution.
“There are reports of the rebellion that occurred in the castle in 1380, in the book entitled “Cent and Sassex Knights’ Families”, said Rhodes.
"The Crusade began in these places, and I thought that rebellion was a good start.
Were they bound?"
Other plots are closely related to the history of the castle, such as “Priest, ” which tells of a priest - Jesuit whose family Darrelov had been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or the Contrabandist, of 18th - century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who believed to have staged his own funeral by filling the grave with stones (it was discovered several years later when the tomb was dug).
Darrells, the beloved family of Rhodes, of all those who inhabited Scotty, said, "The gentlemen seemed to be a perfect fool, and they went into debt forever and spent money on what they couldn't afford.
For generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women -- I picture them as a company of nice guys who know how to take care of the heirs of great fortunes."
Once the work is completed, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to obtain unique writing experience.
He spent two weeks in a Finnish mouse where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamyanmiya, a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew again into the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life."
Fifteen of the largest banks choose “Russia”
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: followed by Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FK “Opening”, another seven credit organizations are planning to leave the public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be represented by emerging ARB organizations.
But it is not just an exit - all banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings together credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks “Russia”, led by a prominent politician, Anatolia Aksakov, chairman of the Financial Market Committee, recognized as having been the result of the last session and the most effective head of the thought committee and MP of the number of drafts prepared.
The start of the intra-ARB conflict was initiated during a discussion at the Council of the Federation, when new bills were being considered at the Interregional Banking Council, in particular, involving a new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, President of ARB, stated that the bill was considered by the association to be adopted in favour of the largest banks, which thus tried to limit the ability of small and medium-sized banks in the regions to intercept their customers.
Other claims included criticism against the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunjana, did not always rightly withdraw licenses from some banks, which, indeed, was objected by the representative of the CB: many leaders of banks that were lost, such as the Ex-prompter, were members of the ARB governing bodies.
This exchange of mutually exclusive views in a highly sensitive relationship with the central regulator of the banking environment, which seemed to be a visible reason for fifteen of the largest banks to disagree with the ARB policy, began to prepare for the entry into Russia Association, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB would be at a low level and constructive dialogue within the banking community was not actually taking place”.
The tabloids will be better.
What's the end of this?
We will answer immediately the main question that arises in or around the banking conflict or conflict: the depositors are not at risk, but rather the reliability of the banking system will be improved.
Leads Rossia Anatolia Aksakov, known for his touchiness in all the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional whose value is high in the Central Bank: almost all CB management is present at annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator take place through expert assessments of the “regions”.
There are apparently no special shocks in the human resources plan.
Without a doubt, the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after such powerful and influential participants have been deprived of their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in 1991, this senior institution, a banking community-led organization, has considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary treatment in general.
It cannot be said that the Russian Association with its wide embrace is ready to accept new members under any conditions, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Aksakova ("maybe too much to want"), who, on 21 July, in a briefing at the Parliamentary Gazette Press Centre, said that “literally on the next day, representatives of emerging banks asked me to consider increasing the potential of our association “Russia”.
Their proposals are to increase the voice of bankers in the Council of Association and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is under way, the proposals of the two parties are being examined, the agenda for an extraordinary meeting of the association to be held in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of an international banking forum is being prepared.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Anatolia Aksakov also emphasized that “it was not held behind the chair” as a possible new leader of the updated association “Russia” by Georgi Luntowski, who left the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, with a high profile of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatolia Aksakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to stop his leave and come to Moscow for one day, for an extraordinary meeting of the Russian Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the extraordinary convention “Russia”.
The entry of petrol engines into major cities of Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of the Mintrans Nikolai Asaul stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-engined vehicles into major cities of Russia would not be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept of gradually increasing the environmental class.
And there's the concept of moving right to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
It's the same at the level of slogans. Let's not.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
We're gonna shut the whole town down?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe that's what's going to happen," says Prime Minister.
In the past, News reported that by 17 August, Arcadia Dvorkovic, Vice-Prime Minister, had been tasked with examining the proposals for possible options for the head of electrical transport submitted to the Government by PAO CEO Kamaz Sergey Kogoginim.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, are the use of cars with the VAT system in major cities and resorts.
D.C. is changing the rules of obtaining the Grencart.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan would be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining the Grencart would be amended.
The plan is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, to stricter rules for obtaining temporary working visas and to restrict the granting of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two Houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so in terms of changing the way that the United States gives green paper to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give the advantage to English-owned candidates, have the money that allows them to maintain themselves and have the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to the American media.
Sex workers are real, and we should be worried about that.
We failed to think that 2017 could no longer be worse, a new report on technological success in the production of sex workers came out.
Yeah.
Sex workers are now the focus of attention.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex workers in the next five to 10 years.
In the opinion of Noel Sharka, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and the founder of the FRR, we have to take them seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of robot eyes, the form of sauces, and the type of nail.
"People are wobbly about this, but firms are already sending them to a lot of consumers, and we'll see a lot more of them soon," Sharky said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable gatherers into silicone - leather robots, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "adapt" their robots according to their taste, selecting everything from the colour of the eyes and the form of the sauces of the work to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality”, compared to which the Stepford Woman would appear to be very progressive, is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to set up quality robots that they find attractive - for example, shadyness.
There are other sex workers, Roxxxy Gold, developed by True Companion, who are delivered with an already programmed individuality - such as the Cold Farra, is an impression of a blindness, and the Dekay Wendy is a brave character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits yours nicely," says True Companion.
Therefore, she loves what you love, does not love what you do not love, and so forth.
She's having a change of mood during the day, like a real person!
She can sleep or chat, or she can "be in the mood"!"
The emergence of sex workers is a matter of great concern, not least because they replace real human relationships, but the most concerned is the subordinate image of a woman, the rape association that causes the control of the cold (read: resisting) Farah.
The "True Companion" Roxxxy's website compares to the vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) has a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" said the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a deviation from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sexual subjection as an option.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex workers, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain on the sidelines of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery may be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither stupid nor aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complicated sex workers showed up at a time when women's rights around the world were threatened when there was a president in the White House who boasted about what was going on with women.
The worst thing in the show is "Raskaz Servants" -- not graphic images, twisted bodies, and embroidered eyes -- that is, how realistic the vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem that big.
The goal of the sex worker industry is to achieve the physical likeness of real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look human to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's their "character" robots that don't look like real women.
They can't break up with or leave their partners.
They have neither their life nor their biography, anything that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy an illusion of full dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
The L.A.J. (Pooh) Jeter, who has been in charge of the gathering of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which will start on 31 August.
In an interview with BeBasket, Andrey Lebedev, the general manager of the Blue Yellow Channel, reported this.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come under family circumstances.
We're going to the Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I would like to remind you that with the direct participation of Jeter, the collecting Ukraine took its record sixth place on the Eurobasket 2013 and first hit the world basketball championship, where the yellow and blue failed to overcome the group phase, while the US harvester recruited 15.4 points on average, made 3 selections and gave 5 gears.
Jether has ceased to speak for the gathered Ukraine since his departure from the position of head coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
Men's Eurobasket-2017 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold its team tournament match on Earth promised.
The Eugenia Murzin Trusts in Group B will have five individuals: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3 September), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men ' s team conducted two control units to the Dutch and Belarusians.
A great feat of Trump?
To portray myself as Mita Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trampa era, political disputes that polarized the American electorate were common in the microlevels of some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers peed columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all just so tense, we're gonna snap.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, my left-wing poet from Chicago, who was long on knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against the common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trampe in the White House, all she knows, including the Republican brother with whom she had been arguing about politics for decades, were suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is certainly good at dinner; but I can't help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
The Trump blew the force into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trampa and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we're gonna stop beating him to death.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who will suddenly be a model of common sense in the light of his standards.
I realized that I really miss the old-fashioned insanity of Mitta Romney, with my dog on the roof of the car and a 14 per cent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) - compared to Tramp and both, it seems very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went to Central Park with the kids, the biggest car in the New York Park Department, and the best way to spend three dollars in town, if you don't need caffeine.
The badgers are ugly and huge, the pictures of the glass on the central drum, the gremishing clowns and the animals, who, in the horror of looking at their backs, are extremely creepy, and the sounding music, as strange as it may be, is a thrill.
So many well - known things in this city are disappointing: species of skyscrapers are outdated, silhouettes of buildings have gone too far to cause distress, and the reality of the city is not going to succeed behind a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day I found out that the Suisse-Kottage area is not actually a Swiss scarf (the Ye Old Swiss Cottage theme pub) but a big crossover in North London.
And the car in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two years, a child of eleven, and two women in forty can spend an excellent time.
If I could do a score, I'd do a five, but fortunately, no one asked me to.
And at the university this week, I was asked to take a quick look at my "experiment" on a scale of one to five stars.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus option to make a 15 per cent score of tea is to order a stand-up.
As a result, not only is neutral interaction slowed down, but it also has to be personalized in a situation that does not prejudge it.
The poor saleswoman at the university smiled completely while I was getting tired of my experience of handing her a credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
Pistorius leaves prison because of his visit to a doctor for the second time.
Last year he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder following an appeal from the Public Prosecutor ' s Office for an initial conviction for an unintentional murder.
He killed Steenkamp early in the morning on Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting several shots at her through the bathroom door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his girlfriend as a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor's Office has announced its intention to protest again, this time against the six-year term of the Pretorius, which, she said, is too soft.
The Attorney General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be considered this year.
The period of Pretoria may increase by 15 years if the Office of the Public Prosecutor succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
NTV journalist suspected of beating up a non-refoulement subscription
Capital law enforcement has opted for a restraining order in the form of a non-departure note for a man who attacked a journalist on NTV TV Nikitu Razhazjaev during a live air from Goriko Park on 2 August.
This is reported by ATS with reference to an official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Irina Volk.
“As part of an investigation into a criminal case initiated under article 116 of the Criminal Code (“Poboi”) against a 32-year-old man who struck the face of a television channel in the Central Park of Culture and the recreation of the name Goricki, the suspect was selected as a preventive measure in the form of a non-refoulement subscription and proper behaviour”, Volk said.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for non-compliance with the police had been established for the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during a live air to the VAT day, a careless man came to the correspondent and hit the face.
As it turned out later, the hoodlum had nothing to do with VAT.
According to Razjeev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the mosquich.
Two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking, according to BBC Ti-Vi TV channel.
In the morning of 1 August, a group of people were detained in Sitonia, including two Bulgarian citizens, who placed tents in an undeterred location.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation was still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed BBC that Bulgarians had then been released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and have already imposed serious fines on anyone caught while parking in an unforeseeable place.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the US Vice President of rhetoric of the cold war
Statements made during the US Vice President's European Tour by Michael Penz were criticized by the Russian MIDA.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly moving towards the primitive ideologies of the cold war, which have been completely removed from reality”, says a statement by the Russian foreign policy agency.
Thus, in the Midwest, Pens responded to the words of the “Russian threat” and to attempts to force the border crossings they had been told in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out the destructiveness of the choice of either "or with the West or with Russia" and the lack of visibility of the idea of the alleged non-alternative accession of all South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the US that had violated international law by applying force to remove Kosovo from Serbia and thereby creating another hotbed of tension.
“We call on American colleagues to stop the blackmail of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual consideration of the interests”, says the statement by the Russian MIDA.
Feldscher was hit by a crash accident in Podmoskovye.
The accident occurred in Stupino's wetlands, resulting in a collision of the innomy with the ambulance "Score Aid" hit the Feldsher.
Today around 08:10 msk was hit by a Mitsubishi car with a ambulance in the town of Stupino Moscow district.
“As a result of the crash, the ambulance turned over”, stated TSS in the press service of the GU MUD in Moscow.
On the ground, the law enforcement officers are working, and the circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
In Odessa district, a woman threw her newborn son into a cellophane package.
On the evening of 3 August, a package with a baby was sent to the Division of Police from the locals.
“At the scene, law enforcement officers and doctors who quickly brought the child to medical facilities” reported to the Odessa chapter of the National Police.
The medical authorities determined that the boy was born a few hours before his detection, as evidenced by the presence of a umbilical cord.
In the course of the priority follow-up activities, the birthplace was identified as a 36-year-old local resident.
It has also been established that a woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter on law enforcement, the family had not previously been involved and had not been specifically taken into account.
The circumstances and reasons offered to the woman to do so by the police are now being identified and a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman in Nikolaywa threw her undernourished child into a garbage can.
Gregory Lepps: "I'm going to fight, although 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian squadron Gregory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday on Sunday.
Before the ceremony, the singer communicated with the columnist.
I remember what your "poltnik" said.
Special Tent in Liars, Gloria Gainor sang for an anointing, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
I'm sure you were faking it like you wanted to spend your next five years.
Is that what's going on?
Speaking of professions, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, drove around the country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
I've released two good albums.
Of course, now I'm not what we're gonna say 20 years ago.
Biological times don't lie.
Sing like I sang in my 30s is getting tougher.
But I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, and I think I'm going to a different level.
You write a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it now.
In fact, we've already recorded it in my studio and now we're sending it to Los Angeles.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" in a one-name song that was written together with Timothy.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't taught her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we take it off.
Let's introduce the album to a series of my jubilee concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall in November.
A great American drummer, Chris Coleman, put his hand in your new plate.
Do you think you wanted to bring him into your cooking class?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most remarkable drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a known drummer involved in various projects. - News) offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they've been making, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from €35,000 to €45,000 a month.
Then I thought in the postSoviet space I'd find the decent musicians.
And he found a great drummer named Max Malishev.
It is better to feed your own.
At times, I want to fuck one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is high at the international level.
Western music magazines are written about and invited to various guitar festivals.
After listening to his game, Steve Wei said that "a new generation of guitarists, with another performer's technique, came."
Your album goes down in Los Angeles, American musicians work with you, but you still can't come to the United States alone?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers involved in this matter.
As a musician, I'm truly sorry that I can't get to America.
I've told you a lot of times I'm learning there.
The more you communicate with the real professionals, the more useful it is.
We don't dull them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been faced with the challenges that American musicians have always faced.
They sought as much quality as possible.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me entry for ten years.
But I'm still going to put the visa papers to the British Embassy every year so I can go back there and work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favourably.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a commission, but an official, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, and I've been there once.
Now they've reinvited, and, as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert have been sold out.
You're going to "Randev Lama Wykule" that starts on July 20 at Jurmal?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a beautiful woman who knows how to put herself and her beautiful vocal cords, and even her whisper.
After the party and the jubilee concerts, as far as I know, any time you want to go to Vladimir Vysoski's work.
You already have two albums with his songs.
When's the third coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to record some 80-90 songs of Vysocka in the same feed as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangements.
I'll be accompanied by our famous musician, Timur Vedernikov.
I'll try to get Alexander Jakovlevich Rosenbawma involved in the album.
I talked to him about it, we had a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what happens.
You and the songs of Boris Grebntech gradually entered your repertoire.
Why don't you write it down later?
Boris Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a wonderful musician.
I ran into him a couple of times and said, "Can I sing a song of his?"
He said, "Grigory, I'm writing songs to perform."
Please, try, sing.
It's probably interesting to have a record like that.
So far, I don't have that task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovitch doesn't object, I might be able to do a project like this.
If you don't focus entirely on the works of your producer center.
I suppose, until you realized his potential, you haven't signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would have hoped to have under my wing, but they're self-sufficient, self-contained people.
You mean Sergey Lazarus?
Serja is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his development strategy.
And now there's Alexander Panayotov in my center, who I used to run in Voice.
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be truly regrettable if he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, take the clips off.
I hope it's a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks get into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still lead our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a record album on the way out, a few clips.
Then, if they will, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money they have invested in them.
Although it would be a pleasure for me to have one of them make a business success and pay me the percentages we agreed on in the contract.
But if this doesn't happen, I'm not going to turn the oxygen around.
Let everyone work, break through, prove what I once proved.
If you're offered to go to Ukraine tomorrow, and you're guaranteed to enter the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited.
These are mainly closed activities.
As for the grand tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian man, in my own conviction, flew to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If tomorrow they say we have to go to some other point in the interest of the State, I'll take my time.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have achieved this situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and must be together.
I'm sorry that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 to 50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists he collaborated with Annie Laurak, St. Loboa, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, the mass of gifted people, and it is a sincere regret that they cannot now fully tap their talent into a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some cool Ukrainian executive to Russia, like Slavu Vakarczuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But at this point, I think it's unlikely...
Andrea Ohlopkova was transferred from space.
As the "U" has become known, technical director of the cosmodrome of East Andrey Ohlopkov has started work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HKNPC) called Krunicheva.
He had previously been engaged in the construction of an East Cosmodrome, but because of disagreement with the management of the Land and Space Infrastructure Centre (CENCI), he had been transferred to an enterprise in Moscow-based Fils, where the coordination of production would take place.
Mr. Ohlopkov will not have a substitute: the technical director's post is likely to be abolished and the function is disbanded by CENKI units.
That the Technical Director of the East and the Deputy CEO of CENCI for Technology Development, Andrey Ohlopkov, had moved to Hrunicheva, HNPC, and the "E" reported to the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as a government staff member.
"He's been working on a new post for several weeks," said the interviewers "U" in the industry.
The CENCI operational comment was not available on Thursday and Mr Ohlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information "U" was formally confirmed in the HNPC.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, stated at the company. - Andrey Ohlopkov had fully fulfilled his task of providing a trigger minimum for the first launch on the cosmodrome East.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to CENCI in 2013, with the support of the space forces, particularly Baykonur, and in Plesetsek, he served as the first deputy commander of the colonel's title.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a criminal figureer.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, regional merchants were charged with rejecting the government but failed to comply with the obligations undertaken to clean up parts of the vehicles in the Archangelian region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities in CENCI were extended to various projects, but the main part of them was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
The then Head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostupenko, in an interview "U" explicitly stated that the situation in the East "was critical already in October 2013".
The point is that a strategic error was made in planning: the first start of the Union-2.1 missile was planned for the same time at the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and the deadline was set from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, it had to be crafted: CENCI specialists began to operate parallel installation of technological equipment at poorly constructed facilities.
Andrey Ohlopkov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks that existed and the transfer that had taken place (in place of December 2015 Soyuz left only on 28 April 2016), the idea justified itself, says the source "U" at the cosmodrome: "If we hadn't yet implemented any of the Eastern deserts, we'd be engaged in the construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is involved in the creation of the cosmodrome, called in a joke Andrei Ohlopkov his “space Susan”, but he almost always asked for information on the progress of the construction.
He remembered Mr. Ohlopkow and the bluntness: for example, in the interview "U" he proposed that the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spetsstroy) be removed from the status of the sole executive on the East and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we all put eggs in one basket of the Special Service?"
This idea was found to be supportive of the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the contractor-general to complete construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex for the fourth quarter of the launch.
According to "U", the reason for Mr. Ohlopkov's transition to a new place of work was disagreement with the CENCI leadership on how to complete the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as working methods with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be best for all," said one of the top managers involved in the East Building.
A government officer, in turn, calls the decision strange: “He was one of the best professionals to find him an equivalent replacement will not be easy.”
According to "U", this would not be necessary: the position of the Technical Director of the Cosmodrome would be abolished and its functions would be disbanded by TECI units.
Music schools will have a two-student curriculum
In the future, children's music schools will be able to receive two courses simultaneously.
According to the director of the Ministry of Science and Education, St. St. St. Dolubenko is able to reread disciplines for students, and the second-grade question is to be addressed through special grants, referred to as RIA Novosti.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we will work with the expert community to develop a mechanism that will allow two fields of expertise to be pursued, but at the same time will not conflict with existing legislation in the field of education”, said Golubenko.
On the last Friday during the Nedet talk, Vladimir Putin, with the children's centre's students Sirius, said that she had to pay for recurrent items in the second profession at the Moscow Conservatory at the IMS.
The girl told me that she studied in violin and piano classes, and she had awards for both courses.
The Head of State recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian took to the skyscraper
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian Kiril N., who climbs the roof of the building on the wall, reports El Universal.
The incident took place in Mexico City.
A young man, using two unknown men, went through a three-meter fence into the territory of the Nestle office building complex and himself went to one of its towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man was arrested on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security sent him to the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
They find out whether a young man is legally present in the country.
Meanwhile, the video of a young man climbing high has become popular in the Network.
The users called the young man a spider man.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolates can help to facilitate the HPC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your food tract.
But recent studies suggest otherwise: diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help to alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, leads to the size and swelling of the abdomen, chronic or blood vessels, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually to relieve the symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at Washington University found that the primary amino acid protein triptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, a leading researcher, explained that the immune cells in the intestines ensure that harmful microbes that come with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much inflammation, it may lead to inflammation of the intestine.
Experts have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in their intestines have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs triptophan -- one of the building blocks of protein -- to start the formation of these cells.
Professor Kolonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuterium - which is part of the normal microbiom of the intestine and the development of cell populations that increase tolerance.
The more Triptophane was contained in the feeding of mice, the more they had these immune cells.”
He suggested that the same would work for people: a combination of L. reuter and a rich triptophan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation of the environment in the intestine.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganzas, who studied the variety of immune cell tolerances, found that one group of tested mice had these cells, and another group, which belonged to the same line, but was kept separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbiomes of the mouse’s intestines, which are communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the stomach and intestine tract.
The DNA of the mouse intestine cells was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found to be present in mice with immune cells but not in mice without them.
The mice that were grown in a sterile environment without a good microbiome and which did not develop this kind of immune cell received L. reuterium, and the immune cells appeared to them.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuterium in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of liquid - without bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells that are selected from mice.
Immun cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a by-product of triptophan processing, known as indole-3-molic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same increased tolerance cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteriums in their gastric tract.
It is not known whether by-products of the L. reuterium by-products of the development of cells in humans, just as in mice, but in people with inflammatory bowel diseases, there have been defects in the genes associated with the triptophane.
She said: “Perhaps the development of these cells must be strengthened, as these cells are dependent on inflammation processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of tryptophan with L. reuterium may potentially lead to an increase in their population.”
According to José Maureen, Manchester United hired a genius in the face of Nemaji Matić
Manchester United hired a genius in the face of Nemanji Matić, according to José Maureen after a half-protector debuted in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The game, purchased for £40 million at Chelsea, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last United Nations pre-season match in front of the UEFA SuperCube against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression on the part of a half-protector, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke in front of the UEFA SuperCube against Real Madrid on Thursday, while they would be blessed.
Nevertheless, as Matić did not take part in the Chelsea pre-season tour of Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Maureen, required further work before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius, how he thinks – he thinks about football,” he said to Maureen.
“We will help him to prepare sooner than late.”
Like Matić, his new players Victor Lindeloff and Romelu Lukaku started playing at the Abiwa Stadium when Maureen began forming his main composition by the start of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Maureen wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
“I thank the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
"I will be even more pleased if they get me four out of four, but they have already tried very hard for me."
Former Socialist Democratic leaders of Lithuania are urging them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-Prime Ministers Algirdas Butkjavicius and Gediminas Kirkkolas, as well as former Speaker of the Fair from Social Democrats, Czechoslovakia Yurschenas, appealed to one party to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the Parliamentary Gazette, due to the tensions with partners - the Alliance of peasants and greens - the Social Democratic Party has initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
Here are three senior experienced comrades who have written an open letter to one party, which states in particular: “The disappointment of the party's party partners is understandable, but the coalition with the “crests” has created for us, and not very easy, but the conditions for further pursuit of the goals of social justice, which we have set out in the Government's programme on our initiative, and for maintaining the political dominance of the left centre over the right parties.”
According to the former leaders of the party, the discussion had so far “expressed emotion-based expression without specific arguments”.
The authors of the letter fear that their party's reckless actions may lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anton Mamaev was sentenced to a fine.
Moshorsud softened the sentence of a wheelchair boy, Anton Mamova, from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubs.
Prior to that, the sentenced person was released from SIZO by a judgment of the Court of Timiraziv.
At the same time, Moshorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he had organized a robbery and abduction of the motorbike fighter from the former Special Forces.
Moshorsud, by his decision, softened the penalty for Anton Mamaev to a fine of 200,000 rubs.
“Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, he must be held criminally responsible”, explained Moshorsud Spokesman Ulyan Solopov.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Momev, the factual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which penalties could be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamova Vasilya Serostanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would justify changing the severity of the sentence and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamoev himself said that he remained dissatisfied with the Moshorsud decision.
I'm disappointed in the court decision.
The only legitimate solution would be justification, the intention to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not rule out an appeal against a conviction before the Moshorsud Court of Cassation and the Supreme Court of Justice.
“We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights”, he said, “RIA Novosti”.
Remember, Anton Mamova, a 28-year-old Moscow with a spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
The disabled claims to have bought a biker from acquaintances for 160,000 rubs to sell.
However, the owners of the motorbike, including the former special forces fighter, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vassili Serostanov, had taken property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timirozova District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasilija Serostanov to three years' imprisonment and Anton Mamova to four and a half years ' imprisonment and imprisonment in the general regime colony (p.2 of Art.
Following the placement of a disabled person in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Office of the Attorney General of Human Rights of President Tatiyan Moskalkova, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamoev was released from SIZO by a decision of the same Timiraziev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed against the decision of first instance in Moshorsud.
UNF to prepare an environmental report to the President
The Final Forum of Action of the Pan-Russian People's Front (ONF) will focus on environmental issues in 2017, informs the News of the source at the UNF and confirms the Chief of the Alkey Anisim movement.
He said that, as a result of the forum, the "frontists" were planning to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the domestic environment and to propose a strategy for their solution.
Interviewers at the UNF note that the report to the Head of State will contain a “deep analysis” on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to News, the UNF outcome forum will be held in autumn.
The exact date has not yet been determined - it is generally subject to a presidential schedule, which is the leader of the movement and traditionally is present at key UNF activities.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts, in Rostov-na-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan Ude.
On the basis of the proposals made and will be made at these events, we will draw up systemic proposals to address environmental problems, as explained by the interviewer at the UNF.
The Co-Chair of the Olga Timofiev Central Movement Headquarters, head of the Committee of the State on Environment and Environmental Protection, reported that “frontists” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Environmental Year in Russia.
The resulting environmental forum and the “Food of Action” of the UNF is likely to be combined.
Over the course of the year, we have grown up as a strong team of experts in the field of environmental problems, we have seen gaps in legislation, we have stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report that we are preparing for the President as leader of our movement.
In addition, “frontiers” are also reported on the work on priority projects of the UNF, as told by Olga Timofiev.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would also be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the work of the UNF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is start environmental mechanisms to keep them working for years.
In order to avoid these issues, Olga Timofiev added.
Andrey Koladin, head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted that, in raising environmental concerns, the UNF operates under the presidential agenda.
Many things were proposed by experts in various forums, and these initiatives were supported by the President, said Andrey Koladin's News.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded so far, which could give regions additional impetus to development.
In the future, with the help of UNF, the regions will be able to deepen not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about a garbage dump in Balashe (always closed) and about coal dust at the port of Naodka (a bill on the prohibition of open coal transshipment in human settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timofiev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for dealing with environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is further enforcement practices, as well as civil society positions.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is considered by the head of the Ecology for All charity, Leonid Bochin.
Member of the SHR, head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergey Tsyplenkov, in conversation with the News, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business, some legislative effort, was needed to address environmental problems successfully.
As soon as society and business realize that addressing environmental problems is a much more beneficial step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change,” said Sergei Tsiplenkov.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the tendency that environmental law was an economic advantage for the business.
A British inventor used a microchip to get into a house and a car on the back of his hand.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip set up so that he could open the door of his home, go into the office, and even drive the car with a simple arm-span.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northham used a tiny chip between his thumbs and his index finger, and now, through BioTek, he offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Royal Winchester, to ensure that the ingestion procedure was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that uses cats and dogs, and the procedure only takes 30 seconds.
The company of Northema also replaces locks in houses and cars with a chip at a cost of £300 per castle.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his car BMW Z4, which is built when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House requisition cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the Time magazine, the White House decision last month to send a Marine Infantry helicopter to the South Lawn at an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One", when the president is on board, became the central element of the event in the White House on 17 July, which demonstrated the American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the White House senior officials reviewed technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was launched near a boat from the state of Man, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truckloader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Infantry Squadron (HMX-1), the Department responsible for helicopter management ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of “unusual” activities.
“I just wanted you to know that you know, because this is an unusually wide coverage of the press event”, said Commander HMX-1 in an electronic letter to his superior, the first Deputy Chief of Aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the gas station was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the time limits for work.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, while the unit security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by Time that the second crew had been required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has specified whether it is contrary to this decision.
“We asked, among other things, if this was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told not to,” the commander wrote.
“You seem to have nowhere to go”, replied the Deputy Chief.
The White House was declared an official event in America, and Hatcha's law did not apply to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
In the course of the event, the President made efforts to advance the health reform of the former Senate at the time, and praised attempts to regulate government decisions.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is unlikely to be new.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask them alone in the interest of photoopportunity.
Trump had already been the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane took a rearward course during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account collapsed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is excited about the show “Made in America”, which presented products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said White House Spokesperson Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and the South Lawn to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy up to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for the Americas event was counted as a required training flight per month.
The unit helicopters also flew 11 additional hours on that day as part of the “non-resident support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in the demonstration of the helicopter in the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent in the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence's hourly rates for 2017, the Ministry of Defence's reimbursement rate for VH-3D amounts to $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records indicate that the airtime of the aircraft was 30 minutes on each side of its airfield based on the Quantico Marine Infantry Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is far below that rate.
“It is completely wrong to calculate the cost for taxpayers based on an approximate rate of reimbursement”, said Walters.
“These sample rates include personal composition, services and many other irreversible costs, which are included in annual allocations”.
According to a study conducted by the RAND Corporation in 2015, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do indeed take into account the cost of fuel, services and costs indicated in the contract.
At that time, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spiser spoke in defence of the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to show this week the things that have been done in America”, said Spiser.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military technology that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
It is therefore, of course, absolutely appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter by inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he sat precisely in the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump approached the representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of products of the company.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the President. “I have three.”
Moscow will provide grants for urban hospital resuscitation offices
Every year, Lifesaving Grants will be provided to resuscitations and units of intensive treatment at the capital clinics.
The funds will be made to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, visited the Judin City Clinical Hospital.
During his examination of the clinic, he presented a thank-yous letter to the orthopaedic physician Viktor Prozko, who led the most complex surgery on the reconstruction of the adolescent foot.
Sergei Sobjanin also described the decision to allocate an intensive grant clinic annually to the resuscitations and units of intensive therapy.
The funds will be sent to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital master, the Judin clinical hospital is one of the largest in Moscow to date.
In recent years, new modern equipment has been introduced to the clinic to allow its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the University of Cologne.
Currently, the medical facilities have received more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the resuscitation and the station, there are day offices here.
The staff of the hospital numbered 2,800.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the medical agency became a participant in the short-stay pilot project (SKP).
They are designed to perform relatively small operations.
In the course of surgery, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the recovery time for patients.
After surgery at the station, they only spend a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were hospitalized in a hospital called Yudina.
Medical officers in the clinic performed 1,5800 surgeries of various degrees of complexity.
NBU reported that there were no buyers of Ukrainian daughter Sberbanka
In Nazbanka, Ukraine (NBU) reported no applications for purchase of Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbanka.
On Friday, 4 August, the TSS reported this with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017 a package of documents from the Belarusian and Cypriot nationals Viktor Prokopeni to agree on the acquisition of 100 per cent of shares of Sberbank withdrawn.
“No documents were received from other potential investors for the purchase of shares of Sberbank at the NBU”, said the communication.
On 3 August, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew the request for purchase of the daughter structure of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it became known that Natzbank of Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Sayid Gutzeriev and Gregory Guselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
The regulator reasoned that businessmen had not provided the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank reported on the sale of his Ukrainian “daughter” consortium Norvik Banka and the private Belarusian company in March this year.
The main shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev.
Sanctions against the “welcomes” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
They are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country for the benefit of mother organizations during the year.
Superintendent of the third season of Narco: in the popular series of the Netflix studio after Pablo Escobar's death, the cartel Kali plays a central role
Although the second season of Narko revealed the identity of the killer Pablo Escobara, the Netflix studio was a long way from completion.
The flow service had already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons were planned, and the third was already presented by the first trailer to demonstrate the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the drug control agency attracted the richest drug dealer organization, the Cali cartel.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, stated at the United Nations.
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, participate in them, and the head of the United Nations mission to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Heisoma, head of the UN Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the position of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated”, he said in his statement Wednesday.
The choice can only be fully representative if women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections for the provincial councils and the presidential election will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threatened to disrupt the electoral process, which coincided with the transition of international forces from military operations to the role of advisers.
In elections this year, power has for the first time moved peacefully from one democratically elected Government to another.
Haysom said that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice, fines were tightened for the ill-treatment of tourists
The Venice authorities have tightened the purchase fines in the canals from Euro50 to Euro500.
For walks around the city in a bathrobe or with an naked torso, they will now be fined for 200 euros.
A hundred euros will be required from those who make a picnic in the public place or ride a bicycle in the pedestrian areas, the TASS refers to the Russian Association of Tour Operators.
It is also mentioned that the authorities impose fines for inscriptions on monuments of 400 euros and for trash of 25 euros.
Tourists will be informed of the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice by means of a special company called "EnjoyRespectVenezia" (#EnjoyRespectVenzia) on social networks, as well as through announcements and posters on the City Council website, on billboards and in the highest settlement of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Tourism Adviser of Venice, Paola Mar, fines will be transferred to the embassies of the home countries of the violators to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach”, she noted.
In April, the Italian city administration reported plans to limit the traffic.
The number of tourists visiting the city centre is already well established in Venice.
Only 60,000 guests were allowed to attend the Festa del Redentore festival instead of 100,000 people.
In addition, a moratorium has been introduced on the establishment in the historic part of Venice of new fast-food hotels and restaurants.

SF liberated Ozerov from the post of Head of Committee
On Wednesday, the Council of the Federation endorsed the statement by the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Ozerov, and released him from his post.
He remains a senator from Khabarovy County.
The application for his release from the post of Ozerov was filed last week.
He explained his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to change the rhythm of life.
The senator also noted that the decision on care was not a seismic one.
Since 1996, Victor Ozerov has submitted to the SF RF a legislative assembly of the Khabarov Region.
The Senator ' s Defence and Security Committee has been in charge since 2001.
Electricity is cheap for both the inhabitants and the producers of Buratia
Over a decade of efforts by the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryat (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of electricity in low voltage for industrial customers has been reduced by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service, in accordance with the Russian Government's Decision on the amendment of the wholesale market for electricity and power and the consolidated forecasting balance of production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the Russian Single Energy System by entities of the Russian Federation (from 17.07.2017 to No. 842) established indicative electricity prices and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buratia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for stormy producers is reduced by a quarter, making life significantly easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the Republic's leaders have been encroaching on the thresholds of Moscow's Cabinets in vain attempts to equate the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk district of the Angar hydroelectric plants, a major watershed area for which Buratiya is a neighbour.
And only this year did the movement begin.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic fell from 4.24 rubs/kWh to 3.93 rubs/kWh or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Burundi by the Federal Government in the List of Market Price Zones for which the characteristics of wholesale and retail markets are established, industrial consumers have become quite different.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays a kilowatt/hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date for new tariff movements towards a downward trend for Burundi.
Scooter was not intimidated by the Ukrainian Attorney's Office and flew to Crimea.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Collegiate Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment of McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union requires guarantees from the managers of the cookie manufacturer McVitie's in connection with his long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The GMB Scottish office reports that the company has been silent about future investment on the tolcross site.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea factory, which produces more than 500 people, are working among other products.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years has invested more than £5 million in the facility.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the work of the facility, the staff and representatives of the trade union “know them first”.
In a letter to the head of a company-owned facility, the Scottish office of GMB called on McVitie's to respond to concerns that funding would not be allowed to upgrade production lines.
The Senior Organizer, Drew Daffi, stated: “Our trade union is deeply concerned that we cannot be clear from the Chief of the Business and Investment Plan on the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers in the local society and in the territory of the Great Glasgow; it is an essential pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline of production, East-And Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at the McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “the leader of the Tolkros site received only yesterday a letter from the Scottish GMB office, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the staff and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcrosse with the GMB staff and representatives, at which we discussed a number of issues openly.
We have spoken with the staff that, as all companies operating in the most competitive and volatile economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this concerns all of our facilities and activities - in order to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our tolcross facility, especially in production lines and improvements in functional indicators.”

Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supply to the Eastern Petroleum Company (WNHC) should be approached by Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one would give the instructions to Gazprom as well as Rosnefti.
Thus President Vladimir Putin of Russia responded to Igor Sechin's request to facilitate the resolution of conflicts.
The Head of State pointed out that the relationship between Rosneftou and Gazprom should be dealt with solely on the basis of market principles.
Igor Sechin, former head of Rosnefti, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on the gas for WNHC threatened the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gazprom suggests finding gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have that kind of resources," Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked her to use gas from the Gazprom of Cyrin, based on Sahalin’s shelf, for the Eastern Petroleum Company.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on this issue were continuing, and “no sharp angles there”.
Has Barcelon warned the SSW about the transition of Neymar three years ago?
A member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Parry Saint-Jerman won't stop stalking Neymar after the club offered £189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelone about the world record of the raid that took place three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when League 1 was ready to beat the world record at the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark on the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Naimar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as the PSC offers him a salary of over £500,000 a week.
It is known that Barcelona and the fury of the proposal, and how Naimar broke the contract despite the fact that the source, close to the management of the Catalan club, has always done everything possible for the player since he moved from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by President LAG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in hiring Blaze Matthews in 2014, Nasser Al-Khaleifi gave a strong warning to any club who would like to lure one of the best gamers of "PJ".
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’ll come out against them, we’ll offer them to the players,” Al-Khaleifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences."
It appears that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club expressed an interest in a semi-protective woman from the Polish Academy of Sciences, Marco Verratti, earlier this summer.
The SSW made it clear that it would not release an Italian team player under any conditions, and it is now likely that Barcelona is experiencing the consequences of its proposal in the form of losing one of its most valuable players, Naymara.
