Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear that they will be called muppets
This is the effect of the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (member of the Welsh Parliament, in the abbreviation of the MWP).
The idea was based on plans to change the meeting in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly on all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of kpin.
One of the Labour Party parliamentarians expressed concern about his group by saying that the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers from outside Wales: in Welsh the word “twp” means fool, and the word “pwp” means departures.
One party politician, Plaid Cymru, said that his group was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Wali Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to change the name. He noted, however, that the sound of the word "MWP" was very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter ‘in’ is spoken in a similar way to the letter ‘u’ in the English dialect Yorkshire.
As part of the committee meeting, which is currently working on a draft law amending the name, the committee took the following position: ‘The final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will be theirs.’
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposal. The change of the meeting in the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the assembly to the "Walian Parliament Member", i.e. the WMP in English, although this short "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
Members of the assembly are proposing alternative solutions, and the difficulties of reaching consensus are a tragedy for Elin Jones, president of the assembly, who should present the draft law in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules on the cancellation of members and the structure of the comitology system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their next title when discussing the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing country name
In the coming Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be named for the Republic of Macedonia.
The widespread vote is intended to help in the decades of the dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which the region called Macedonia is located.
The government in Athens has long argued that their northern neighbour's name constitutes a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia and the opponent of the referendum on change of name, said he disregarded the results of the vote.
However, plebiscite supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to enable you to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells at the New York Church of St. Marcin will be silent about the problems of the embarrassing churches in Harlem
"The older people I talk to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them at the moment."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Actually, people are social in a different way," he noted.
"Bars have ceased to be the venue for regular meetings of members of the community."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the funds from the sale of the property are not sufficient for as long as the decision-makers consider, and that “they will be at the starting point sooner or later”.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support other local temples.
As he said, “The overwhelming majority of those who buy homes in such buildings will be white, and this will accelerate the complete closing of churches, because it is unlikely that new people will be members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by an assembly of white believers before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the Church of St. Marcin joined the community a decade later).
The first assembly of white Methodists left the district in the 1930 ’ s.
At that time, the district assembly of African Americans took over the property right to the building.
The Church of St. Marcin was taken over by an assembly under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th street vendors (the main shopping street in Harlem), who opposed the employment or promotion of African Americans.
The fire of 1939 greatly damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and ordered the construction of a ring band.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Marcin's, proudly called the new Carillion "the poor's bells".
An expert who knocked out the bells in July described them in a different way as “cultural treasure” and“ an unreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first Carillion in the world to be supported by black music. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Marcin's Church had not replaced him.
In recent months, a number of complicated events involving architects and performers have occurred in St. Marcin’s Church, some of which have been brought to the scene by the church’s secular leaders, and some by the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of a parish made up of secular leaders) directed its concerns to diocese, claiming that it “wants to throw the cost of the council” even though the council did not take part in the employment of architects and contractors sent to the place.
Part of the parishioners also complain of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old scuba diver in search of lobsters in California.
The authorities reported that last Saturday the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old scuba diver in search of lobsters in California. The event occurred on the first day of the season on lobsters.
The attack took place just seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he dived with his friends when he heard a call for help. Immediately with a group of friends they sailed to the boy to help get him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first the boy seemed excited about catching a lobster, but soon he realized that the baby was shouting: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
After reaching the scene Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely broken skin around the collar.
"I started shouting at all to flee from the water, 'In the water there is a shark!' said Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's hospital of the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles' lifeguard said that the fish had already been observed a few weeks earlier. However, it was not considered to be a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper torso.
In order to investigate and for safety reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca for 48 hours until after Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles observed that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's store network plans to expand activities on the UK cosmetic market
Sainsbury's network throws gloves to shops such as Boots, Supercool and Debenhams, bringing cosmetics into its supermarkets that connect style to goods houses as well as specially trained vendors.
As part of a significant investment in the UK cosmetic market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly developing despite declines in the fashion industry and household products, 11 network stores will have bigger markets with cosmetic products. If the initiative succeeds next year, the activities will be expanded to further points.
The return to the cosmetics industry stems from the search for ways to own a space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network doubles the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 articles. For the first time, products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweizerman and Dr. PawPaw will appear in the range.
Currently sold articles L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space and separate areas close to these famous even from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its product range for Boutique makeup. From now on, most articles will be friendly to vegans, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first one opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second one in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops makes supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, President of Sainsbury's, said that sales points will increasingly resemble commodity houses because the network is trying to fight discounts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's placed Argos network points in hundreds of stores and introduced a number of Habitat network points since the takeover of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing the sale of food products and increasing the return on investment.
The previous attempt to reorganise compartments with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals resulted in failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's set up a joint venture company with Boots to try. However, cooperation was concluded following a conflict over the distribution of income from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, worth 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to Lloyds' reports, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing an extended offer of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and character of cosmetics departments to improve customer sensitivity.
We invested in special training for colleagues to help consumers buy.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to draw the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question existing ways of making purchases."
Peter Jones "worse" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' TV show, was "frustful" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was planning to withdraw from the $11 million lifestyle brand to focus on new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household articles called Truly.
The activities were often compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
A sudden decision to leave a well-promising lifestyle brand and focus on newly established collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV, taken by Holly Willoughby, angered Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Day program.
According to sources, Peter Jones was “enraged” when a popular television present announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts up to £1.5 million, there would be no time to devote to their brand offering accessories and household articles.
The company had previously been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop. It also had to double Holly Willoughby's assets estimated at £11 million.
After the announcement of Truly's decision to leave the brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left Great Britain to go to one of his summer homes.
The source reports: “Mark Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She had her future with her, and she wanted to take care of her for decades to come.
The decision to withdraw from the activity completely surprised all the persons involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, and it was so close to entering the market.
In the Marlow warehouse, the goods are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of this Morning and one of the biggest success stars in the UK can cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including articles from pillows by candles and household articles – and will lead to a further delay in entering the market.
It can also mean the end of long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded the Truly brand in 2016, and Peter Jones, 52, joined them in March as president.
Couples spent vacations together, and Jones covered 40% of the shares in a television company belonging to Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is supposed to be M&S's ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebryta program at the ITV station.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business."
Hard conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked about media criticisms caused by the comments made, which some considered to be a “disadvantaged husband” as well as a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a funny voice, pretending to be a television present:
"I didn't give up anything."
The president pointed out that Kim Jong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are lagging behind.
After more than three months from the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a “analogical response” from the United States at the early actions of North Korea to disarm.
He noted that instead the United States maintained sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We planned a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have great relations."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Unem had brought positive results: they led to the completion of rocket tests, helped free the hostages and returned to the other US soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
"It is easy to act after the presidency. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to a crowded stadium we would have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered right in front of us.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed one of the islands by killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on Lombok Island, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of roof over the head by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support. The situation is therefore difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian town of Palu, it is not certain that international staff will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Natural Disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if aid from international organisations should be allowed.
Faced with constant shocks in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although shelters were built in the province of Aceh in the case of tsunamis, they are rare in the case of the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a siren warning against the tsunami in Palu – despite the warning issue – probably affected the number of fatalities.
Even under the most favourable conditions, travelling between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, seeks assistance for the victims of the earthquake to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds for roads and railways.
However, in the face of the next year's elections, the President's administration is struggling with a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure because of the prevailing religious tensions in the country, and members of the majority of the Muslim community took a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of residents lost their roof over their heads as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, arches, arrows, and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge wins the draw on the draw in the match from Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea in the English Premier League by winning a goal in the 89th minute of a Saturday match at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received an application from Xherdan Shaqi about 27 metres from Chelsea gate at 1:0 for the benefit of his team.
He transferred the ball to his left leg before firing a shot towards the remote gate.
The ball jumped high above the criminal field towards the upper right corner of the grid.
Then she came into the gate, flying over the throbbing Kepá Arrizabalaga.
"I was just trying to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to move it forward as far as possible. I wanted to give myself the best opportunity to shoot," Sturridge said in an interview for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I noticed Kanto coming, I took the ball and fired the shot without further thinking."
Chelsea was leading 1:0 in the middle of the match at the gate of the Belgian star Eden Hazard, who was shot at 25 minutes.
The Blue Attacker kicked the ball with a heel to Mateo Kovačicia and then ran towards the Leverpool.
Kovačić quickly accepted the application in the middle of the field.
He then performed a beautiful performance forward in the criminal field back to Hazard.
Hazard outstretched the defenders and left his foot towards the long pole of the arrow, which passed through Liverpool's goalkeeper, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet the Napoli Club in the group league of champions on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea is facing a video store in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
As reported by the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disasters on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in that country has increased to 832 people.
During the conference, the spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho announced that as a result of the Friday earthquake of 7.5 degrees on Richter scale, many people were trapped under the rubble. In addition, the earthquake caused a tsunami of 6 metres.
The city of Palu is inhabited by over 380,000 people and is full of broken buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman.
Following a woman's body found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside County, a murder investigation was initiated.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street Street.
Police are asking for contact from people in the area who have seen or heard any suspicious event.
Brian O'Hagan, Commissioner of the Investigation and Investigations Department, said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to call for contact with all people who were then living near John Street in Birkenhead who have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I also refer to all drivers, and in particular taxi drivers, whose registries may have established useful materials during the investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman had resided in Birkenhead and that her body had been found inside the property.
In the afternoon, those who claimed to know a woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
The police have informed us that he is in the process of informing the victim's family about the incident.
The taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get into the apartment building recently, but was informed by the police that access to the facility and leaving it is currently prohibited.
He fainted when he found out what happened.
The residents were told that they would not be able to return to their homes soon enough.
It was heard that one of the officers explained to the men that this area is currently considered a crime scene.
There was a woman crying at the scene.
She kept saying, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in the fenced area and another police vehicle was parked right next door.
Within the separated zone are officers guarding the residential building.
Persons with information are requested to contact Twitter (@MerPOLCC) or by telephone at 101, or by an anonymous application via Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111, indicating the event number 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's memorial to the British Parliament as the last victim in the dispute about "writing history again"
The removal of the monument would bring justice to the Taliban's resemblance to the destruction of many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "craziness" and "a new attempt to write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute over Oliver Cromwell’s character before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
The offensive activities during the English domestic wars were neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps his ancestor Thomas had been determined to punish the wrong Cromwell for his actions centuries earlier.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell on his monument shows how pleased this 19th - century politician was and that for many, it is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview for The Sunday Telegraph: “Through many persons, Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than today – as a defender of Parliament against external pressures.
The assessment of how appropriate this statement is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable form identifying one of the parties to the division.
His achievements as Lord of the Protector also deserve to be honored and remembered."
In China, a pig farmer’s deathous beating occurred.
According to the local media, there was a deadly attack on a farmer's pig in the Southwest of China.
On Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a broken artery near a barnyard in Liupanshui, in the province of Kuejczau.
Pig breeder is being prepared for vaccination in pigs on 30 May 2005, the city of Xining, in Qinghai Province (China).
According to reports, a man came to the market with his cousin from nearby Junnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found a man’s body and noticed an open door to a nearby barn.
He said there was a lot of blood on the rice in the bread.
The body section confirmed that it was nearly 250 kilograms of pig fatally pushed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and curving," said a man named Wu quoted by Guyang Evening News.
The surveillance footage shows that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
The sales manager said in an interview for Guyyang Evening News that at the time the evidence was collected by the police, the request was isolated in order to avoid another attack.
According to reports, men's family and trade authorities negotiate compensation for death.
There have been cases of pig attacks on humans before, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered fatal injuries.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, a nearly 300-pound pig was nailed by a farmer to a tractor, and the man's wife managed to drag the animal away.
After eating a farmer from Oregon by pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can release violent behavior in them.
"They just want to have fun.
They're like very touching babies... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The remains of Rosa’s hurricane will cause intense rainfall in the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa loses its strength by moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, there will be intense rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5: 00 p.m., Hurricane Rosa was given a category 1. It was then 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
According to the forecast, on Sunday, Rosa will move north.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form rather than heading east on the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will be approaching the peninsula of California in the form of a tropical storm, moving the mass of damp air into the north, to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in part of the territory of Mexico.
In the following days, the humid tropical air, which is in contact with the approaching rainstorm, will cause torrential rainfall in the Southwest of the United States.
In some places, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, pollution movements and possible droughts in desert areas.
The wet tropical air will rain somewhere from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour. This applies especially to parts of the areas of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is foreseen in some regions of the South West of the United States, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall, sudden floods and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of tropical rain risks, walking through the desert is strongly discouraged.
The rich rains can change canyons in the river’s edge, and storms with lightning will cause local stormy winds and dust movements.
The coming one will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of southern California.
Rain may be higher than 1.3 cm in total, which may cause small movements of pollution and road hazards.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
The tropical torrential rains will begin to approach Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, there will be more rainfall.
On Tuesday, the rich rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and will last until Wednesday.
In October, temperature fluctuations may occur with cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States. However, it will be warm in the inter-return zone.
This can lead to rapid changes in temperature at small distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
Between Kansas City ( Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska State) and between St. Louis ( Missouri State) and Des Moines ( Iowa State), these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, persistent summer temperatures may rise again.
In a large part of the Central and Eastern United States there is a warm start in October. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from southern part of the Great Plains to part of the North East.
Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term climate forecasts show a high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were watching Brett Kavanaugh's interrogations.
Over 20 million people were watching six television stations on Thursday’s hearing of a candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman who accuses a lawyer of sexual harassment during the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regularly broadcast programs to inform them of the sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the Senate court that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was holding her in a state of care and was trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that such a situation had not occurred.
It is possible that the fifth number of TVs was even higher than the number given by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC TV stations.
However, no figures were available for other stations including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Moreover, Nielsen is usually difficult to measure bystanders in the workplace.
The number given is similar to the viewing of the American football cup matches or the award award of the American Film Academy.
According to reports Nielsen Fox News Channel station, whose presentors strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest ratings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing.
Second place was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become the key character of Friday's events.
In the morning hours he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support the Kavanaugh nomination. On the video he yelled at demonstrators who had made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on the way to the hearing of the judicial commission.
Flake, with his head down for a few minutes, listened to unresponsive opinions. The whole event was broadcast by the CNN station.
"I stand here before you and ask you.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have the strength in the face of so many women'," you heard from a demoting woman.
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would confess during the hearing of the committee.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events awaiting the vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh in front of the entire Senate.
Flake said that he would only support the nomination when he knew the FBI would investigate the charges of the coming week, as the minority of Democrats insisted.
Flake was talked to part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Coons and a few other senators.
Flake's choice was important because the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
On Sunday's interview, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of Great Britain and undermining national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Birmingham Conservative Party (Great Britain) conference on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, theresa May on the front page was the Foreign Minister in her Government, Boris Johnson, attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, which would allow the United Kingdom and the EU to collect duties on their behalf, calling it “totally indescribable”.
Wade Sims' shooting: Police arrested Dityon Simpson suspected of murdering an LSU player.
Police arrested the suspect in connection with the deadly shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colors of the University of Louisiana (LSU).
According to reports, the Baton Rouge police command of 20-year-old Diteon Simpson has been detained and detained on second-degree charges.
The authorities have released the video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police have reported that during the fight Sims lost his glasses.
As reported by the WAFB-related CBS station, police officers found these glasses on the spot and found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
The police told us after Simpson got interrogated, he admitted to shooting Wayde.
According to the lawyer in custody, the amount of bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report, according to which a gunshot wound to the head and neck was caused by death.
The Police Command expressed its thanks to the Louisiana State Police Search Group, the State Criminal Police Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU Sports Director, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “work and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The man was raised in Baton Rouge at 198 cm. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season he recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "cut off" and "shuffled" by Wayde's death.
"It's one of the things we're always afraid of," said Will Wade.
Ash emitted by the volcano reaches the city of Mexico
The ash extracted from Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern outskirts of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to move closer to the volcano due to increased activity in the short term and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The Centre has experienced numerous strands and shocks.
The photos published in the social media show the front windows of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in the areas of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-degree earthquake, which visited Mexico in September 2017, geophysics have seen an increase in volcanic activity of 72 km south-east of the country’s capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has remained active since 1994.
Start of police with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of the start-up of demonstrators supporting Catalonia's independence with the preventive police forces. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extreme emotions referendum on Catalonia.
The group of masked segregators has thrown eggs and powder paint on police officers. The dark clouds of dust have usually flooded streets full of tourists.
It was also at the end of the day that the police used a stick to stop the fighting.
For several hours the independence groups chanted, "We do not forget, we do not forgive," while the opposers shouted, "Let Spain live."
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical assistance due to minor injuries sustained during protests.
After one year of the referendum on 1 October, the tension does not weaken, although the authorities in Madrid have found it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate the desired sessions of the Catalans.
The overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, however, the frequency was low due to the widespread boycott of the opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in violent riots with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, groups of people supporting the region's independence decided to prevent demonstrations supporting policemen.
The demonstration took place despite this, but the route was forced to change.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician involved with his wife in a separatist protest, said there was no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried out for joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck at a point without leaving," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections last December, the parties supporting the session of Catalonia have difficulty in continuing their actions. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting trial in connection with the role played in the referendum and the subsequent announcement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old phone recorder of a protest supporting the police, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute were inciting conflict.
"The situation is becoming more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced his desire to launch the next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"The election candidate for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested following several car hit in a house in Londonderry.
The event occurred in Ballenagard Crecent on Thursday around 19:30 British Time (BST).
Investigation and Investigation Commissioner Bob Blummings said the damage took the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car, a shot from the bush could also have been fired.
Mengi gate provides Livingstone victory over Rangers 1:0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought the team victory
Livingston played in the extra-clause of this season by setting the Rangers in stunning, giving Steven Gerrard a second defeat in his 18-game position as coach of the club from Ibrox Park.
Dolly Mengi's goal turned out to be a winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is in charge of this season without winning the Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will face the Hearts leader who loses eight points.
Earlier, as on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA European League games.
Livingstone has extended a series of victories in his division to six games. Coach Holt did not experience a failure to replace Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed a few opportunities against undisposed opponents.
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead a long time ago, as the band played the Rangers with a lot of problems.
First Scott Robinson got through the defense and shot the gate in the light, but he couldn't shoot the goal. Then Alan Lithgow didn't get hit after taking over Craig Halketta's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the gate, knowing that they could threaten the rivals during the permanent parts of the game.
And that's how the gate fell.
After the Rangers fired the Livingston free team, they found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created a situation for Menge, who got naked from the middle of the criminal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possession, but they couldn't force the hosts and they didn't cause any more trouble with Liam Kelly's goalkeeper.
Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's gate.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by the Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was unable to get into the light of the gate from another permanent passage sentenced to Livingston.
The Rangers continued their attacks in Livingstone's criminal field, but they could not use the situation. They demanded two criminal shots following Halketta's intervention against Glenn Middleton's shifter and one hand-playing. However, in both cases, the opponents' claims were rejected.
"Phenomenal" performance by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
A great performance and a result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great, once again beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost did not change from coming back to the extraclasse. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a perfectly organized defense. Menga, however, made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
While Gerrard is in charge of the game, they do not maintain their standards in this game.
Their game seemed to lack something: only once managed to break through the defense of the host. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to visit Erdogan in Cologne
During Saturday breakfast in Berlin (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of the upcoming controversy over President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which aimed to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences in human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Colony, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
This city has the largest number of Turks living outside their homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, a 25-thousand crowd gathered before the temple was blocked, but the president's supporters gathered around to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, including many Kurds, have also decided to express their opinion, condemning the policy of Turkey's leader and the decision of the German government to adopt policies in the country.
In contrast, protestors reflect the divisions raised by the hero’s visiting politician by part of the Turks living in Germany and considered an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist died as a result of car collision
The biker died after crashing his car in London.
The accident occurred near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, south-eastern city district, around 10:15 British time (BST).
After the accident, the driver stopped the vehicle and medical paramedics arrived at the scene, despite the intervention the man died at the scene of the accident.
Several months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist occurred on Childers Street (about a mile and a half away from the site of the Saturday accident).
Metropolital police have reported that officers are working to identify the deceased man and inform him of the family members' event.
Roads were closed and bus tours were arranged, and drivers were told to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penalty facility: six officers were injured as a result of riots
According to the authorities of the facility, six officers suffered injuries as a result of riots in a male penal facility with an increased level of safety.
The HMP Long Lartin penal facility in Worcestershire began on Sunday at around 9:30 British time (BST) and is still ongoing.
Eight prisoners in one of the wings of the plant were called on the special unit “Tornado”.
On-site officers have suffered minor injuries to the face.
The firm’s spokesman said: “HMP Long Lartin has been involved with specially trained personnel at the HMP Long Lartin penal facility.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We are convinced that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports, in June, the director of the establishment had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, prevention units were called to the plant for dangerous riots in which workers were attacked by billiard balls.
The sudden floods caused by Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial effect on dryland areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach Arizona, probably at the beginning of the next week. The remains of Rosa’s hurricane are moving through desert areas of the South West, threatening with sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of sudden floods on Monday and Tuesdays in West Arizona, south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, the rainfall will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed via Twitter that “from 1950 alone ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression within 320 km of Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached 65 km from the state of Arizona".
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 5 to 10 cm high. In some areas Mogollon Rome in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm high.
In the remaining desert areas of the South West, including the central mountains of Skalisty and the Grand Cotlin, the rainfall is likely to range from 2.5 to 5 cm and in some areas up to 10 cm.
People in areas threatened by the sudden floods that accompany Hurricane Rosa can be relieved because the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
While floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where drought is present.
According to the weather.com portal, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that almost 40% of the Arizona area is struggling with the touchy droughts of the second of the highest categories.
Hurricane Rosa will arrive first on the California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to travel with her hurricane force, reaching a speed of up to 137 km/h. She is now located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricane encounters the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing his weakness.
It's forecast to hit Mexico with tropical storm power on Monday afternoons or in the evenings.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a major flood risk.
The weather.com portal reported that “in the area between the California Peninsula and the north-west of Sonora, precipitation is expected to be 7 to 15 cm high, although they can reach 25 cm high”.
Then, Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico to the north in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning hours, she will reach the state of Arizona as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, she will wander into the southern state of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by the hurricane Rosa or its remains is the very heavy rainfall in the peninsula of California, in the northwest of Sonora state and in the Southwest desert areas of the United States,” says the National Hurricane Center.
Rain is forecast to cause life - threatening sudden floods and the movement of pollution in the desert and mud lava in the mountainous region.
An attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested in attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, about 4:00 British Time (BST).
The victim was transferred to a hospital and her condition remains "stable".
According to the Avon and Somerset police, one seventeen-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the area of Radstock.
Officers are asking to contact all persons with records of the event.
Trump said that Brett Kavanaugh "feeled angry" of the Democratic Party
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the absolute and outrageous conduct of the Democratic Party," said Trump at the age of Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "feeled insolent and angry" by the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the congress. He strongly and emotionally denied the charges of Christina Blasey Ford. A woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that that day “Americans could learn about the brilliance, class and courage of Kavanaugh.
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of the support of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, a lawyer of great merit for the community," he said in front of a crowd of supporters in the West Virginia century.
The President did not directly address the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the Republic's participation in half of the presidential elections.
"From the most important choices in our lives, we are divided into five weeks.
I do not start these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting to defend our great candidates."
Trump claims that the Democrats are pursuing a policy of "resisting and obstructing activities".
As one of the assistants of the important policy of the Republican Party said at the CNN station, the first key Senate vote on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed – many of which were abducted by high waves breaking up over the beaches – following a severe earthquake and tsunami that visited the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to participate in a festival in the town. At dusk on the shore, the waves hit as high as 6 meters high, killing many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the threat arose yesterday, the people on the beach did not escape immediately and fell victim to the tsunami”, said the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disasters of the BNPD at a conference in Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
"Tsunami attacked everything on its way, kidnapping cars, colds and houses," he told Nugroho. He added that before reaching the shoreline, the element moved at sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them saved themselves by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the Agency for Natural Disasters show many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and broken bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was haunted by second shocks.
A number of earthquakes have occurred in the area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT), the energy released by the extensive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could have had the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that hundreds of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He then added that the bodies of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
Nugroho said that fatalities and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake epicentre.
According to Nugro, the communication “has been completely paralyzed”, and there are no reports from the province of Donggal.
“Lives there over 300,000 people” can be read in a statement by the Red Cross. It has also been added that workers and volunteers of the organization go to places affected by the disaster.
"Now we can talk about tragedy, although the situation may be much worsened," the statement states.
On Saturday, the agency met with a general criticism due to the lack of information on the tsunami attack in Palu. However, the authorities said that the waves came right after the warning was issued.
An amateur video released in social media shows a man screaming from the building, trying to warn about the upcoming tsunami of people on the street.
Within minutes, the water wall crashed by the shore, taking down buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused significant shortages in electricity supply, preventing communication within the Palu. This, in turn, has made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still need food and other basic articles of the first need.
The airport in the city was opened only for humanitarian aid transport.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu.
More than 800 victims of the tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As Doseba T. Sinay, the National Director of World Vision, delivered the staff of this organization safely from the province of Donggala to Palu and found refuge in tents of emptiness placed in the courtyard of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some of the groups are slowly beginning to provide assistance, there are criticisms that workers from foreign humanitarian organisations with extensive experience are prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, acceptance of financing, resources and personnel from abroad can only begin after the disaster has been declared an area of national disaster.
It hasn't been done yet.
"We are officially still dealing with a regional disaster," said the spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government believes that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but this has not happened yet."
Two days after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing persons still hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canals.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who spent two days in the rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of Indonesian paralotic representation, trained two missing paralogues who took part in the Asian Games completed this month in Indonesia.
As Peter Mandaga said, other people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced paralotian, I am struggling with my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon Subandono explained how, within hours of the arrival of the community, Roa Roa Desperacko sent messages by the WhatsApp communicator to athletes taking part in the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of hooks in blue.
"I believe that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while completing cash at the ATM at the Newport on the Lefte shopping center
According to the Newport Police Command, on Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee, who added cash to the Newport on the Lefte commercial centre.
“The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to supplement the cash,” wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a published communication.
Another man "swept back to Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money from an ATM.
According to the report, witnesses saw a number of suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not report how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of the thief are asked to contact the police in Newport under number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Reporting his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote of himself: “A person previously known as Kanye West”.
He has been using the pseudonym Ye for 40 years. It is also the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change took place before a visit to Saturday Night Live. It is expected that during the performance, the artist will present his new album, "Yandhi".
He will replace Ariana Grande, a songwriter who, according to the creators, gave up “for emotional reasons”.
West stated earlier that the word "Ye" is not only short of his present artistic ancestry but rather of religious significance.
"I believe that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means "You"," West said in the previous period of the year, discussing the title of an album with a radio presenter about the pseudonym Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
First, I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – reflecting all of our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West was among other famous rapists who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West associate, also saved his pseudonym in various ways, with a connector, without a connector and with large letters.
The President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, undertakes not to use troops against civilians
Before the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of the demonstrations of students, the president of the elects of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), committed to never use troops against civilians.
On Saturday, on the square of Three Kultur López Obrador promised to “never use troops to reprimand the Mexican people”.
On 2 October 1968, the soldiers opened fires in the area towards a peaceful demonstration, killing even 300 people. The event occurred at a time when left-wing student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico, providing monthly financial assistance for students, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities to educate young people into criminal groups.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and an expert in artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple companies, together with China's increased activity in this area, the United States should double spending on SI research.
The comments made relate to the advertisements on artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, although the US does not have an official SI strategy.
In the past year, however, China presented its plan to be the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double budget for research on the SI should begin: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview this week, CNBC also said that doubling the funds could double the chances of a further breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpoints: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the president of Synovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most significant companies dealing with artificial intelligence in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked for Carnegie Mellon University on the creation of the SI system, which defeated the best American player in the game Otello. He then took the lead in Microsoft Research and was the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the success of earlier technological initiatives by the American government, e.g. organised by the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the Defence Area (DARPA) to compete for the most interesting projects of the robots. He also asked for the time limit for the next edition of the competition, because he thought it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that takes away the best representatives of academic environments, but corporations,” said Lee.
For a few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to develop the SI.
"I believe that persons with artificial intelligence who have obtained a doctor's degree should automatically accept the green card," he said.
In July 2017 the Chinese Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence for the next generation.
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a way similar to the American National Science Foundation and other government organisations that grant funds to American scientists.
In the previous period of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense has set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will engage partners from the world of industry and science. The White House has announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
This month, DARPA also informed the agency of the 2 billion USD transfer to the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation currently invests over $100 billion a year in research on SI.
At the same time, the American initiative to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would lead to a decades-old dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in the territory of Macedonia's historic province, claims that the northern neighbour's name is a claim to its territory, and has therefore pledged to join the country in the EU and NATO.
In June, however, the governments of both countries reached an agreement on the title, but the nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority living in Macedonia.
President Ivanov said he would not participate in the vote. The campaign encouraging boycott raised doubts as to whether the turnout would reach the minimum level of 50% required for a referendum as binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that it is worth paying the price to join Macedonia, one of the countries emerging after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to such organisations as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted in favour of the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us with greater security," said 79-year-old Olivia Georgijewski of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that it respects the results of the vote.
The name change requires two-thirds of the members of Parliament to be supported.
The State Election Commission informed that no unusual events had been reported within 13 hours.
However, the turnout at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016.
"I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanovski, an electorate from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica, and son Dusko gave their vote in a referendum on a change in the name of the country to open the way for NATO and European Union membership.
Before the Parliament building in Skopje 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set chairs in front of tents distributed by boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and EU membership, but we want to join these organisations with the head and not the back door," Kawardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO membership will bring Macedonia's needed investments, where unemployment rates are more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will advocate a change of name in the referendum because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that "yes" is a "recognition of our future".
In a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Public Research Institute, 30 to 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required attendance.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV TV, 57% of respondents are planning to vote in Sunday's referendum.
70% of respondents said they would support a name change.
In order for the vote to end successfully, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government's policy since last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City conquers the entire defense of Brighton and takes the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent to the home a defense of Brighton in Saturday's final 2-0 meeting for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The gate won by Aguera at 65 minutes seemed childishly easy.
The action began with the application in the middle of the field to the Argentine assailant.
The footballer passed three Brighton defense officers.
Then Aguero found himself among four Brighton players.
First he played one of them, then he crossed over the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English assailant immediately handed the ball back to Aguira in a criminal field that beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper I shot to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero is dealing with foot injury," said Manchester City Pep Guardiola, a journalist.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he got the gate at the time."
However, Sterling provided the blue first team leader in the Premier League.
The gate referred to here fell at 29 minutes.
In the action of this Aguero received a deep ball in half Brighton.
He sent a great pitch along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves by letting Sterling move to the far poles.
The attacker of Manchester City directed the ball to the net just before it got to the car.
Manchester City will meet with Hoffenheim during the UEFA Championships on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. The meeting will take place at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of winning Rockyes.
After losing the opportunity to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, it did not have to occur in the first stage.
However, the admiring Scherzer competition hopes to take place in a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies, if only the Rockies will stand a chance to perform in the play-off phase. Currently, the team has one victory more than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can at least count on a wild card if they win a Friday meeting against the Nationals with a score of 5:2. Still want to get their first title as division champion.
"Although we play 'nothing', at least we will go out on the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the appearance of the opponents will be at the highest level as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in this meeting."
Nationals have yet to announce a launching striker for Sunday's meeting, but the team is leaning towards the exhibition of Scherer in the first set.
This would be the thirty-fourth show by Scherer in the first composition. The leader took part in Thursday's dart training and hopes to take place on Sunday.
The team's right-wing fighter from Washington recorded the results 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated the regiments and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as judge of the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of the Republican participation in half of the presidential elections.
"In November, we put all the achievements that have been achieved.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we are divided into five weeks.
Even though I do not start, I remain very active. I constantly defend our wonderful candidates," he said.
He continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by any means possible, and they're mean and mean.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt to gain power and control.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of "resisting and obstructing activities".
"It has been very well seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil, malicious, unpleasant and untrue".
The president referred to the Senate Judicial Commission, calling for the name of the American senator from the Democratic Party, Dianne Feinstein, which met with a loud noise from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for leaking the document?
"Oh, I'm listening?
Her speech was fatal, and it was the worst speech of the body that I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to those who express their own opinions
When the activists of the Momentum in my party voted in favour of giving me a horny vote, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am a member of a group of Labour Members who have been told recently that they are not welcome and all because of expressing their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, met with similar treatment because she objected to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the application for harassment was based on the difference between me and Jeremy Corby.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, and, ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
On Friday's announcement of a meeting of parliamentarians of the Parti Labour District of Nottingham East reads: "We want meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years I served as a member of the Labour Party, most of the Friday afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked just like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings are different now. A long time has been forgotten about the promise of a "more warmer and gentler" policy, as long as it has ever been mentioned.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the Party's leadership.
It all began shortly after Jeremy Corbin’s position as president. My colleagues, who seemed to me to have similar views, began to expect me to change the direction and take positions I had previously disagreed with, dealing with such issues as national security or the EU single market.
After each public talk, regardless of content, I meet in social media with attacks calling for nominations, condemnation of centrism or abandonment of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are rather political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience daily sexist or racist treatment, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to a daily order of insulting others.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for a "vote of distrust" and any change in the rules of choice the world's view of a party is narrowed down.
In the last two years, I have been repeatedly suggested not to bend down and silence certain matters, and in that case, everything would be “in order”.
But that's not why I took on politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, which led to the collapse of my school class, I have been trying to take care of the better quality of public services for those in need – both as a local councillor and minister.
I've never covered up my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in the Nottingham East district knew my position and knew the differences with the party authorities.
I would like to say to those who have supported the Friday proposal that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the President of the Labour Committee in the face of the approaching Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services.
However, I am referring the most important message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be able to serve you. I promise that no threats to withdraw the nomination or the immediate political objectives will discourage me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr v. Melrose 38:17 – Unbeatable Ayr again top
Two late apps may have been somewhat depraved by the end result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved victory in this extremely interesting Scottish extraliga game.
The team ranks first in the table and remains the only unbeatable team.
At the end, this distinctive defense and better use of opportunities led the team of the economy to win. Coach Peter Murchie could have been satisfied with his care.
"So far, matches have been a challenge to us, but we are still unbeatable, so I am pleased," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: “We must pay tribute to Ayr’s players. They have taken advantage of the opportunities that are emerging from us. ”
Ayr went out to lead at 14 minutes after Grant Anderson's role and increased Frazier's climate. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes, who came to the band from Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an untapped chance of a promotion.
At the end of the first half, he first got an app, and then he took the chance to raise, getting the score of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose's second half started well, and Patrick Anderson's leverage, raised by Baggott, reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a prolonged suspension of the game due to the severe injury of Ruarith Knott. The leader was removed from the field on the litter. After the resumption, Ayr increased the lead after the addition of Stafford McDowall and the increase of Climate.
Furthermore, the team captain's duties to Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose again used its number: the application with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the fall of Climate without the ball. MacPherson gained an apparition on the back of the approaching defense.
Clemo took advantage of the opportunity to raise, and then again he was able to raise the result right after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught the shot from the penalty shot and allowed his wingman Gregor Henry to get a fifth application for the host.
The Star of Still Game starts a career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, a star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting to become a catering industry. It has recently been discovered that he has become the director of a company running restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor embodies the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC site. He performs and co-creates a series with his multi-year comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
Duet announced that the coming ninth season would be the last in the history of the series. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he was the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although informer Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in a "developing gastronomic industry" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: without access to the sea of Bolivia, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Marines patrol the vicinity of the military base in La Paz.
There are blue flags from the public buildings.
In the ports of Lake Titicaca Navy, the following motto can be seen in the Amazon: “The sea is ours under the law.
His recovery is our duty."
In the lack of access to the seas of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict about the resources of the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes may be the largest in a few decades, and Bolivia is awaiting judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October following a five-year trial.
“The activities of Bolivia are taking a turn. The inhabitants are unanimous, optimistic and count on a favourable verdict”, said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching together the International Court of Justice. They hope that the organization based in The Hague will recognise the claim of Bolivia and after decades of fruitless conversations Chile will have to enter into negotiations on granting an independent country access to the sea.
Eva Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is standing next year to the upcoming controversy of the struggle for re-election, also offers hope in Monday's ruling.
“ We’re very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts argue that the chances for Bolivia are small and that even a favourable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague does not have the power to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also warned that it would not affect the determination of any discussions.
According to Paz Zarat, a Chilean international law specialist, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the final arguments have been presented.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to distance the country from its destination for the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been dominated by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zarat.
The persistent rhetoric of Morales deprived the Chileans of any good will left them, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
In both countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree with the opinion that the court's decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring "an exceptional opportunity for Bolivia to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "the end of the 139-year period of disputes with the benefit of each other", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — was using the topic of access to the sea as an element of political play.
"It will never give up on the right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The ruling is a great opportunity to believe that we have to deal with the past."
The North Korean authorities claim that nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho of North Korea states that his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at the time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be at the brink of the resumption of a suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unem in Singapore.
Ri claims that the "freeze" is as if there was no lifting of the sanctions and opposition of the US to the declaration ending the Korean war ever put North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without Pjongjang taking concrete disarmament steps in advance.
Both Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump want another meeting.
There is, however, widespread scepticism about the fact that Pjongjang is seriously approaching the liquidation of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only measure guaranteeing security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows will announce the emergence of the newest line of great head coverings in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover up in front of the sun, we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the run a number of crazy, extra-dimensional headsets of their summer collection for 2019, which illuminated style during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the course.
Valentino’s outstanding work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered ring that poured on the heads of models.
Other extradimensional accessories included arbuses decorated with jewels, a wizard’s hat, and even ananases — but they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Brown also showed a number of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style more than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with tubes and glasses, and another looked like melted ice.
And if you don't want to fuck with the great fashion, you're lucky.
Style monitors predict that huge hats can go to clothing stores.
The nondimensional hats follow the “La Bomba, ” a straw hat with a width of 61 cm, which all wore — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this unusually impractical hat, which was poured through the social media, presented another great creation — a straw - bag almost as large as the model of the bathrobe.
The burnt orange bag of raffia, finished with raffia and wrapped with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacques La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
Luke Armitage, a stylist of stars, said FEMAIL: “I hope that large hats and beach bags will appear in shops next year — because the designer has managed to have such a big impact, it would be difficult not to use the demand for over-dimensional accessories.”
John Edward: linguistic skills necessary for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have continued to enjoy their scientific achievements — in 2018 they were able to boast of another excellent outcome of their exams, supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) of schools attended by more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, they seek the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career paths and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector able to develop and implement a curriculum adapted to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects for school choice.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in a language he understands, then it falls into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that the languages are the first in league rankings, with the highest in the case of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 schools in the Member States of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of pupils received higher grades A in Mandarin and 72 percent German students, 69 percent French students and 63 percent Spanish students were also rated A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as subjects for choice, is conducted in the same way as the teaching of STEM subjects (strict science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in teaching programmes in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) found that the lack of language skills was responsible for the problem of job vacancies by employers in 17%.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people to start a career.
These skills are needed in a globalised world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language knowledge,
Lifelong learning, such as learning a second language, will provide an enormous advantage in the future — regardless of the chosen career path.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adult British people, 75% of them could not speak the language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language whose percentage of those using them was two-digit, that is, 15%.
That is why investing in teaching foreign languages is so important to children today.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in its languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn the languages considered most important to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interest, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by a specialised teaching staff in this area.
Scottish schools are independent in creating a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to be successful — whatever the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages are still of key importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a large choice, diversity and level.
It's just the right thing to do.
John Edward, President Scottish Council of Independent Schools
The LeBron debut on the Lakers team Sunday in San Diego.
Fans wanting to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers were finally waiting.
Luke Walton, a Lakers coach, announced that LeBron James would play a Sunday pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
You don't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
A reporter for the Lakers team, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James is likely to play an incomplete number of minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers matches.
"At this stage of my career, I do not need to participate in pre-season matches to prepare," he said.
So election Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election events.
This is the first of the five election centuries that Trump planned for next week, with positions in his friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote confirming his decision to hold office in the Supreme Trump Court, he seeks to build support for the upcoming elections in the semi-monthly government because the Republicans may be threatened with losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is it going to be tonight, so the election Trump in West Virginia, and where will it be on the Internet?
So the election Trump in Wheeling, Western Virginia, will take place today at 7 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
So the election Trump in Western Virginia will be able to follow live via the Internet on YouTube.
Trump will probably comment on this week's hearings of a nominated Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour, as well as the Senate vote on the suspension of the election for a maximum period of one week, at the time of the FBI's investigation.
However, the main objective of this election series is to support the Republics facing the difficult November elections.
So President Trump's campaign with five villages next week aims to "mobilise volunteers and supporters to help the Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives" – Reuters.
"Congress control is such an important point in the President's timetable that as the campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible," said the spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to give his name — Reuters.
Today's election in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — twice in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican of Patrick Morrisey, who loses in polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in his surveys," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the spirit of the fight, hoping to win Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions the format foursome held Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
A shimmering propeller is a completely invented sport concept, but one in which players really believe, and already most in competitions like these.
So what's their spread at this point?
"They've run six points, and now they've only run four, so I think we've got a little momentum," said Jordan Spith.
Europe, of course, has four points, while there are twelve more to gain.
The Americans, Spieth says, however, feel the wind in sails and have decent patterns to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them could boast of getting three points out of four.
Spith is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
Shouts on the whole throat as a sign of excitement became louder during the course of his round, drowning the key putt and winning the game when he and Thomas won two holes in two blows.
His reflection on the earth, which gave them a victory with result of result 15, met with a similar cry — one that made it clear that the American team was still in play.
"It's enough to focus and worry about your own game," said Pete.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Pete and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
Strange but lovely couple of European teams won four out of four and she wasn't wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't count Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
The way in which they play and how their energy seems to flow to and from both the noisy crowd proves that they should be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could seal the potential victory of the European team at Le Golf National.
It'd be best if they played different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about winning the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, an early hero football when he and Alex Noren were paired up.
Bogey and two-step double on the Nine front dug out the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole that they would never get out of.
Sunday there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how a change of strategy may occur in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead in the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the US team has an incision to fight in which some, particularly in the United States, doubted.
Europe with results 10-6 includes the holding on the final day of Ryder Cup.
A Europe with a significant advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after winning with 10-6 Saturday football matches and foursome with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — assumed a series of two victories over the warring Tiger Woods, increasing its record at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in an effort to preserve the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the inhospitable American team in the morning fourball, winning a 3-1 series.
The United States has put up more resistance in the foursome format, winning two games, but could not make losses.
To preserve the trophy, Jim Furyk's team has to get eight points from the 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutist to score four points in a row, while together with Molinari (this team was named "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend) is only the second pair in Ryder Cup history, which won four points in four opening games.
After the crushing of Woods and Patrick Reed in the style of furball, they beat the pumped Woods and the American debutist Bryson Dechambaau, gaining an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who spent two Saturdays in a game, occasionally showed a gloss of genius, but lost 19 out of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, a non-participation in the morning furball format, returned to Henrik Stensone in the foursome format to defeat the result of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka — positions 1 and 3 respectively in the world ranking.
However, the European team did not all go after thinking about this pleasant, cold day in the field set out in the southwest of Paris.
The triple main winner of Jordan Spath and Justin Thomas set a reference point for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a strong 2&1 win over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4&3 score in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup had the team made a four-pronged loss, starting singles, even though Furyka's team would only have had enough remission to preserve the trophy.
However, taking the second place two days ago, Sunday's counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea is saying "firmly not" to unilateral disarmament without trust.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during a speech at the UN that the lack of lifting sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence in the United States of North Korea and there is no way that this country unilaterally renounces nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken up “significant means of goodwill” last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any concrete response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, our national security will not be guaranteed, and under such circumstances there will be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri reiterated the known North Korean complaints of Washington's reluctance to take a ‘stop’ approach to denuclearisation, under which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual action, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation, as in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the President-in-Office of the United States and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim Jong Un undertook to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised the security guarantees of the North Korean.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (summer 1950-1953), but the U.S. Mission announced that Pjongjang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also relied on calls to alleviate the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearisation in the first place" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective in a forced manner, even opposed to the signing of the "war end declaration", Ri said.
"The statement that sanctions can put us on our knees is a cold of people who act ignorantly towards us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of lifting sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Unem and Donald Trump, which the United States leader spoke of at the beginning of the week at the UN forum.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: “If a party to the issue of denuclearisation was South Korea, not the United States, then there was no such impassion in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
Mim this, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to last year when he said it during the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea missiles in the United States is inevitable after what Mr Evil President Trump (Pan the Evil President Trump) called Kim Jong Una 'rocket man' (a man rocketman) on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Forum Trump, which threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim Jong Una for his courage in taking steps for disarmament, but also said that much work was still needed, and said that until North Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had not set a time limit for it, saying: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council Forum that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must be continued and continued until we find a full, final and verified denuclearisation".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea, trying to stifle the financing of the Pjongjang nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly Forum and later said that he would visit Pjongjang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress had been made, and in a few hours North Korea condemned him for “putting on gangster demands”.
North Korea undertook this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it would dismantle the site of missile testing and the nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures”.
He said that Kim Jong Un had told him that the "appropriate measures" on which he cared were the security guarantees that Trump had committed in Singapore, and that steps should be taken to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students take the appropriate long rest course
The new Harvard University course this year has provided all students with more sleep, which was designed to combat the growing macho culture, which consists of learning by “all-night high-powered caffeine students”.
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basis for self-care.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that according to him is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to speak about the influence of sleep deprivation on science.
“After the speech, one girl approached me and said, ‘Why is this only said to me now that I’m in my last year of college?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, students are told how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in learning and sports and improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said that this course was decided to take place after it was found that students had suffered a serious lack of sleep within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of a room in a dorm room where students click cups of coffee, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports outcomes, as well as the importance of keeping sleep regular.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not bring about an immediate change in student behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as everyone has the right to know what the health effects of smoking are," added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride with “all-night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means an ever-increasing problem of sleeplessness.
Providing enough sleep with good quality should be a “secret weapon” of students fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even avoiding weight loss, as lack of sleep makes the brain go hungry, making the student constantly hungry,” he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, according to him, is to invite all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students set a reminder alarm when to go to sleep and when to get up and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lighting that can upset the daily rhythm and lead to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes care of Gerrard's team
The Rangers once again suffered in a fight to leave Livingston, when Dolly Menga led to the defeat of Steven Gerrard's disbanded team, scored 1-0.
The team from Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first victory from the 4-1 triumph recorded in February above St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerard for the second time in 18 matches, causing a difference of eight points for his team against the leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot naked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers didn't seem to be getting any better.
While the Rangers recorded a drop to the sixth place, Livingstone rose to the third — just behind the Hibernian with the loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may have another problem because of the need to guard the head of Calum Spence's judge after he was hit with an object thrown out of the room for guests.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the team, which allowed him to move ahead with Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, in turn, passed with the same 11th Livingstone, who took a point for the Hearts team last week, being an amazing way in which his well-trained team tormented each step of its opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but the Livingstone team did more with the ball when they already got it.
They should have scored a goal in just two minutes, when the first lay of the Mengo ball allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Next, Keaghan Jacobs directed a deep jump free to Captain Craig Halketta, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, who was playing in the defensive position, could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it looked like they had more hope than they believed in their game.
Alfredo Morelos surely believed that he had a 15-minute prison sentence before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless fell on each other, but Judge Steven Thomson expanded the Colombian claim.
The Rangers were only able to fire two customs shots in the first half, but there was an Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, barely worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While the scored goal by Livingston at 34 minutes opening the game could be contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they had made in gaining it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with a deep permanent piece of the game by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw a ball at Scott Robinson, who kept his peace, giving Menga a simple finish of action.
Gerrard did not take a break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent — this change almost immediately had an impact on the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it out of his position.
Livingstone team continued to involve the guests in the game exactly what they liked when Lithgow and Halket were doing long one after the other.
Holt's team may have been able to increase the lead in recent minutes, but McGregor stood up for Jacobs, and then Lithgow pulled the game off the corner.
The Rangers Reserve, Glenn Middleton, had once again hoped for a penalty strike when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson regained his sight.
Almanac: inventor of Geiger counter
And now the page from our issue “Sunday Morning” Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's numerator has become both a science and a pop culture, for example in the 1950 Bells of Coronado, where you appear unlikely to be the cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you'll hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: “Now there is something coming!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survived until today.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” enemy cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify enemies of cells as part of treatment.
This method consists of separating immune cells from the patient and transforming them into a laboratory.
Then they can “see” the protein common to many cancers. Then they are reinjected into the body.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of tumours.
In one woman treated with a vaccine, an enemy immune system was diagnosed with an ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate immune cells from the patient, transform them into a laboratory, so that they can ‘recognise’ the protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then reinject the patient with these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very well-fed.”
HER2 “powers the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast cancer, ovary, lung and colon, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and to ‘teaching’ their tumour cell location has worked to treat some form of leukaemia.
Kanye West goes to the pro-trump diatribe in the Saturday Night Live program, with the MAGA hat on its head.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was "crashed" in a studio during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and said he would apply for office in 2020.
After performing that night of his third song, titled Ghost Town, during which he had a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he carried out a motion against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Although I speak to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's racist!"
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission on sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the West video was sent to social media by Chris Rock's comedian.
We don't know if Rock wanted to laugh at West, putting on a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had trouble with his hat.
"They followed me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're looking at me!
And then they say I don't have a way out," he said, " Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You say I don’t have a way out?” adding, “I’m going to put on a “pierererina superman, so that you won’t be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Let's accept it."
His words twice sparked the public’s “waves, ” and SNL members looked troubled, reports Varieta, a person who was in the studio during these events: “In the studio there was a grave silence. ”
West was invited to the program in lieu of the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many by the performance of the song I Love it in changing the bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest: Thank you for coming to the MAFIA.”
Leading a talk show by Karen Hunter on her Twitter, she said that West simply "was himself and is absolutely wonderful".
"However, I will NOT reward a person (by buying her music or clothes or supporting her “art of art), who I think accepts and spreads a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
So are we free," she added.
Before the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that now "the formal name is Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — followed by Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to the symbol, and then the artist known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder for knife stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
This incident took place in Ballyhackamore, as the police report.
The defendant is scheduled to appear before a court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecution.
The Star Game of Kit Harington moves the question of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval series of HBO “Gra o Throne” stations.
31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of the hero macho, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think they have to play tough guys to be respected.
In interviewing Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the toxic manhood problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the game plan of the throne, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he was feeling "almost certain", moving the issue.
"I personally feel pretty sure at this moment -- where did we make a mistake in the subject of masculinity?" he said.
"What did we teach men during their growing up, looking from the perspective of the problem we are currently facing?"
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculine can be partly responsible for television because of the presentation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate, and what attitudes are taught?
What do young boys learn on television and on the streets, making them feel that they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change it?
You can clearly see that everything is not right with young men."
In his interview, he also admitted that he would no longer play in any prequel or trinity game after the end of the series next year, saying that he had “ended with the fields of battle and horses”.
From November, Kit will be playing "True West" by Sam Shepard, who is a story about film producers and their brother, a thief.
The actor recently found that he considered his wife Rose to be the best thing that ever happened to him in the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the plan, which gave me my future family and a new life," he said.
In this award-winning Emmy’s fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, an object of loving interest played by Kita, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected, as health workers in the country report.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which means a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Compared to one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people in the LGBT community is widespread.
Based on the country's conservative values, research estimates that 70% to 90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission result from insufficient protection during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ensured universal access to medicines for HIV as part of its efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters objects to the fact that one of the members of her team discloses the data of the Republican Senators — “hazardous lies” and“the conspiracy theory”.
A member of the United States Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday as if a member of her team had posted personal data to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party has ensured that these accusations have been dropped by experts and websites associated with "ultural wings".
"False, lies and even more vile lies," Waters reported on Twitter..
The published information was similar to the home addresses and telephone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person on the Chapter during a panel hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against a nominated Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the Cavanaugh candidacy was challenged by three senators.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters office and published information about a member of the Waters team — as Hill reports.
"This groundless charge is completely false and is a hundred per cent lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were violated as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations — was not in any way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless charge is totally false and it's a hundred percent lie."
Waters quickly criticized the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, the former White House press spokesman.
"This is the wrong way to deny it," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he can't be mad.
He can't provoke.
He cannot question the motives of the person who makes the charges.
For that he must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to criticizing the Democrats at Judge Kavanaugh's address, who was accused of manifesting excessive anger during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's a rough case if it's true," he wrote on Tweeter.
In her statement Waters said that her office had informed "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent accusations".
“The complainants will be exposed and held accountable for all their activities which constitute a threat to any of my team members”, she said.
Johnny English Film Review: Nokaut — a spy parody with a weakened Rowan Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in any new film with a British thread has already become a standard. This seems to apply to the new part of the series of action films and comedy "Johnny English", which began in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the cinema screens in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Is self-smileing satire about how hopeless we are going to become the new export product of the country?
In any case, the eternally surprised, characterized by a rubber face, Johnny English has again been licensed as partisan — his name and name more than anything else indicates that he is an expanded, comical design designed for non - English - speaking viewers.
He is, of course, a silly secret agent, who despite his strange likeness to smoothie glamour has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a jasius Fasoli pinch and a drop from this guy adding one note to the melody of Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world secret man — Atkinson played in the previously forgotten TV commercials Barclaycard, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English series, there is one or two minutes worth of attention.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically struck by rotor blades.
On the screen, you can clearly see Atkinson's gift to physically play comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially since now also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Imposible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be addressed to children rather than adults — I think Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as creative and coherent as the gagi in his films of Atkinson about Jasiu Fasoli.
From always the current assumption is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
Cyberhaker crosses the British super secret network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents working in the field — to the shock of a service agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the darkened prime minister's charm, which is a pompatic, wasted figure already suffering from a breakdown due to a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power by encroaching on the character of Theresa May, but the scenario does not give her the opportunity to develop wings.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means poor Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school that teaches unofficial lessons about how to become a secret agent, a couple of good gags while giving English spying lessons.
English is called to Whitehall for a check-up, reconnecting with its former Bough assistant, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with a submarine master — a cheerful but a somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin's party at Her Majesty's secret service are back in action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, the character played by Olga Krylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously dominated by a charismatic billionaire technological mania who claims he can solve the computer problems of Great Britain — he's the one who hunts Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their cruise with absurd situations: dressed as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; they enter chaos by crossing the luxury Volta yacht; and English sows desolation when using a virtual reality kit to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
In this last sequence, all restrictions are disappearing, but despite a nice and loud performance, the whole film is very much like television for children.
Typical diameter.
Like other Johnny English movies, I couldn't resist the thought: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really corresponds to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it has developed a plan which provides for a four-day working week for the British, for which they will be paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary in five days.
It is similar to the fact that the heads of the company want to provide workers with the savings resulting from a revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) development, giving them an additional day off.
As a result, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, earning the same amount of remuneration.
The sources say that this idea will be "submitted" in the economic agenda of the party and plans of the country of departure against the workers.
The transition to a four-week work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way to use workers to change the economy.
An elderly member of the Labour Party, in a conversation with The Sunday Times, said: "It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year."
"It will not happen from day to day, but the four-week work week is something that is included in the party's approach to restoring the economic balance to the benefit of the employee, as well as to the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party committed itself to introducing a four-day week of the electoral campaign in 2017.
However, these plans are not currently supported by all Labour Party members.
The spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The International Work Week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it."
John McDonnell, chancellor from the shadow office, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "spectulators" in public utilities.
The chancellor's plans in the shadow office also mean that the current water company shareholders may not recover their full share, as the Labour Party government could make a "debt" based on detected abuse.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in company boards and to set up integrated equity funds to transfer 10 per cent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond in 60 Minutes to the question of whether an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case might change their attitude
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised a question as to whether the findings of the investigative office could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday's interview, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that could change their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina buddy.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when the charge came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined and unequivocal."
However, Graham’s opinion appears to be forged in stone.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and a strong plea is needed to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
‘Not one of the persons who gives is able to verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's gonna change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to any reduction in poverty?
The next Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that can be celebrated with an impressive composition of stars and an equally impressive mission — the eradication of poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important objective of this event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Porty Project, an international group of actors in the fight against poverty by increasing the number of active actors in the fight against poverty.
To receive a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to buy a VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or activities such as volunteering, sending e-mails to a world leader, making telephone calls or other significant activities to help raise awareness of the goal of eliminating poverty.
But with what success can Global Citizens boast for the 12 years remaining to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of awarding people a free concert a good way to convince them to need action, or another case called "cliktivism", when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting an online tweeter?
Global Citizens has claimed that since 2011, there have been more than 19 million "actions" of those supporting the action in order to achieve many different objectives.
It also states that these efforts have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and rules worth more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, which already paid or financed at least $10 billion.
The Group estimates that the safeguards have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and promoters involved in "helping children achieve their full potential", which promised to hand over $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition in this country, after Global Citizens sent over 4,700 tweets.
“Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens such as You, we can make social injustice, which is malnutrition, go into history” — Tracey Ulman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to encourage Britain to improve the quality of maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
For one of the most frequently asked questions on your website, which was “How can you be sure that extreme poverty can be eradicated?”
Global pressurer replied: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But as with the recent great movements for civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars present during this year's New York event, whose hosts will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a war jacket to “block” Russian energy exports — Internal Affairs Secretary
Washington may “if necessary” flee to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from flowing into the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed to the Secretary of Internal Affairs of the United States, Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke maintained that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government — was a pretext for the exploration of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire for energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, on behalf of its Navy, has the opportunity to make sure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to set up a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as “the voice of the consumer of energy” in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same in reality.
"The economic operation of Iran and Russia is about using and replacing fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "student-known trick" with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration continued its mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe — a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, officials of Trump’s administration, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “slave” in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which is intended to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kreml argues that Washington's fervent opposition to this project is based solely on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States sparked a violent reaction from Germany, which confirmed their commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to refrain from interfering with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I believe it is a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting of Chancellor Angeli Merkel with President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she was considering running for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections, she would consider running for president.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidate.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix a corrupt government. It is also for a woman who is the highest in office," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy as president."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trumpie, saying that "he's leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, on Twitter, Warren wrote, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters from Massachusetts who chose the option “probably” said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The probe showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent of the people supported his potential candidate, and 48 percent opposed him.
Other known names from the democratic camp taken into account for potential candidates in 2020 were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the trauma team (PTSD) Track Palin during the Donald Trump election century
Track Palin (26 years) spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, through which he must go back, I understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers return," said Donald Trump, an elected audience in the city of Tulsa in Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of her son "them taboo", after which she said of her son and other war veterans: "They come back slightly different, they come back hard, they come back, wondering if respect will be shown for what their fellow soldiers, the airmen and all the other members of the army have given away from their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasili, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence on a woman, invoking false testimony in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of unwarranted state, as reported by Dan Bennett, spokesman of the State Department of Vasili Police.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
The 18 states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for the new US policy, which refuses to give asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 states and district representatives filed a list of amicus curiè in Washington to support the asylum seekers in this policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the reason behind the complaint by Grace v. Sessions, which American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his brutal gang sons" abused her, but American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors of the United States in support of Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing common problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed the Board of Immigration Appeals decision of 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in a Friday statement that the new policy "ignores the laws of the State, Federal and International for decades".
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such prohibition violates this principle”, as stated in the list of amicus curieæ.
The prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of denying entry harms the U.S. economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and “be a necessary workforce”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"It is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on racial, religious, national or social grounds or because of belonging to a particular social group or having such rather than other political beliefs," said Sessiones in his statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
He never intended to solve all the problems — even the serious ones — that people from all over the world are struggling with every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu when the number of fatalities doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
The situation was becoming more and more tragic for the survivors.
"It's a very intense feeling," said a 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum, comforting her angry son in an evacuation center in a devastated town of Palu.
"The ambulance delivers the body every minute.
There's no clear water."
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching for water-scattered things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were wounded, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were rapidly overcrowded.
Some wounded, including the Two Harris, who suffered fractures in the spine and arms, rested outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears, as he described the sudden earthquake that shook his room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was stuck in the rubble of the wall," Haris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, and her voice was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "begging" propaganda commercials.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page advertisement in an American journal, praising the mutual benefits of American and Chinese trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Pekin of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, referred to China Daily’s paid supplement in Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of trying to interfere with the U.S. Congress, which will take place on November 6th — China denies it.
Trumpa's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections confirmed what American officials said to Reuters that this was a new stage in the escalation of Washington's campaign aimed at putting pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercial advertising with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently in the process of escalation of the trade war, which led to increased tariffs for mutual imports.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to affect exporters in such states as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former multi-year state governor of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said that Pekin had hurt American workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in his article in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register that China “now with doubled force is starting to harass by putting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government is using a respected U.S. tradition of freedom of speech and free press by posting a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
For this, there will be no real opposition in the kiosk street in Beijing and no real reflection of divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on the disturbing economic direction of China, given that the media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans are blaming each other for the mid-term election of women with the right to vote in the Kavanaugh affair, warning analysts
While many leading Republicans support and appoint arms to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns that these members will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent reaction, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely large, and most Republicans already officially want to vote.
“It can’t be undone,” said Grant Reiher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Flake (Arizona)'s efforts to conduct an investigation by the FBI at the last minute were enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow and will not forget it until November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesperson of the progressing MoveOn group, said the newspaper in Washington.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted the slogan “The November Is Coming”, demonstrating in the Senate lobby because of the decision of the Republics controlling the Federal Commission not to withdraw the Kavanaugh nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford — as said by Mick.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation goes beyond the scale," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, said.
"People say that he was already tall, and that is the truth.
But it may be higher, especially among undecided women from suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford’s public statement, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault addressed to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republics had decided to approve the candidate, this could be met with a violent reaction.
"The Republican Party must deal with a small mess," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News, early last week.
"It is not only about voting the committee or final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also about how the Republics have dealt with the situation and how Ford treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priority Group, who assists in the Democratic elections.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater support being given to the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents claimed that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying during the testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI launched an investigation into the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor named Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath to the Senate Council that Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17.

The World Wide Web Network Creator plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web network, launches a startup that is to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source — Solid — Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what persons have access to specific information.
In his interview for the Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of creating Inrupt was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"The historic moment has come."
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform to enable people to create their own “Internet loop with personal data” or other SD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of things to do, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the Internet store with personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to any information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's president, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and adequate skills to help make Solid available to all people.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's security platform, several developers employed in the project and volunteer development community.
Since that week, technology makers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change which, from day to day, will cause the upside down of all their business models.
"Don't ask them permission."
In a media post on Berners-Lee published on Saturday, Berners-Lee said that "the Inrupt mission is to supply commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of the Solid platform".
Berners-Lee changed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has spent a lot of time in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Calling for life Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to think about the next era in network development," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: a celebration by the clergy Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only Church of England, which was celebrated 100 years later in his home town as a combatant during World War I.
Colonel Bernard Vann was appointed on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never finding out he was awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a monumental stone during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, said that the discovery of the stone exactly on the centenary anniversary of the designation of the grandfather was “extremely symbolic. ”
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal “in a very dense fog and under a strong field fire and machine gun”.
Then he rushed to the line of fire and led her forward with "the greatest courage", after which he attacked the field forces in a single attack, destroying three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years old) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that I would never be able to cope with, but with something humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, made a vow after the end of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people".
Fani MMA didn't sleep all night to see the Bellator 206 gala, they got Pappa lead instead.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to see the emotions of Bellator 206 and finally can't see the main fight.
The gala program in San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked by the change of the programme to Peppa.
Some were disappointed when they did not sleep until early morning especially to see this fight.
One Twitter fan described the transition to a cartoon for children as "some sick joke".
"In accordance with the government regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate for it to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President for Marketing and Communication of Bellator, when asked for a transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they would work out a schedule to include the viewers from the UK in the future.
"When I think about the situation again, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
"But Sunday is the sixth morning, and we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed there, we were filled with comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't just a legal failure.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five fights instead of six, which is to the standard amount.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worse" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic leap into the water, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old said he didn't realize that everyone wasn't like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program conducted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent made him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The average head of the program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because of the disease.
As he appeared in the program for the first time conducted by Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt "less valuable" than others, because "the simultaneous love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said: “To this day, this feeling of less value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said that he wanted to prove that he was “worthy of something ” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a prominent activist of the LGBT community and has made use of his appearance at this year's National Community Games in Australia to appeal to more countries for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.
He said that he decided to express himself because he felt happy, able to live an open life without any implications, and that he wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time champion of the world said that falling in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — was “surprising. ”
Daley married Oscar's winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such a difference in age was never a problem for him.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” means your first Olympiad at the age of 14 and your father’s death because of cancer three years later, he said that it was difficult for him to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar incursions and falls.
The couple were parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that his perception of certain things had changed completely.
"The most important thing for me last year was to get a gold medal," he said.
“And you know what? There are more important things than gold medals.
"My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 — he wanted to take place in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "You won't be with us to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, only when he stopped breathing and died did I realize that he was not invincible," he said.
In the following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamt of my whole life — jumping to the water in front of crowds of people in the Olympic Games — it was the best feeling possible," he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — a stream in the performance of Heather Small — that accompanied him during preparations for the Olympic Games and that still seasoned him with goose skins.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing no form of Mickelson on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he'll have to work on his form so she doesn't squeeze her heel.
Mickelson, playing for the 12th time in the event every two years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk during Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the action center, as often happened on his case in the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day poking the team and working on improving his game in the hope of correcting the cause of his departure to the bench.
The 48-year-old who never gave the easiest punches, even at the top of his career, doesn't do well on the tight field of Le Golf National, on which the wrong blows are easily punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not discouraging enough for Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday he must face the accuracy of the winner of the British Open – Francesc Molinari, who joined forces with the debutist Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If Americans (with the loss of four points at the beginning of the 12 singles) start playing with a rope, Mickelson's game may prove to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his opponent — he could not have done anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, knocked me on his back, held my hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He is very confident.
He's in the gallery famous and he's brought a lot of his bands to play both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more of them, but that's how we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will score Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career at Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 failures and seven remissions in his account. Furyk said his presence had brought much to the team.
"He is funny, sarcastic, funny, funny and good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players were having a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings a lot more than a game to his person."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a high point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting the single on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in the Valderram field, where he and his accompanying Vice-Captain Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line passed by at the shortest possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We can't forget that we had a big advantage in the Valderram field; we also had a big advantage in the Brooklyn field, where we lost, and in the Valderram field, we only won for hair," Bjorn said in the photo, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 on Friday and yesterday, which gave the lead 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
Time will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
You're doing your best tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
It'll only be over when the scoreboards show up.
We have a goal to achieve a trophy, and we need to focus on that.
From the beginning, I have said that I am focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the other side are, the best players in the world."
Bjorn, impressed by the way his competitors handled the difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do it better.
But tomorrow is different.
Singles start tomorrow, and that's another question.
It's good to play with a partner when everything goes according to your thoughts, but when you're playing alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit of opportunity.
It's a message that has to be passed on to the players, it's all you have to do tomorrow.
The partner must also give of itself everything."
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to achieve better results on their own than during the game with their partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points with four.
Furik himself experienced a great return to the last day, being a member of the winning team in the Brooklyn field, after which he failed after the European team had "made a miracle in the Medinah field".
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, warmed up to the fight of his players on the last day.
“We are playing 12 important games tomorrow — you would like to start playing at a fast pace, as was the case in Brooklyn and Medinah.
If this drive goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our composition properly and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to take the counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European team players in the leading half of the program.
"I've decided on this group of guys in this order, because I think he'll be able to handle the whole game," Bjorn said about his single election.
New German warship delayed again
The latest German Navy frigate should be put into service in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen until the next year, at least because of faulty systems and rising at an alarming rate — as local media reported.
Dedication to Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuertemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, as reported by the Die Zeit newspaper, referring to the words of the military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the war jacket in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery required changes in this ambitious project.
Four units of the Baden-Wuertemberg class ordered by the war jacket in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and counter-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, inter alia, from reducing radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — the operation of new frigates should be possible for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuing delays mean that these modern warships, which are designed to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will become obsolete at the start of the service, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of the newspapers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commit the ship to operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy turned the ship into a ship after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported on a number of key "software and equipment" that made the battle mission useless.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as Baden-Wuertemberg ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half of which is less than in the case of older Bremen frigates.
It has also turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievements and limits the possibility of future military modernisation by the Navy.
The weighing 7000 tonnes of the Rheinland-Pfalz ship is considered to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project — including crew training — is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a stunning level of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the use of new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that the German Navy's force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, admitted that sailors “end ships capable of use”.
He also said that the problem had increased over time as a result of the withdrawal from the operation of the old units without the provision of replacement vessels.
He also expressed his displeasure with the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New surveys carried out in the Scottish Highlands area aim to show how bats use the landscape to obtain food.
The results of the research are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and help guide future actions to protect them.
Research by researchers from National Trust for Scotland will concern common and minor dwarfs, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the family of red nights in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the property, special registries will be placed to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
Workers and volunteers of NHS will also conduct field studies using portable detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings is designed to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and the manner in which individual species behave.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, an NTS environmental adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of work related to the management of habitats, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways of maintaining forest areas for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that has an impact on the shrubs and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, as well as better for flies and certain chemical products used in building materials, even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of the nighttime habits of their hunting ears, their ears are more helpful than their eyes get caught.
They use complex echolocation techniques to search for bugs and obstacles on their way.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out tests, cluster checks, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organization even established the first and only dedicated reserve of bats in the territory of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of ten Scottish bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says she's an ideal territory for bats.
"Threave has a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are many still unknown about bats. The work we are doing here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of controls for bat control prior to accession to maintenance work in holdings, as unintentional destruction of a single cluster can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected — killing them, harassing them, or disturbing them, and destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public opinion to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don’t even know how to cope with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, while his lawyers are going to sue a German warehouse.
Cristiano Ronaldo defined the charges against him as “fake news” by saying that people want to “promise” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue Der Spiegel's German information magazine, which published these charges.
Portugal's assailant of Juventus was accused of raping American woman Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel's Friday report, the football player was to pay the woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), several hours after the indictment was filed, in an instagramal live message addressed to his 142 million followers, he described these reports as "fake news".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said the five-time gold ball winner.
"They want to promote using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine for charges that have been termed "inadmissible to report suspicions in the area of privacy" — according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount of a corresponding infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged event was to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorge allegedly went to a footballer’s room where he allegedly raped an anal woman — according to documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after he allegedly went down and told her that “99 percent is a good guy” who was visited by this“one percent”.
According to Ronaldo's documentation, the couple had sex, but they had sex with each other.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearing of retaliation" and "public humiliation".
34-year-old says she wants to invalidate the deal now, because she still can't forget the supposed deal.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and that summer he moved to Juventus after paying EUR 100 million for it.
Brexit: United Kingdom “in all times would regret” the departure of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “would regret it all the time” if after leaving the European Union it lost its world leader in car manufacturing, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was "concerned" when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC in an interview that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could lead to job reduction.
The Burnaston factory, which produces the Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Great Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, then production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns — as car manufacturers claim — are the risks associated with the supply chain in the event that the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement.
The Toyota production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, where parts reach 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU in the case of cars produced on order.
If Great Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which the industry believes may lead to delays and shortages.
As the company representative said, Toyota would not be able to endure more than one day without supplies to its factory in Derbyshire, thereby stopping the production.
Clark said that the Chequers Theresa May plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but will also allow us to make the right use of the situation," said BBC Radio 4.
"The statements not only of Toyota, but of other producers show that we have to be able to continue what was made up of a very efficient set of supply chains."
The representative of Toyota was unable to determine how long the production would be stopped, but warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce the company's competitiveness, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the union union union union council, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are to be eliminated, they will never be restored.
The government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union".
Meeting Trump with Rosenstein may be delayed again, as the White House reports.
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "latened by another week" due to the continuing fight for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, as reported on Sunday at the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who explores the possibility of Russian interference in elections, the links between close colleagues Trumpa and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump fired the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic for months in Washington.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports as if he were to resign.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. There was a postponement of the meeting in order to avoid conflicts with the senate board hearing, during which statements were filed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trumpa presswoman Sarah Sanders showed up on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be moved by another week, taking into account all events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'm sure I'll let the press know."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders did not hold a White House press conference since 10 September.
The program manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the small number of press conferences is not caused by the reluctance to "responsible" TV journalists, after which she added: "I will not hide that they are "postentatives".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current President holds more "questions and answers" than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have familiarized ourselves with numbers".
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to direct questions to the President of the United States, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done this very often. Press conferences will give way to such sessions, during which we will be able to speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Salty press conferences are rare.
This week, the president in New York may have demonstrated why, acting too freely and occasionally strangely in front of the journalists gathered.
Minister of Health writes to workers from the European Union employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to workers from the European Union employed in the Scottish Health Service to convey their gratitude from the country and ask them not to leave for Brexit.
Jeanie Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of examining applications for a 'settled status' for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations on Britain’s exit from the European Union continued in the summer.
The British Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery due to head injury
Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, underwent surgery as a result of a head injury in a Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended with a failure of the Tennessee team with a score of 31-27, informed Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, the main coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player suffered injury shortly before the end of the first half.
"He came to the sideline, and then he landed on the ground," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline, then placed it on the stretcher and carried it out in order to carry out further research.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details of the type/size of the injury yet”, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (second year's student released from university representation per year to train his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the game, he had five grains, which gives him 18 grains throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher tax on property purchases in the UK
In line with the new plans, foreign buyers will charge higher taxes for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. The funds thus obtained will be used to help the homeless.
This move is intended to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract a young electorate.
The increase in tax fees will include those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Treasury provides that it will thus receive up to £120 million per year for homeless people.
Theresa May will inform today that foreigners buying real estate in the United Kingdom will be charged a higher tax and the additional funds thus obtained will be allocated to the homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to reverse Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young electorate with promises of cheaper apartments and increase the burden of more earners.
Higher taxes will apply to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK. Additional measures will help the government fight homelessness.
The additional charge — charged in addition to the current tax, including two years ago higher rates for second homes and rental apartments — may amount to three percent.
The state's treasure expects that this move will reach up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and hindering the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy property and spend most of their time outside the country, many rich regions — especially the capital — have become “spirit cities. ”
The new rules are only a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduction in taxes to help young people buy their first house.
He accused large developers of maintaining high property prices by occupying the property but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits of cheap housing to eliminate the "residential scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of the expulsion “for no reason”.
It also wants to give local authorities more power to build new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as a prime minister, I would be engaged in rebuilding the British dream of making the life of each generation better than the last.
This also means the repair of our lost housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work here and build their lives.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can equally easily buy property here, which is a hard-working British resident.
For too many people, the dream of a home has become very distant, for this humiliation associated with the need to stay on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become Scottish selector"
The coach of the Sunderland team, Jack Ross, says that his "best ambition" is to be selected at some point in Scotland.
This 40-year-old Scotland is working with commitment to the healing of the North-East club, which is currently third in League One with a three-point loss compared to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after the last season he introduced the St Mirren club back to the Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to represent my country as a competitor,
But I only managed to get to Staff B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"As a child, I often watched Scotland matches with my father in Hampton, and it always attracted me.
However, this possibility will come only if I succeed as a coach of the club."
Among the predecessors Rossa was Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic claims that he does not feel discouraged, taking the role of such famous personalities in such a large club, rejecting the proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Today, success will be measured for me whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Considering its structure and its facilities, it certainly has its place there," he adds.
"It will not be easy to do this, but I will probably feel that I have succeeded here, only if I succeed."
Rossa's coach career has only been in the past three years. Before that, he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months he was part of the training team of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to re-enhanced after decommissioning into the third league, and in the next season led the St Mirren team from the brink of falling to the title of master.
Jack Ross says he's feeling a lot more comfortable now than when he played Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a real turning point” — that’s how coach Alloa’s position was mentioned.
"I really believed that running the team was much better for me than playing.
It's gonna sound strange, because as a player, I've managed to make a good living, and I've achieved some tangible success.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week, you have to go through a lot of situations.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure associated with the coach's work, but I feel good about this role.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it, and I can tell you that right now I feel the most comfortable place in my adult life."
All the interviews at Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, September 30 on the Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST time
Studies show that the best time for a beer is 17:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a sudden influx of customers to the British pubs, but it hit the restaurant’s network with a hammer.
Studies have shown that sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurants have dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CIS consulting firm, who developed the data, says: “Still heat and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup, caused the results from July to be similar to June when the pub turnover increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the restaurant’s earnings fell even further.
The decrease in sales in restaurants in July, recorded in June 1,8 %, increased even more.
Drinking pubs and bars were far better off — their increase in sales exceeded the decline in restaurants.
Food service pubs also suffered in the heat, although not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
The sale of beverages in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, and the food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman of the RSM, who analyzes the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “These results are included in the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting consumption 'outside home' remain weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that the network of restaurants is experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although the decrease in sales by 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year will have particularly damaging consequences, given the constant pressure on cost reduction.
The long and hot summer has come at the least advantageous time for the owners of the dining rooms and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring such a needed respite."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking these new ones into account, amounted to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the development of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker company, which monitors sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds. It sets recognized industry standards.
One in five children has secret accounts in social media that hides from their parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some just 11 years old — has secret accounts in social networks that it hides from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 higher education students showed an increase in the number of "Fake Insta" sites
These reports have raised concerns that sexual content is published on them.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account that showed parents
One in five children — some at only 11 years of age — is set up in social networks that are not disclosed to adults.
A survey of 20,000 higher education students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts — the name refers to the Instagram service in which the photographs can be shared.
These reports have raised concerns that these accounts serve to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students admit that they run a narrow “main” account that shows their parents and that they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers who accidentally stumbled onto the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter met a teenager who urged others to “rape her”.
A study conducted at independent schools by the Digital Awareness UK agency and the Headmasters' and Headmises' Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of pupils between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, half of which are admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC Association President Mike Buchanan says: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are creating their places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics Board.
At the annual general meeting of the Management Board, Scottish Athletics Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most described scotch minor. President Ian Beattie has identified this move as an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her rich international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Lights Community and we are confident that its introduction into the board will bring great benefits to the Scottish Lightsman", Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very pleased that I will be able to give the Council the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really help manage sports in Scotland.”
An American who, among his four gold Olympic medals, has won the race for 200 and 400 metres at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and now regularly appears in the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell me whether I would regain efficiency and to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I was completely healed, and I learned to walk again and went back to practice!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
The advertising of lactating women, which compares mothers to cows, arouses extreme emotions on the Internet
The company that produces lactators has created a storm on the Internet, publishing an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to milked cows.
To announce the placing on the market of “the world’s first silent lactator for wearing clothing”, its producer, Elvie, published a lively commercial in the form of video, which underlines the freedom it provides to mothers.
She introduces four true mothers dancing in a song filled with hay to the song that says, "Yes, I do, but I do not see the tail" and "If you don't see it, it's not just my tits."
Then the refrain goes: “Put them up, pump them out, feed them children, pump them out, pump them out, I will impress my lords.”
The advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused major controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of which claim that it is inappropriate to joke about the horror that takes place in the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to calves, even though their children are taken away from them after a few days of birth," one of the users wrote.
The Lectator of Elvie can be worn undetected under an Elvie/Mother breast-feeding system.
Another person commented: “It is, of course, traumatic for both mother and child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactating women who can keep their children."
Another said: “This advertisement is completely detached from reality.”
Another feature of the video was that one woman said that the song was “joyful. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I could still breast-feed, I'd have bought one.
I felt like a cow when I was pulling away food.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I'm not looking into the other bottom.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Some commented: “It’s a funny ad addressed to mothers who draw food (often at work or toilet) and feel like cows.
It is not intended to praise or criticise the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out women danced with lacquers attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women feel like cows.
However, the Lactator Elvie is completely quiet, there are no cables or pipes, and you can wear it undetected under the breastplate to feed, which gives women the freedom to move, to hold children on their hands, and even to leave the house while drawing food.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a courageous and provocative premiere.
With the feeding of women and dairy cows together, we wanted to show all the challenges involved in withdrawing food, presenting in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
It's not the first time that the Lactator Elvie hit the top of the paper.
During the London Fashion Week, during the show Marty Jakubowski on the run, the mother of two children with this particular product appeared.
Hundreds of immigrant children were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained is increasing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border does not change every month. This is partly due to the fact that the strict rhetoric and rules introduced by President Trump's administration have made it difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually undocumented immigrants who fear being deported if they apply for a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential sponsors and other adult residents of the joint holding would be subject to fingerprints which would then be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who volunteered as sponsors for children left unaccompanied.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees were not previously reported.
“Almost 80 per cent of those who are sponsors or who live with them in one household are illegal in the country, and most of them are foreign nationals with a criminal background.
That is why we are constantly pursuing them," Albence said.
Officials say that as part of their efforts to speed up the regulation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not 60 days, as had been done in accordance with previous standards.
Many will stand by videoconferencing, not personally, to ask an immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those who are not eligible for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier it can become to become restless or depressed, which in turn may lead to an outbreak of aggression or escape attempts.
The defense has found that these problems are even more serious for larger centres, such as Tornillo, where because of its size it is easier to overlook signals that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that the transfer of children to the tent camp without providing them with adequate time for emotional preparation or goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma that many of them already face.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to withdraw immediately
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called refugees from Syria to return home, although the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moual, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally residing on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “we will deal with them accordingly”.
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally” he announced to the assembly.
Moual claims that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to "bring its holy battle to the cleansing of the territory of Syria" from both terrorist groups and from "all foreigners residing illegally".
Currently, there are about 2,000 US soldiers in Syria who are mainly involved in training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian against President Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, there are over 1,000 French soldiers in a war - torn country.
As for the refugees, Moual stated that the conditions are good enough to allow them to return, and accused "some Western countries" of "inciting an irrational fear" which discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations for assistance in these returns," he said.
"They politicalize matters that should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad enters into an opposition to a political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
UN diplomacy says that the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebel bastion in Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The arrangement between Russia and Turkey has helped to prevent a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia into a province in which three million people live.
Moual stressed, however, that the agreement had "a clear time frame", and hoped that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaida-related Front of the Lebanese People's Defence, who would be "killed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon for the first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the governing party and opposition in order to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and prepare for the elections.
Moual outlined the conditions for the Syrian Government to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "to verify the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected to second term in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers may hope, his presidency will soon end with removal from office and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of the presidency so far”.
So far, there's no sign of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, the results of the CNN canal watching in the primate have doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and the MSNBC channel nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to the Nielsen Fox News agency, on average 2.4 million viewers are attracted in the highest viewing hours, which is an increase of 1.7 million years ago, and the programme "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast in the MSNBC channel has reached the highest scores on cable television, attracting up to 3.5 million viewers of evening news programs.
"People are flying like moths to the fire -- that's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the main producer of the ABC series "Designed by Survivors" about the secretary of the office, who after an attack on the Capitol becomes president.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy creator and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She mentions how she drove a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied.
“Haos has entertainment value”.
Of course, reports from Washington could, as otherwise shown on television, judge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of the integration of immigrant families or the state of the world economy.
Disengagement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen when you watch for the sixth hour a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward by secret informants in writing the book "Fear" about Paul Manafort's skin jacket for $15,000 (the stuff loaded with pride, as defined by The Washington Post) or the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatomy revealed by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again like I used to.
“What he does is partly like a reality show in that he provides new content every evening,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars”, about changing casts and daily returns of action show Trump (as an attack on NFL league players or praise Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're going to get stuck.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, where she owns her home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Court Commission and the future of the Supreme Court was respected.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy programs and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

The flow of money from the outside to the electoral campaign into Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the constituencies, which in the race for one position now stands two congressmen, up to the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania is the river of cash.
This recently formed Pittsburgh suburban district is represented in Congress by a representative of the Democrats, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during a special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is largely related to the new district 17.
The maps of the districts were corrected following the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, which stated that the old districts were unfairly designated, which gave precedence to the Republics and was inconsistent with the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district started with the campaign funding between the main party funding bodies — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning for hair in widely commented elections up to the 18th electoral district, which took place in March.
The Republican has been in this position for more than a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Political experts gave the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but has withdrawn from this idea.
The diplomats noticed that Dominicana and Panama had already recognized Beijing, despite Washington's slight opposition.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with President Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until his release by partners of Trump Organization's managing team, he had a hotel in Panama.
Officials of the State Department decided to cancel the US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominicans and Panama because of “the recent decisions to suspend Taiwan’s recognition” as told by Secretary of State Heather Nauert in her statement this month.
However, the sanctions were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million from the United States in 2017 to assist, inter alia, in the fight against drugs and in supporting development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which would cover restrictions on financial assistance and the granting of visas to certain persons, would be very distressing for this Central American country, which is struggling with high unemployment and a high rate of murder.
As the international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference to address the proposals of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
In mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus cutting off any reflection on the sanctions against El Salvador.
The diplomats say that at the conference which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to appear, which is supposed to be a signal to invite representatives of the administration to the meeting.
Three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominicans, and there were no new severe messages or penalties from Washington.
The Spokesperson for the White House, John Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate presented by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal perceptions on the condition of anonymity.
Their relationship was confirmed by an external analyst from the administration, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn the History
Another element may be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Mueller, on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is currently available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also investigated whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If the Congress changes, President Trump will be held responsible during preparations for re-election before the constituencies, or even tried before the jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not mean that the collapse of Trump — or people in equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will decide how long this can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It didn't work, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history rotate around such turning points, accelerating or slowing the inevitable march of democracy.
There are now several such turning points in front of Americans.
What do we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since we found out in our paper that last year he proposed a covert recording of the president and speculated that he wasn't fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the relationship presented by the Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court Judge despite the credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony against him?
Above all, will we, in the middle of the presidential term, choose the people to hold Donald Trump accountable to Congress?
If we don't pass these trials, there will be tough times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lessons I received in Prague.
My mother was a Bohemian Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light sabasa candles on that table marked with swastika.
With such an inheritance, how could I not look to the future optimistically?"

Rangers Club leader Graham Dorrans, with optimism waiting for a match with the Rapid Vienna team
Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory with Austria, won after the impressive Villareal draw this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of becoming a G League of Europe.
Until the draw 2:2 from Villareal knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans' assistant from playing this season, but he believes that this result will work on the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"We did it well because Villarreal is in good shape," said 31-year-olds.
"We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something, and we fought the point.
Maybe at the end we could have squeezed them, but in general, the remission is probably a fair result.
Spain was probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope we can get three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent has won a good score in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass and we will win a positive score.
Last year was definitely hard because of everything about my injury and the changes in the club itself, but now we're all feeling good in our seats.
The team's great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings spends sleep over the eyelids of women
Although those involved knew exactly how they wanted to be treated, few talked about it with their family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said that she had talked to her spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the company Nationwide selling life insurance.
Where to begin?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare a family to care for yourself unless you express your will in advance.
Talk with your counselor and family about where and how you want to be taken care of, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for help from the financial advisor: he can help find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenditure, or on your own property, if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: This will prevent the battles from taking place.
Design a trusted healthcare officer who will supervise and ensure that appropriate persons act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider, too, the employment of an attorney to handle finances.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and ensure that all accounts are paid if you are unable to do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your parent suddenly needs medical help and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Get all the information you need so you can have it ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
‘What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having a plan."
Man shot repeatedly from a windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was shot repeatedly by a windmill when he was coming home from the party.
The 40-kilogram was located in the vicinity of Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe in Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police described the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST time as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries suffered do not endanger a man's life, and the police are asking for witnesses to the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the disrupted communication, rescuers failed to obtain any information from the Donggala cabupatene, which is located north of Palu, near the 7.5-degree earthquake epicentre.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the Palu disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about Palu and Donggala Cabbage on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of Celebez Central, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island. In 2017 it was estimated that 379,800 people lived there.
When there was an earthquake and a tsunami, the city held the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit lower than the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebes economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed particularly in the Donggal Cabbage on the coast.
Another source of revenue for the province is nickel mines, but they are located mainly in Moraly, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to Indonesia's Catastrof Disaster Management Agency, in the last 100 years, the earthquake and the tsunami have visited Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, the tsunami that struck Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in West Donggali.
Indonesia is on the active Pacific Fire Ring seismically, which causes earthquakes to occur quite regularly there.
The largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake, which on December 26th visited the western coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumtra, caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the western coast of Sumtra visited a series of severe earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the Sumatra coast.
2006: In the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, there was an earthquake of 6.8 degrees, triggering tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatry, there was an earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai near the coast of Sumatra. It caused a tsunami wave of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Cabupaten Pidie Jaya in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami wave, but more than 100 people were killed by rolling buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They destroyed thousands of homes and caused temporary problems for thousands of tourists.
Sarah's eldest son, Palin, arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice president candidates Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers from Wasilla, Alaska, 29-year-olds, he was arrested with domestic violence charges, obstructing the filing of a complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to report a crime, he took her phone.
KTUU Station reports that Palin is in custody by an investigator named Mat-Su and has a bail of $500.
According to her information last Saturday, he was brought before a court of law, where in his defense, he said that he was “probably innocent”.
They're carrying three class A offenses on Palina, which means he can get a year in prison and $250,000 fines.
He was also accused of a class B offense, for which he would face a penalty of $2,000 in prison and fines on the day.
This isn't the first time that Palin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an attack.
The case is now pending before the Alaska Veteran Claims Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of and possession of weapons in a state of negligence in connection with this incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, groups of veterans criticized Sara Palin, who linked his aggressive behavior with the trauma syndrome he had experienced during his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died as a result of the tsunami after the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a Friday earthquake that haunted the island of Celebes, Indonesia.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not functioning and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of Celebes island, located north of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
In social media, there are films showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been committed in this state for federal crime since 1953.
To carry out an attack that took place in October on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, Saipov allegedly used his rented truck Home Depot, which was driven by pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notification from the New York District of intent to demand the death penalty in order to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “targeted” killed eight victims and “targeted” caused serious injuries to the body.
According to the court's file, both charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the federal attack, the jury presented to Saipov an indictment involving 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in an illegal activity — a procedure usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases — as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, organizing an attack required “solid planning and thought-out”. The way Saipov carried it out was defined as“ horrendous, cruel and immoral”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Herna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca” says an announcement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine nationals living in New York City.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the southern district of New York was ten years ago.
Accused Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he heard his sentence of life.
The death penalty as a result of a federal case was last executed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Marriage was lost after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, which originated in Uzbekistan, there was no remorse during the months following the attack.
The police say he told the investigator that he was feeling good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films he was watching on the phone.
According to the police, he also demanded the suspension of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
An indictment involving 22 charges is answered by an innocent man.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys from Saipov's office, said that they were “for obvious reasons disappointed” by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early release after pleading guilty will only prolong the suffering that these events have caused to all concerned," he said.
Saipov's defense team had asked prosecutors earlier not to demand the death penalty.
Parliamentarian says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for negotiations on Brexit
During today's protest during the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "feel hot" beatings from Eurosceptics, when one of Parliamentarians Theresa May suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Deputed on behalf of conservatives, Peter Bone, told demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage had been Secretary of Brexit, “the United Kingdom would have been outside the Union”.
However, the addition of torstoises for remaining in the community to a separate protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further highlighted the difficulty of reconciliation of its deeply divided ranks, which lie ahead of Theresa May.
Madam Prime Minister is struggling to implement his plan of compromise with Chequers among the attacks by the supporters of Brexit, its opponents, as well as the European Union itself.
Its allies claim that despite the opposition, it will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and labs to make a choice between its proposal and its “chaos”.
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "drop out the plan from Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should become a full-time agent, who should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did it, we would be out of the Union now," he said.
Deputies from Wellingborough added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw out a plan from Chequers.”
Voicing his opposition to the European Union, he said: “That is not why we have fought world wars to subject ourselves to someone now.
We want our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens changed their mind since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British changed their mind and wanted to stay in the Union is completely false."
At the demonstration was also supported by Brexit Andrea Jenkyns from a tory party that said to reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan doesn't enjoy the general support, the opposition won't vote for it, our party or our activists who populate the streets and who chose us don't support it either.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In her speech to Prime Minister May, she added: “Precessors maintain their positions when they keep their promises. ”
Nigel Farage stated that politicians involved in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a question of trust between us — the people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell 'em we won't let you do it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the politicians who are on the verge of the Betrayal of Brexit feel hot.
"We mobilise the army of this country's people who gave us the victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, the opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
The band of activists waved banners “Torys v. Brexit” after the group was formed this weekend.
Activist labyrinth, Baron Andrew Adonis, ridiculed conservatives for problems with the security of party applications at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who claim to be able to organise IT systems and all technology to support Canada plus, liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
‘It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "seriously consider" presidential candidate
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says after the November elections, "he will seriously consider running for president".
As The Boston Globe reports, a Democrat representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future in a meeting with voters held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will seek re-election in November. Her opponent will be the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trumpa campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that Warren can defeat Trump in the 2020 elections.
Saturday's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took over the office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government — and she also means a woman upstairs. ”
Arresting the deadly shooter in which the LSU team player Wade Sims died
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana informed on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on a Friday shooting in which a basketball player from the LSU team, Wayde Sims, died.
The Baton Rouge Police Department informed of the arrest of 20-year-old Diteon Simpson during a conference that took place at 11:00 Eastern Time.
On Friday, a video of a shooting with a request for help to identify the man you saw on it was published.
Twenty-year-old Wade Sims died from a gunshot near the Southern University campus Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot from a firearm to the head, which led to his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun, and shooting at Wade.
After his arrest, when he did not resist, he was transferred to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department in custody.
At 1.98 metres, Junior Wade Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games, and in the last season he started 10 times, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes in the park, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 points for the match.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the command of the Mercedes team would have a big impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, began very well and nearly defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two districts and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the service station first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the peletone tail, which should decide on the fate of the race.
Mercedes’s leader went to boxing in the next round and appeared behind Vettel, but after a stake in the circle, which led the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the inner part of the track, risking a defensive push to the defensive after the double movement of the rival to defend the position on the third corner, Hamilton moved on to lead.
Max Verstappen started at the end of the stake, and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round he was in the seventh place.
He then led a large part of the race by not changing tyres to complete the fast finish and take back Kimi Raikkonen’s fourth position.
Finally, he went to a service station on the 44th lap, but in the other eight laps, he couldn't make it any faster.
“It was a hard day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team has done its best to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body talk.
During a meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump interrogated Senator Diana Feinstein, who maintained that she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the statements made by Christina Ford to the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he stated that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “understanding, malicious and lying”.
"What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have been witnessing for several days, when we see anger when we see people who are angry, vile, and lying," he said.
"We see what has been published and revealed, and then they tell us 'Oh, I didn't do it'.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianno Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Remember her answer... did you disclose the contents of this document? Oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we didn't reveal," he added, stabbing the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and his contents leaked out in early September. The senator denies that the leak was her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s insinuation, I didn’t reveal her story, ” Feinstein testified to the commission, as reported by The Hill.
"She asked me for discretion and I did not disclose this content according to her request."
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on it during the Saturday meeting: “I’m telling you, it was really bad body talk.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body talk I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend a candidate for a Supreme Court judge whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use insinuations for their own ends.
‘They are determined to take power by all means.
You can see meanness, wickedness, they don't care about who they harm, who they have to destroy to take power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite's reports.

Air traffic controller is dying, helping hundreds of people on an airplane escape from an earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia was yelled at by a hero after he died, helping safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died, and many were considered missing after a great earthquake that struck the island of Celebes in Indonesia on Friday, causing tsunamis.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the area, and in Palu many people have been trapped in the rubble.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthónius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the scattered control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was there to make sure that Batik Air (lot number 6321), which was on the runway, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to reports from the Australian station ABC News spokesman Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the controller's decision probably saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from the city of Balicappan to Borneo to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This message has broken our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of fatalities can reach thousands. The National Disaster Management Agency reports that the possibility of reaching the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death continues to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The tsunami wave of six meters destroyed Palu, where the mass funeral of the victims took place on Sunday.
Military and civilian planes provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusum, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News Station: “Ambulances constantly import bodies.
It's starting to run out of drinking water.
Small stores are looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross hastens to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find.
It's already a tragedy, and it could get worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu, who turned to the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
This year, Indonesia was visited by an earthquake that killed over 550 people on Lombok Island.
An airplane crash in Micronesia — the Niugini Air Line reports that one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
The airlines operating the flight, which crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, informed that one person was missing and previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that according to the data on Saturday afternoon, they could not count on one man who was traveling on a feral plane.
They've ensured that, together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they're trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water during an airport landing attempt on Chuuk Island, rescue the other passengers and crew members helped the local boat.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airlines said that on Saturday in the hospital there were six passengers left, all in stable condition.
It's not clear what caused the disaster.
The United States Air Lines and Navy claim that the plane landed on the lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of his belt.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was coming very low.
"This has helped us very much," he said.
Jaynes said that he and others had managed to get through the belt of water into the emergency sinking aircraft.
According to him, crew members of the crew panicked and shouted, and he himself carried out a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that in a rescue operation, sailors who were working nearby to modernize the coastline, managed to transport people to shore by means of a blowboat, before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the last two decades in the crash of aircraft belonging to the Papua New Guinea-registered airlines, but there are no Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed the night events when the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the D.A. concluded the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Justice Department, Paul Rowlett, testified for many hours as a fugitive in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how using mobile phone records, he reopened the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he had obtained location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on a feral night, so he overturned his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that while Quinton was to be with his friend Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interview Sanford.
Saturday, Sanford testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he replied that “he lied because my truck was in Nashville at the time”.
Another inaccuracies is Tellis' claim that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her contact details from her phone, SMS and phone calls.
"He removed her from his life," Hale said.
The final defence is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said the case was likely to be handed over to the jury the same day.

Team members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of a conscious hip-hop.
The creativity of artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK has recently led to the rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Commons.
Another black one?
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for release after a "racist" SMS
Nanny, from New York City, pleads for her dismissal from work on a racist basis after receiving a misreading SMS in which the mother of the child complains that she is “another black person”.
The couple deny that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to "smart."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly converged when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who had a vase on her first day at work in 2016, was black skin.
“NOE, A ENVIRONMENTAL ONE, ” she wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, by mistake, she sent him twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to reports from the New York Post newspaper, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that she had committed a mob, "broken" dismissed Gisella Maurice, claiming that a hearty nanny who was African-American had miscarried her duties and she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice received a day's pay and was then sent to the house by Uber.
Now he claims a couple of compensations for a $350 release a day, multiplied by six months, for which she was originally employed with residence, although she did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that things don't happen," said the Post newspaper on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied the charges of racism, claiming that the end of cooperation with Mrs. Maurice was justified because after insulting her, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she wasn't going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," he told the Post husband, Joel Plasco.
“ Would you entrust your children to the person you have offended, even if it had been a mistake?
Your new baby?
Oh, come on."
Comparing the lawsuit for "student," Plasco said that his wife had only been born two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to blow something like that?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the court case is not over, the public opinion quickly handed down a couple of sentences in social media, criticizing her for her behaviour and the way she thinks.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the books on Paddington were afraid that readers would not feel connected to the talking mission
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm adoption of the book, says of the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of the first person to read it before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He claims that her father, who, before the little bear had inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a cameraman in the BBC, he was sure that his work would be rejected. He also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book seems "sweet and bitter".
About Paddington, described as “a very important member of our family, ” she says that her father was secretly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't brag," he added.
“However, since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something — you felt proud of him, although it was not your fault.
I think Paddington's success was more or less perceived.
Although he invented it and created it himself, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"He called regularly and said it was really bad that he probably won't get out of it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say that Natasha would die within two minutes, and I must say good-bye to her.
I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be at your place soon.
I'll be at your place.
The medications that her doctors gave to keep her heart pumping slowly stopped and were eliminated from her body.
She died a while earlier, and that was the end of it all.
All I could do was sit there and wait with the knowledge that all this is developing.
I couldn't howl, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry because I was with other people.
I had to really hold on."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers, unaware of the torture she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head down, and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all-cheering sympathy for Nad.
I felt I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning postcards are designed to help prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide try to seduce others from the intent of taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers under which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he got depressed, and he took his life at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydia, relates that her son was a well-predicted chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said they could clear up every room."
But before he died, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 years old, and he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis has created cards “to tell people that there are people to whom you can contact and whom you can talk to, even if you only know them.
Don't be silent, talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
"He didn't say that he feels down, sad or anything," he says.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was already in a complete hole at Christmas, when the children opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “This is what breaks out a hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in Italian because the FBI is launching an investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for — a limited time and a limited amount of investigation — we might have achieved some unanimity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "falling apart" at the opposite camps, which leads to an impassion.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
All their disapproval comes from the moment.
The elections to Congress are already a few weeks from 6 November. If Republicans are expected to lose them, the chances of choosing a person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush had already raised his earpiece to call the senators and urge them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and met Ashley's wife, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI makes a report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not certain that Brett Kavanaugh won at least 50 senators' votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the imprison and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of North Korean fugitives decreases
According to a South Korean legislator, since seven years ago, Kim Zhong Un has taken over power, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Union, Park Byeong-seug said that there were 1127 escapes last year and in 2011 there were 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more precise border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates taken by smugglers.
Pjongjang did not issue a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are ultimately proposed South Korean citizenship.
According to the authorities in Seoul, since the Korean war ended in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans from the North have illegally crossed the border.
Most of the Chinese people who have the longest border with North Korea are fleeing, so it is easier to cross it than a strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often force them back to the country.
Relations between North and South, which are theoretically still in the state of war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pjongjang, where they held talks on negotiations on denuclearisation, which had earlier become a dead issue.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, which took place in June in Singapore. The fruit of this meeting is a general agreement on the quest to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of not making any progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty as to our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no possibility for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves as the first," Ri said in a speech he delivered before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a 'hysterics' and claims that he is not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "hysterics" and said that he was naturally not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke these words during an interview, which she gave Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman behaved this way, she would be considered a 'hysteric'," Pelosi said about her reaction to the statements Kavanaugh made before the Justice Senate on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost screaming and losing his speech when he was discussing family and school years.
He also made it clear to the Democrats of the Commission that the charges against him were "gratesque and coordinated repute" organised by the liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because it exposed his prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from the office if he received the nomination and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"I say this: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court but also serve in this court in which he currently works," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was afraid of the possible rulings of Kavanaugh on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade process, because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing, the question of whether or not he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the time to introduce a hysterical court, a preconceived person who will expect us to say ‘but it’s wonderful,” Pelosi added.
And women have to own it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of fury spilling, and she can't throw it away without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
"I think it's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was the manager of a company helped me a lot, and she said that she was crying when she was angry, but she thought out that when she got upset and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You sure think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm mad.
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are acceptable as the mouth of anger partly because they are in principle misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first positions in a man - dominated office is how I once began to cry out of inexorable anger. An elderly woman, a cool manager, who I was always a little afraid of — grabbed my neck and took me to a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they're happy that they've done it."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, who was then deputized to Congress with Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated to the borders of Patricia, she realized that she could actually consider the idea of an independent presidential candidate.
"It was not a thought-out decision," she said, laughing 30 years later.
"Seven other candidates have already been elected, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone has defined this situation as the "Queen Snow White and the Seven Gorgeous".
Since the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder had a backlog in fundraising and promised herself he would not join the race if he didn't raise $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
She then discovered that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, had only 250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she declared that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions — gratitude for those who supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and address voters, not delegates, and anger at sexism — that she was bound by a voice in her throat.
"You might think I've had a nervous breakdown," the press said.
"You might think I'm being sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my tombstone.

What the benefits of Beijing’s economic war between the United States and China can bring
The opening of the US-China economic war was deafening, and while the battle is still going on, in the longer term the conflict between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
This year's first warning was fired by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new duty rates on goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), leading to the taxation of half of all goods entering the United States of China.
Every time Beijing retaliated in nature, it recently increased its U.S. duty of $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every US strike and does not seem to be the second economy in the world to give up soon.
By forcing Washington to withdraw, it means accepting demands, but public head restraint in front of the United States would be too embarrassing for the president of China, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure resulting from the US trade war could in the long term strengthen China by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic chaos in one country is, in fact, much more dangerous than observers have already given," said Abigail Grace, a researcher in Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Syria is “ready” to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready to return refugees voluntarily, and asks for assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Syria, Walid al-Moual, said that the conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in our area is now more stable and secure because of the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
In order to restore normalcy, the government is constantly rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met that refugees who have had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic developments in their daily lives and means of maintenance may voluntarily return to it.
Since the beginning of the war in 2011, the United Nations has estimated over 5.5 million citizens to have left Syria.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moual said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept aid provided by conditions or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals the victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team with 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has already lost six times in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup Cup Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when under the leadership of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, it gained 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, whose most tournament was not going too well, hit the ball from the base straight to the water at the 16th PAR3 hole, thereby giving the match to Francesca Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari glossed over all rounds and became one of four players, who since 1979, when this first tournament took place in the current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spith was eliminated by 5&4 by the lowest ranking player in Europe, Thorbjorn Oleseen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world ranking, lost two holes before the last hole with Englishman Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
A European with the largest number of victories in Ryder Cup was Spain Sergio Garcia, who already took part in eight of these tournaments and won 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm very happy to get my bladder back.
It's a success for the whole team and I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia after winning the team from Europe.
He sends a stick to his native John Rahm, who won the game Sunday with a single American golf legend, Tiger Woods, with a score of 2&1.
"I smell the incredible pride of winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all matches in France and now has scored 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
It's an unusual statistic, like one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 most important titles, and only gave up to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team has been having trouble finding a treadmill all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance by the U.S. captain Jim Furyk, he said: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we squeezed some Europeans.
We're out of here.
The hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Board, Ryder Cup, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
Flower information — in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasote, the density of plankton decreases
Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's latest report shows a general decrease in the density of plankton in some parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the presence of psrtrich flower has been reported in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting that it is shrinking.
It extends to about 209 kilometres of the coastline, from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
The blooms can be found about 16 kilometres from the Hillsborough coast, but compared to the previous week in fewer places.
The flower was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there were averages of plankton by the coast and in the waters of Pinellas, low to average by the coast of Hillsborough, natural to high Manatee, natural to high by the coast and the waters of Sarasota, natural to medium by Charlotte, natural to high by the coast and on the waters of Lee County, and low in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, respiratory irritation cases are still reported.
Last week, however, they were not recorded in northwest Florida.
