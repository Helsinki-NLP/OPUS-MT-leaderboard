The white pawn on f3, the black pawn on the e6, the white pawn on the g4, the black cut on the h4 mat! In chess circles it is called a joke “dupka matt”.
White: the decks on a1, on foot by b6, the king on c8. Black: on foot by a7 and b7, the king on a8, the elephant on b8. The whites put the opponent in the position of the Tsugang, putting the deck on a6, then the blacks have only two options: take the deck on a6 or move the elephant on any other field of diagonals b8 to h2. In the first case, the whites move the foot from b6 to b7 and place the mat. In the second case, the white lady takes the black pawn to a7 with the same result.
