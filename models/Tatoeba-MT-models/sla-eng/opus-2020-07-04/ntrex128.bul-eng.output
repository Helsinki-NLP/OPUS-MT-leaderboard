The members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that “they look like mumbles. ”
Part of the Assembly members are mocked by the proposal to change their title to the “HUP” (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be a cause for ridicule.
One of the liberals said that his group was worried that the new name was "Roma with Tup and Duplub".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh this certainly is offensive.
According to one party member Plaid, the whole group “is not happy” and offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party indicated that his group was "not biased" to change the name, but noted that the new name PMP (in English – MWP) had a certain word similar to "mopette".
In this context, the Welsh letter W refers to the English Yorkshire word U.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the draft draft law to change the name, made the following statement: “The final decision on all descriptive names, with which the members of the Assembly are called, will be understood to belong to the members themselves”.
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling it the "Wels Parliament".
As far as its members' office is concerned, the Commission prefers "a member of the Welsh Parliament, briefly "CPU", but the "HUP" option received the greatest support after questioning the society.
Members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, from which the draft law on change is expected to be submitted to the draft for a few weeks.
The Reform Bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they reach the draft.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that her northern neighbour's name represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed her attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the name of the state, said he would not read the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the state is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut against the problems of churches in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people with whom I spoke, there was a bar and church literally on every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today both have disappeared."
Adams says disappearing bars is understandable.
"People today are socialised in different ways," he added.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood daily, where everyone gathers regularly."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later will be in the same position".
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people don't support the survival of the other shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them."
Both churches were built by white pastures before Harlem turned into a neighborhood of black people – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white methodist herd was exported over the years since 1930.
After that, the building became the possession of the black inhabitants of the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was poeted by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe damage to the fire, but Father Johnson's enormities drew up a plan for its restoration, which ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's heir, proudly calls them "the poor bells."
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural Treasure" and "An irreplaceable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Nga of Michigan University, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world that was used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Linde, who moved to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marioueder mentions that St. Martin never replaced him.
What has been played in St. Martin over the past few weeks has been a complicated story, woven by architects and performers, some brought by the world leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Empire.
From the press – which is the governing body of the flock, consisting of world leaders – wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concern that the diocese “would be willing to transfer the expenses of the public service”, although he did not have a role in hiring architects and performers sent from the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the eparchy.
A 13-year-old kid got hurt by a lobster shark in California.
Shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy last Saturday, while it dived into lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, the representative organs reported.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. in the vicinity of Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel shared in front of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was snooping with his friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and went in with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hammel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, and then he realized how he was yelling “Taste me!
He bit me!"
Hammel says when he got to the boy, he realized that the whole area of his key was torn apart.
"I called on everyone to get out of the water because there is a shark!" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Radio Child Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Saviour Captain Larry Gilles spoke at a media briefing that a few weeks earlier, a shark had been spotted in the water, but it was thought not to be a dangerous species.
Jill adds the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper body.
The authorities responsible closed the access to the Ponto Beach coastline in Casablanca to Suomi in Ensitinas within 48 hours of safety considerations while the investigation was under way.
Jill notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which, however, do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans an offensive on the UK beauty market
Sainsbury confronts Boots, Supercool and Debenhams by opening stands for ornamental products in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK beauty product market, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to increase while sales of fashion and household products are decreasing, the biggest flower stands will be located in 11 shops across the country, followed by more sites in the success of the initiative.
The investment turn in the beauty industry is done at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the wires, recently occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury they said they would double the number of products offered up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current products gamma from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, like the offers in the Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-launchs its boutique range of makeup, so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger consumers.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Seli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and moving focus on shopping smaller amounts of food daily at convenient times leads to the need for supermarkets to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury, has shared that the sites will look more and more like universal stores, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight with Aldi and Lidl discountaries, offering more services and non-food items.
From Sainsbury have facilities of Argos in hundreds of stores, and also open sites of Habitats since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has increased the sales of food goods and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to redesign its objects for ornamental and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint attempt with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's premises in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business to 281 Celesio sites, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will have a role in the plan, providing a rich range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have formed the type and nature of our beautiful stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the ground.
The range of brands offered by us is intended to respond to every taste and all necessary in a plethora with a convenient location, this combination turns us into an attractive destination for beautiful products, which challenges the concept of the old way of shopping itself."
Peter Jones "Wrathful" after Holly Wilbby refused a deal for £11 million
Dragons Den Peter Jones' star "fleeted" after the TV host Holly Willoby gave up a deal of 11 million pounds with his Lifestair company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilbby doesn't have time for the brand of household appliances and accessory Truly.
The couple's business is compared to Goop's Gwynet Poltrow brand.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced her leaving at Instagram.
Holly Wilbby left the star from Dragons Den Peter Jones "to boil" after withdrawing from their profitable business with the brand products for the Lifestile in the last minute – focusing on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones “was pissed off” when the TV’s “golden girl” admitted during the tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean that there would no longer be time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is similar to the Goop of Gwynet Poltrow brand, and rumors are that he doubled Wilbby's wealth, the value of which is projected at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Wilbby announced in Instagram his leaving Truly, Jones left Britain on a plane to head to one of his vacation properties.
One of the sources said: “Truly was Holly’s highest priority.
Its long-term commitment was expected to ensure its future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave is completely unprepared.
Nobody believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe headquarters that's full of waiting products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading "This morning", which is one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, as well as could lead to a delay in putting the brand on the market.
And last but not least, it may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Wilbby, who's her mother to three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband, is a close friend of Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years now.
Wilbby himself founded Truly together with Kapp in 2016, as Jones, who was 52 years old, joined as company president in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the Baldwin production company's television company.
Willowby will become the M&S brand's "sentresser" and will also replace Anne McParlin as head of the "I'm a celebrity" broadcast on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business activities.”
Difficult negotiations leading to "warning relations"
He joked about the criticisms he would have received from the press channels for making comments that would be considered "unsuitable for the President" and as too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his own joke "novinarian" way.
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as a "great step towards the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But the negotiations to eliminate this weapon are stagnating.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top North Korean diplomat Ri Young Ho announced to the UN General Assembly that North Korea “does not see reciprocity” by the US to the first steps of his country on the route of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were heading for a war with this country.
Millions of people would die.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results – the cessation of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of the bodies of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd ahead.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia ravaged the island and led to hundreds of deaths
Following the earthquake in Lombok of foreign NGOs, it was said that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population have been forced to leave their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, there is an unequivocal opinion that no international assistance is requested, which makes things slightly challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is a team to head to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country's territory.
The National Speaker of the Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palau to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the reconstruction efforts.
Given the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this kind of natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the case of tsunamis, they were not often seen on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu is likely to contribute to the loss of life, although a warning has been issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more difficult.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship has gone to Palu, but it will be at least three days before he manages to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has turned Indonesia's lagging infrastructure into the centre of its election campaign by investing a large amount of money in roads and railways.
But the lack of funding keeps harassing his office while Joco's doing the urns again next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with cats, bows, and arrows, as well as other primary weapons.

"I saw Kante, I pushed my ball, and I just shot without much to think about it."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after naked on her Belgian star One Azar.
The "Blues" assailant passed a fifth to Mateo Kovačić, then sprinted from the middle of the field to the half of Liverpool.
Kovačič exchanged a quick double serving in the center.
Then I dropped a quick gunshot residue that led Azar into a clear position in the criminal field.
Azar ran out of defense and marked with his left leg at the far corner of Liverpool's doorman Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 this Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA League of Europe at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of deaths following the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency earlier Sunday.
Many people have been trapped in the ruins of buildings, due to an earthquake of 7.5, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves of height up to 20 feet, reports Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the news conference.
The town of Palu with over 380,000 people is surrounded by ruins of collapsed buildings.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue is becoming the newest memorial hit by "writing history"
Its ban will be a poetic justice for its nearly Taliban destruction of so many of English cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, “The Society of Cromwell” described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “foolishness” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in this debate to remove statues of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Palace to become a goal.
The iconocracy of English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of the actions of his forerunner Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent performance by Sir William Hamo Tornikroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of histography of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to defend parliament against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly identifiable person, which represents one side of the resulting division.
His achievements as a Lord protector also deserve a celebration and a celebration."
Murderer pig injures a deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his family as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near Liupanshui market in Guajjou province, reported on Sundays South China Morning Post.
Swinevud prepared to inject his pigs with vaccines in Sinin from Qinghai Province, China on 30 May 2005.
It is assumed that he arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and he also locked the door to the next feline open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the carriage with a blood clot.
Forensics has confirmed that the 550-pound pig has attacked the farmer lethally, the report said.
"My cousin's hand was bled and defiled," said Cousin Wu, quoted by Guyyang Evening News.
Security footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else while the police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that Yuan's family and market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death case.
Although rare, pigs have previously been reported attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked her wife and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, when the man was critically injured after the attack.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig was dragged by a Welsh farmer into his tractor while his wife was able to chase him down.
After an Oregon farmer had been eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer reported to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a ‘push’.
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they have no purpose in hurting anyone.
But one must treat them with respect," the man ends.
Losing Hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and torrential rains in the southwest of the United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cool waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooded rains in northern Mexico and the southwest parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane estimated at 5 a.m. in the morning of the east and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north during Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form a synclinal that is moving east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the coast of Baha California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to pour tropical moisture deep north into the southwest part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching synclinal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, carry debris streams and possible debris in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to precipitation from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unreasonable to travel whispers in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to dust and throbbing winds.
The approaching synclinal will lead to heavy rains in parts along the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach rainfall of more than half an inch, which will lead to small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rainy season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain reaches a larger zone on late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corner on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations in the United States while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a fine example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's about 20 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
In the majority of Central and Eastern United States, it is expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit from the southern plains to parts of the northeast expected to prevail.
The New York City temperature can reach up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watching Brett Cavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the attractive sighting of the testimony of the nominee of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanau and Christine Blacy Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 80s of the 20th century.
During that time, political opposition continued, as networks interrupted their regular return programmes in the last few minutes on Friday: an agreement that was negotiated by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, and according to which the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court that she was 100% convinced that Kavanau was drinking and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanau, in his emotion-free testimony, is absolutely certain that such a thing has not happened.
It is probably even more than the number of 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen to watch the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no directly available data on other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also traditionally suffers from difficulties in measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
To compare, we're talking about an audience similar to that of a championship football game or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanau's appointment, is first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, reported by Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office came out with a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanau, CNN and CBS cameras filmed on Friday how they whistled protestors trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During all the bullying for a few minutes, he didn't raise his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I am right here, standing in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he is presenting the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake replied that they had already come out of his office with a statement, and prior to closing the elevator doors, he said that he would speak further during the hearing by the committee.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided a massive live coverage a few hours later, when the Court had to decide whether to transfer Kavanau's nomination to the full voting Senate.
Ala Flake said he would only do so if he were sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which the opposition Democrats are insisting on.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the senator of the Democratic Party, Chris Queens.
After talking to Quans and a couple of Senator Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, since it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanau.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa Mae accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political plots" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May is arriving at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published by her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack against her so-called "Lady of the Lady" for Brexit, proposing that the collection of customs fees from Britain for the EU and vice versa was "fully absurd".
Murder of Wade Simms: Police arrest suspect Ditian Simpson for the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect for the final fatal shooting on Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, reported to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, reporting Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene, and they also found Simpson's DNA on them, reported from the CBS WAFB branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police have announced that he's confessed to a fatal shot at Wade.
His warranty is set at $350,000, notified by Advocate.
The Office of Forensic Medicine of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, indicating a gunshot wound affecting the head and neck as the cause of death.
The authorities express their gratitude to the Refugee Unit of the Louisiana State Police, the Police Criminal Laboratory, the Police of Southern University and the local residents for the assistance they received in the investigation, which contributed to the arrest.
LSU's Director of Athletic Sports, Joe Aleva, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
High 6 feet and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average in the last season has reached 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets of the game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade reported that the team was "crashed" and "shocked" after Wade's death.
Wade said that “this is something that worries a person all the time. ”
Vulcan sprays ash over Mexico City.
The ash dumped from the volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater has increased and 183 gas and ash discharges have been recorded within the last 24 hours.
The center has observed many tremors and tremors.
Published in social media photos show a thin layer of dust that covers the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City's neighborhoods, such as Hokimilko.
Geophysics have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since an earthquake with a Magnitude 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalun Separatists ahead of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors of independence faced the gendarmes when thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the secession of Catalonia.
A group of disguised separatists who were not allowed by the gendarmes began to freeze the keepers of peace with eggs and dust paint, creating dark and dust clouds on the streets that are usually clogged by tourists.
Later in the day, other feuds with the police arose, with police officers running to their batons to control the situation.
For hours the independent groups shouted "We do not forget, we do not forgive" while the declared integrity of the country was reversed with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the region's desired independence even a year after the October 1st referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatistly-set Catalans.
The vast majority voted for independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the conduct of the vote in the voting sections in the region with a number of violent clashes.
The wanted independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says that he no longer lacks hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now it seems we're in a jam," the man added.
Despite the significant victory, whether in small contrast, in the last December regional elections, the supporters of Catalusian independence experience difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-inflicted detention or are arrested in anticipation of the process due to their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Piogg, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone a protest in support of the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that "it's getting more tense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hungeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders awaiting a preliminary trial last year, announced that he would be running in the next year's European Parliament election.
He claims that "my candidate for the European elections is the best way to resist the regression of democratic values and the repression we see by the Spanish government".
Londonders: Arrested men after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested, respectively, after a car crashed several times into a house in Londonderi.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crecent Thursday around 19:30 British time.

It's also possible that the car was shot with an armadillo.
Goal of Menga brings Livingston victory 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won
The newbie in the High League Livingston surprised Rangers and caused only a second loss to Steven Gerard in his first 18 games as manager of the Abrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive, and Gary Holt's team lined up on points with the second in the Hiburnian ranking.
Gerard's team remains without winning a foreign field in the High League during this season, and next Sunday stands against leader Harts, leaving eight points in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has already been in a series of six games without losing the championship, and Manager Holt still hasn't felt the taste of loss since he moved to Kenny Miller's post last month.
Livingstone missed a good opportunity against the idless guests.
Holt's team had to lead the result far before scored a goal, and his direct style of play was extremely difficult, Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his blow went sideways, then Alan Litgow shot past the beam, after Craig Halket returned the ball to him.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing they could seriously trouble the guests of static situations.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingstone played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining each other and taking out Menga, who led his ball and scored from the middle of the criminal field.
Until now, Rangers had been in charge of the ball, but they had encountered the unbreakable protection of the hosts, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This game style continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' doorman saved Scott Pittman's foot, and Little's head shot past the door after another static situation for Livingstone.
The Livingstone penalized the center, which was easy to clean, and the judge twice disregarded the claims of the guests for sulking – first after the single-party between the Halket and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then, in doubt, for playing with the hand.
"Phenmental" by Livingstone – analysis
Alsdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on “Tony Macaroni Arena”
Phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays simply excellent, continuing to exceed expectations and improve its performance.
The style of the game and the composition have hardly changed since the team's return to the High League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he converted the team after his appointment.
He's got real heroes on the field.
Captain Halket was amazing, organizing the defense in an excellent way, while Menga was constantly holding Connor Goldson and Joe Warl under pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrate some great things, but in this case they were very much below these standards.
They lacked the last pass before the naked, once able to break the protection of the hosts – this loss must awaken the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan gets mixed up in Cologne.
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship cools due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU admission.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police prevented a 25-year-old crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but there were still many supporters who wanted to see their president around.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of whom Kurds, too, raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to allow it in the country.
The various protests reflect a rift caused by a visitor, which is considered a hero by some German Turks and is also despised as a despot by others.
Road crash in Deptford: The biker rests after a collision with a car
A biker died after a car collision in London.
The disaster became near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical aid arrived, but still the rider died on the spot.
The disaster took place several months after another rider died after being hit by an escape driver on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
The capital police have announced that her employees are working to identify the man, and will inform his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are off, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in a mutiny
Six prison guards were injured in a man's high security prison riot, reported by the Prisons Service.
The riot broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worchester at around 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to control it, special officers from the Tordano unit were called upon to deal with eight prisoners of liberty, the commotion itself in a limited to one prison wing.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to the faces and received medical attention on the ground.
A spokesman for the Prison Service made the following statement: “Special trained officials have been called to handle the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six overseers received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we strongly state that responsible persons will be handed over to the police, as their sentences may be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack on a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the riot troops were called to prison, where they could master a heavy riot in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with lightning flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although dry areas may benefit)
Arizona is rarely struck by a tropical storm, but it is likely to happen early next week, as the weakening hurricane Rosa travels through the desert in the southwest, risking lightning floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finland on Tuesday, with rain on late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “as of 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix! ”
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona's border".
The latest models from the National Center for Hurricanes provide 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rain possible in separate places.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rosa may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain is likely to be beneficial, as the southwestern part is currently in the land.
According to the US Land Observation Commission, a little over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second heavy category," reported fromweather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to the land of the Bahamas in Mexico.
Rose, which on Sunday morning can still boast at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Evgenia, Mexico, moving north 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over a portion of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of dowries.
"There are expected total rains from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora, possible up to 10 inches", reported from weather.com.
After that, Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah until Tuesday's late evening.
"The basic risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Center for Hurricanes warns.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Midsamer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for attempted murder · Global Voices
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old kid was found with stab wounds in Summerset.
The wounded boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsamer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is located in a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
At night in Radstock, a boy was arrested at 17 years of age, two boys at 18 and a 20-year-old man, reported to the police in Avon and Summerset.
The police are asking everyone who may have taken pictures of what happened to contact them.
Trump says Cavanaugh "has suffered from the insolence and anger" of the democratic party
"Every voice for Judge Kavanau is a voice that rejects the corrupt and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanau was "victimed by the wickedness and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kavanau testified to Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blacy Ford's charge of sexual assault decades ago at a time when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The president made a statement on Saturday that "Today the American people have witnessed Kavanau's intelligence, courage and quality."
"Every voice in support of Judge Kavanau is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service," the president said in front of a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly implied Kavanau's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican votes in general elections.
"It leaves five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I am not a candidate, in fact I am also involved," Trump continued.
"For this reason, I am running around and fighting for good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats had set themselves a mission "to obstruct and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanau's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to one of the senior representatives of the Republican party's CNN.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken from the shallow coastline by giant waves, when heavy earthquakes and tsunamis struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when at night the coastline was swept from waves of height up to six metres (18 feet), took many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami flew in after an earthquake with a 7.5 magnetid.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, which made many victims of the disaster," said during a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the spokesman of the Agency for Disaster Management of Indonesia's BNPB.
"The water was carrying cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything on its way," Nugroho continued and added that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed the trees and thus managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the Disaster Management Agency, photos from the air showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and paved bridges, as well as water-circled mosques.
The second tremors continued to swing the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a declaration that the energy released by the fifth massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of the long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the speaker added, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and damages could be higher along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the rabbit.
He also added that "communications are completely suspended and have no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross pointed out that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already gone to the affected zones.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was furiously criticised for not informing Palu Tsunami of the hit, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement of the message.
Social media-sharing amateur videos show a man on the top floor of a building who screams at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall plunges into the shore and deals with both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the video's authenticity in time.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe power failure, which has stopped communications around Palu and has made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, reported by the responsible authorities, but evacuees still desperately need food and other products of primary necessity.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pali on Sunday.
The victims of the Indonesian tsunami are now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala managed to reach Palu safely, where they found refuge in the tarpaulins scattered in their office's yard, they passed along a number of scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they'd seen countless houses destroyed."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the ongoing work on rescue and reconstruction operations by emergency groups, some complain that the vast experience of such situations is hindered by foreign rescue workers from reaching Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, financing, the dispatch of personnel and supplies from abroad can only begin if the site is declared a zone of national disaster.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at the regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there it has not yet been announced such a status."
While the second night falls over Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's National Paraplanes Team, trained two of the missing paraplanes for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As seniors in the paraplanetism field I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the Roa-Roa Hotel collapse reached the paraplaneism community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the racers in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, instead of a pair of blue notes, the only answer to his messages was a single grey one.
"I think this means that the messages are not delivered," he added.
Thieves raise $26,750 during a Newport ATM charge on Levi
On Friday morning, thieves picked up $26,750 from Brink's employee, who was loading an ATM in Newport Levy, became clear from a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the amusement complex and was getting ready to load it with money, writes Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “took near running behind the back of Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money.
The Witnesses noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the message continued, but the police did not indicate the number of people involved in the theft.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the suspects should contact the Newport police on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Yee.
Along with the announcement of a change in Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man, officially known as Kanye West”.
West, 41, had been wearing the nickname Ye for a while, and it was used as a title for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precipitates his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show, which has given up “for emotional reasons, ” tells us the creator of the show.
In addition to shortening his current professional title, West had previously claimed that the word had religious significance for him.
"I believe that "he" is the most frequently used word in the Bible, where it means "you" or "you", West said earlier this year, as he discussed the title of his album with the radio guide Big Boy.
"This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
You passed from Kanye, which means only one person, just Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence."
The rapper is one of the many known in his sphere who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the pseudonyms Love and Brothers Love.
One of West's former collaborators, J.Z., also presented himself in a version with or without tire and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The President of Mexico vows not to use an army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador swore that he would never use military force, as the country approached the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, Tlatelolco Plaza President López Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while student movements with left-wing political views were gradually spreading among Latin America.
López Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student scholarships and finding more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education draw young people to criminal gangs.
The US must double its funding for the development of the EDI
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the front of the development of artificial intelligence, the United States must double its research budget in this area, according to the researcher and developer of the IDI Kai-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various U.S. government departments made statements on the subject of the EDI, although the US generally does not have an official strategy for the EDI.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country is seeking to become number 1 from innovation in the EDI by 2030.
"The doubling of the EDI budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the US and are expected to make further breakthroughs with regard to the EDI," said Lee.
The doubling of funding can also double the chances of the next major FDI achievement coming from the US, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Powers of the IE: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest companies for FDI in China – Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Melon Lee worked on an EI system that won America's most successful suitor, followed by an executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee gives credit to the previous technological competitions of the federal government, for example the robotics competition of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asks when it will be the next one, which will help identify new visionaries.
"The US researchers often have to work hard to win funding from the government," said Lee.
"Not China takes academic leaders, but corporations," the man said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on FIs.
Lee also claims that changes in immigration policy can help the US strengthen its IT programme.
"I believe that science doctors should automatically offer green cards," the man said.
The US State Council announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other state organisations finance researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explains.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from industry and academia, and from the White House announced the creation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in developing the EDI.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislature, which had wanted to set up the National Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not observed any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change the name of their country
Citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the name of the state should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This is a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where an area called Macedonia exists, argues that its northern neighbour's name represents claims against its territorial integrity and therefore imposes a veto on its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change would undermine Macedonia's ethnic identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he himself would not vote in the referendum, while the campaign for boycotting him cast a shadow on whether the referendum would be able to reach the minimum 50 per cent required to recognise its validity.
The issue of the bulletins is as follows: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the formed after the break-up of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they could live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, sufficient members of parliament have said that they will comply with the outcome of the referendum to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of the parliamentary representatives must vote on this.
The State Election Commission reported that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 afternoon.
However, electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the urns.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Goose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene in 54 and arranged chairs in front of tents, which had been shut down by boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the servants' doors," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he released his own vote.
The statesman also said that the positive result would lead to "reinforcing the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies published results from a study that said between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in a referendum – which is under the required activity.
Another study, the case of Macedonian TV Telema, reported that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they'd vote 'Yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will represent the first serious blow against the pro-Western government policy since it won power last May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City goes through all defense of Brighton and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheim Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his naked in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalmaster was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenses from Brighton before he sprinted the ball into the empty space ahead.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He sneaked past one of the guards, then left the rest behind at the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with his right foot knocked over Brighton Matthew Ryan's doorman and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero is struggling with some injuries in his legs," City Manager Pep Guardiola reported to reporters.
"We planned it to play for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you scored a goal right now."
But Sterling was the one who secured the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match from the High League of England.
He signed up at 29 minutes.
In the situation for the naked Aguero, he received a deep hand in half of Brighton.
He immediately put a lead belt on the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Dream advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a belt on the far beam.
The attacker of the "heavenly blues" managed to get close, just before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in the match from the Champions League group phase at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play determine the fate of Rockies
Since the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, it doesn't make any sense to have another title-playing pitcher.
Still, the always-combated Sherzer hopes to be a titler Sunday against Colorado Rockies if the match is important to the Rockies that lead a single game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West ranking.
Rockies guaranteed to participate at least in the Wild Card after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain that they will win their first title in the division.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a nice match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will give their best to win perhaps the most important game for them during the year.
Why would I miss such a game?"
Nationals still haven't announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but they're supposed to let Sherzer participate if the game is decisive.
For Shercer this would be the 34th match as a starting pitcher this year, while he had a practice Thursday and would have a normal holiday time by Sunday.
Washington's right hand pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikers at 220 2/3 inning this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The president outlined the situation with his election to the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanau as he spoke of the importance of the republican votes in the general elections.
"In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also say that although I am not a candidate, I actually also participate, which is why I am fighting all the forces for the right candidates," Trump said.
Then he went on with “You all see this terrible, terrifying radical group of Democrats, seeing them with your own eyes.
They're determined to regain their power in any way, you're witnesses of their insecurities, of wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt who they have to run over to get involved in power and government because they're only interested in power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves a goal "to obstruct and obstruct".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the Democrats "wrong, ugly, mean and unfaithful".
The president reminded the Senate judicial committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feynstein by name, which has caused a strong cheers from the crowd.
"Remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I've been waiting – it was a really bad gesture – perhaps the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Leiberists are no longer wide open.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of the Labour Parliament so far, who was told that he was not welcome – just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment as he resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship is criticizing me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironicly similar to those with which Jeremy voiced disagreement in the days of previous leaders.
On Friday, the news of the meeting of the Liberians of Nottingham East said that “we want the meetings to include everyone and be beneficial. ”
For the most part of my eight years as a local representative of the Labourists in Parliament, Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of a "slower and measurable" policy have long been forgotten if they have ever been on the agenda.
It was becoming more and more evident that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion was judged on the basis of this how much the party leadership liked it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I had worked for before I thought they shared similar political views began to expect me to turn around and take positions with which I would never agree – either on national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I actually say – follows a whole insulting stand on social networks, where it is called for rejection, rejection of moderate politics, statements that I am not a Labourer.
Like that doesn't just happen to me.
As a matter of fact, I know that I even got more luck from some of my colleagues, since the comments about me are, at least, mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of these colleagues who face sexist or racist swings every day without fear of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how similar insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the liberals should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is far from wide open, with every sign of distrust or change in the rules of choice becoming more and more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received many counsel to keep quiet, not to talk so much, and then “all will be well. ”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labourists 32 years ago as a student provoked by the government of Thacher, which, by neglect, led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – either as an adviser at the local level or as a minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state is seeking Brexit, it will hurt households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy loyally to the leader of the Labourers.
But my message is not really to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the liberalists, or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threats of withdrawal or political exclusion will refuse me to act in the way I consider the best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Air led the ranking
The two late essays may have changed slightly the final score, but there's no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent High League game.
The team has already headed the ranking and the only of the ten teams is without a loss to the moment.
Better protection and better use of the opportunities were decisive in the game than coach Peter Merci and his team can be very pleased.
"I'm happy because the other teams tested us quite seriously in past games, and we're still without loss," said Merci.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: "Congratulations about Air have really taken advantage of their situation better than we have".
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frazier Klimo, carried Air forward in the result, but a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, released from the Waryers game, allowed Melrose to catch up as a result after Jason Baggott realized an essay followed by a failed extra punch.
Klimo increased the lead to Air from a criminal strike shortly before half-time, noting the essay after solo action, and then realizing the additional blow, which made the result 17-5 for Air of the holiday.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional hit on the Baggot, reduced the lead to only five points.
There was a prolonged interruption of the game due to the severe injury of Ruard Nott, who was taken to the stretcher, and after the renewal of the game Air increased their advance after the essay of Stafford McDoual and a successful additional blow to Klimo.
After that, Air Captain Blair Macferson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage, exerting strong pressure and implementing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional blow.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after taking down the Klimo without a ball, McFerson’s subsequent criminal act made an essay with the help of Air’s advanced offensive line.
Klimo realized the additional blow, not long after he did it again, after Kyle Row caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and pulled Gregor Henry's wing on the fifth essay of the hosts.
The star from Still Game seems to be heading towards a new career in the restaurant business
The star from Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to have directed towards a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, where he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two have announced that the coming ninth season will be the last to be broadcast, as Kiernan seems to have already planned his life after Craig.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan intended to join Glasgow's "beginning restaurant business".
“The sea is ours: Bolivia’s lack of escape hope that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the oculars with such a seaside headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag over the public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are lined with the motto: “Our sea belongs in law.
It's our duty to get it back."
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost outburst passed on to Chile after the bloody 19th century conflict, is still alive – as well as the call to sail again across the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest for decades now, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict from the international court on 1 October, after it has been five years of reflection.
"The force is in Bolivia, there is a sense of courage and unity everywhere, with the country expecting a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the verdict of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's demand and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to go to a disputed fight to re-election next year, has also staked much and much on the court's judgment on Monday.
"We are very close to getting our access back to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the possibility of the court making a decision in favour of Bolivia is quite small, and even if it judges in its favour, it would not change things in reality.
The Dutch UN body has no authority to take Chile's territory and has decided not to determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the last arguments indicates that the case “is not complex” echoes Paz Zaraté, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years might actually have hurt her.
"The problem of access to the ocean was broken up by the current government of Bolivia," Zarathe says.
Then he hinted that the military rhetoric of Morales had defiled and Chile's little goodwill remained.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after the normal dialogue has taken place.
Both countries have not maintained diplomatic missions to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open a page of a new era in its relationship with Chile", as well as a chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement by reaching both sides".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of access to the ocean as a "political path".
"Bolivia will never give up her right to go out on the Pacific," he added.
"Cension is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it will not continue with nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Young Ho says his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems on the edge to relaunch the nuclear-related stateless diplomacy more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un of North Korea.
Ri called "empty hope" the idea that continuing with US sanctions and objections to a declaration that would end the Korean war would make the North fall on its knees.
Washington is not willing to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture on the route of disarmament.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about abandoning their arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange the preparation of a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion reviews in Paris reveal the last peak on massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun's rays, you don't need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which fanned the fashion podium during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Quite impractical hats caused the Instagram wave in the summer, by the designers sending out eye-throwings of their creations to crush the community of fashion.
Valentino's bulging proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a similar wide periphery that literally absorbed the heads of the models.
The other too huge accessories included jewelry-painted dunes, a magic hat and even pineapple – but they have no purpose in keeping your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and recalled not so much of the higher fashion as for Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled diving equipment in a full set of snorkels and glasses while another looked like a melted fungi ice cream.
If you're into these fashion trends, you're lucky.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come shortly after "La Bomb" – the straw hat with two feet periphery, which was seen on the heads of everyone – from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult to the extremely impractical hat, which took over the social networks, led to the emergence of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as much as the wearer wears it with a swimsuit model.
The bag of raffia with the color of overheated orange, with raffia and a white leather handle, was attracted to all the views of the item in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus during the fashion week in Paris.
Celebrities columnist Luke Armitide told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer has made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for wholesale accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, which continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can put together and put into effect a personal training programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in his language, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's examinations, we see that languages are at the top with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages achieved a high grade of A.
The data collected by 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of students scored A in Chinese, with the same estimate as 72% of students studying German, 69% of students in French and 63% of those in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland accept foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice by students receive the same treatment as natural and mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) in the programmes of independent schools as well as beyond them.
A study carried out in 2014 by the UK Employment and Employment Committee showed that for reasons of difficulty employers found employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
As a result, the rule of foreign languages becomes mandatory for young people to prepare for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the management of a foreign language, which transforms these skills into essentials in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, since he has such a skill that remains for the rest of his life.
The opportunity to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling several languages on one's breasts before competition.
According to a study by YouGov, among more than 4,000 adult UK citizens in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, while the French language was the only language whose reign reached a two-digit percentage of 15%.
That is why investment in language learning today is important to children now.
Using several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ from taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country that needs to be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien only ferre.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for Lakers this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for the fans who are eager to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in the first game of the team's pre-season preparations against Denver Nuguets in San Diego.
But it still hasn't been specified how many minutes he'll play in the fight.
"It will be on the field between one and 48 minutes", declared Walton's joke on the official Lakers website.
The reporter for Lakers Mike Trudel announced in Tweeter that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of Lakers' pre-season training.
"At this stage of my career, I do not need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five planned rallys, which include stops in familiar places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying the confirmatory vote for its election to fill a place of freedom in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of a mandate, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress when voting in November.
At what time will Trump's rally in West Virginia be held tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00, east time this evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump will probably review this week's hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavano, in which there is tension over allegations of immoral sexual acts, which keeps the Senate's corroborative vote up to a week while an FBI investigation is under way.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
Therefore, President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five rallies next week aim to "activate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and start a campaign season full of commitments," Reuters told Trump's campaign spokesman, who refuses to be mentioned.
The rally tonight, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit to Western Virginia will be held, the state in which he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morris, who is behind in sociological research.
"It's not a good sign for Maurice that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research," said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Rider Bath 2018: The US team will fight for the last time, keeping its hopes alive before singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without intriguing "foursom" games on Sunday afternoon, they might have brought back what Ryder Bath needed.
Changing the advantage of sports is a rather subjective concept, in which players believe implicitly, even more in competitions like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They were six-pointed, and now there are only four, so I guess we've gained a little momentum," said Jordan Speed at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points at only 12 more for distribution.
As Speed says, however, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge the sports form of Speed and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each took three out of four possible points.
Speed shows an excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The enchanting festivities of the fans grew stronger as he progressed in the round, in which with a precise blow he leveled the score in the fourth match, after leaving with Thomas two strokes after the first two holes.
His stroke, which won the 15th hole match, was met with strong upheaval reactions that make us believe that really not everything is lost to the US team.
"It is important not to think about anything else and focus on your own game," Speed says.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spiet and Thomas in the last two days have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flintwood, the undisputed Ryder Bath heroes so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe, won four out of four, and they seem to get everything.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "rich" on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These successive successes, as well as the way in which they seemed to pass energy between them and enthusiastic fans, confirmed the view that they were the players who would win on Sunday and there would be no better couple than Fleetwood and Molinari, who would bring Europe's potential victory while the sun was setting over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the stories of European glory have proved a little premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson were quick to deal with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the "fourball" matches from morning till he partnered with Alex Noren.
"Gods" and two "dibles" of the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedes into problems they were unable to cope with.
But there's no way anyone else can solve your problems in Sunday's games.
"Fourball" and "foursom" games are extremely interesting to look closely for the interaction between the couples, the advice they share with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any time.
Europeans played better teamwork and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of the "foursm" games showed that the US team is also ready to fight until the last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, were highly doubtful.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the last day of Raider Bath.
Europe will have a solid lead before the last day of Raider Bath, after leading the United States with 10-6 after playing games in the "fourbol" and "foursom" formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Flintwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the inconvincible Tiger Woods, with which their asset in the Le Golf National race grew to four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy that lost to "Hazeltine" two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning "fourball" games over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and in the end Europe won the 3-1 series.
The United States was more resistance in the "foursom" games, where they won two victories, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points of the 12th single match on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flintwood was Europe's first recruit, won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known for the name Molliwood, then this sensational weekend became just the second couple, won four points of their first four games in the story of Ryder Cup.
After the unappealed Woods and Patrick Reid won the "fourball" games, they were extremely motivated to beat the broken Woods and American rookie Brison Decambu with an even more definite 5&4 score.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturdays, has only occasionally demonstrated the outbursts of his genius, but so far there have been 19 losses of 29 games in "fourball" and "foursom" games, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning "fourball" matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the "foursm" collisions in the 2–1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka – number one and number three respectively in the world.
However, Europe's team has failed to enjoy a fully pleasant, cool and cloudless day south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult victory with 2§1 against Spaniard John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" matches, and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory McElroy with 4&3 in the "fooursm" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Just twice in the history of Raider Bath, there has been a team to catch up with four points deficits before singles, and Furik's team regulation will keep the trophy even in equality.
However, after being overplayed in two consecutive days, their chances of turning on Sunday seem not particularly high.
North Korea says "no way" to disarm unilaterally, without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced to the UN on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepened mistrust of the United States and there is no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
The annual General Assembly of the World Organization Ri Yong-hou said that in the last year “significant measures of goodwill” have been taken, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear testing site and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under any circumstances there is no way to disarm one side at a time."
While Ri voiced North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "staged" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded, as it had taken step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant, since it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump gave guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has been pursuing an official end to the Korean War since 1950–1953, but from the United States it is said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for relief of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insist on "first removing nuclear weapons" and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal through coercion, and even object to "the declaration of the end of war", Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention whether it was planned to hold a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed during the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In in the last five months and added: "If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a standstill.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was much different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States was inevitable, after "the evil President" Trump called Kim "a man-rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at UN Trump, which last year threatened North Korea with "complete destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take measures to disarm, but said that much work was still to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea removed nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must necessarily continue until a complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is implemented."
The Security Council unanimously stepped up the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop the financing of the Phenyan nuclear programme and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri in the co-workers of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit meeting.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of having made "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to destroy a missile object and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" sought were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and that he wished to achieve a normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard on a sufficient rest course
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to overcome the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world often do not even think when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, prepared a course he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, "Why do they say that to me now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to the students the most about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the medical services of the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a dorm room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part of the participants talk about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke," added Professor Kaisler.
The culture of pride from "learning all night" still exists, he says and adds that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that deprivation of sleep is an increasing problem.
The provision of adequate and high-quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid filling, as the deprivation of sleep puts the brain in a mode of hunger, which causes them to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Keissler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says that his course “opened his eyes” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is all graduate students to be asked to complete such a curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaisler recommends that students consider whether to set up a bedtime alarm and wake up and know the harmful effects of “Blue Light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can upset the circus rhythm and cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: The Goal of Menga Crushed Gerard's Team · Global Voices
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's kick broke Stephen Gerard's idless team and won a 1-0 victory for Livingstone.
The team from Ibrox wanted to record his first victory as a guest of triumph in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team took only the second defeat of Gerard in his 18th game as a manager, which left his team eight points less than the distant Harts team, a leader in the High League of Ladbrokes.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the lack of constructive ideas by the Rangers team at no time seemed close to equalization.
After the Rangers match, they took sixth place, and Livingstone is already third, lagging from the second Hiburnian only in the head.
There may be additional problems for Rangers, as the later judge Calum Spence received a head injury after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team, which destroyed Air in the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same single member of Livingstone, who pulled a point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team paired up all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the rule of the ball, but Livingstone did better in rare cases when they owned it.
They had to point out the second minute that Menga pulled Scott Pittman against the doorman Alan McGagreger, but the half-protector missed a good opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs' centre of foul found Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense Alan Litgow pushed the ball away from the back beam.
Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything contained in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought he should have a dent in the 15th minute when he confronted Steven Lawless, but the referee Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian's claims.
Rangers took only two exact shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly handled the blow easily with the head of Lasana Kulibali and with the weak shot of these Easyria.
Although Livy's hit in the 34th minute was surprising with regard to the possession of the ball, it was fully deserved.
The Rangers have been unable to cope with Jacobs' deep-centred situation again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed it to Menga, for whom it was easy to implement.
Gerard reacted to the break by replacing the Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to the result when the wing passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingstone, however, continued to force guests to play in a comfortable home-style game, such as Lithgou and Halket constantly bounced forward long balls.
Holt's team could've increased its lead in the last few minutes, but McGregger managed to handle Jacobs' blow, and the next Corner, Lithgo, shot his head against the beam.
The guy who came in as the Glen Middleton Reserve from Rangers demanded a blow job at the end of the fight after fighting with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't see anything wrong with the situation again.
Yearbook: Geiger counter inventor
Page of our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day that the future physicist Johann Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of the device, known as a Geiger counter.
A cornerstone in science since then, the gaiger counter has also turned into a corner stone of pop culture when in 1950 the film "Coronado Bells" was released, in which the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
Man: “What in God’s name is this? ”
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium..
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “Surely shoots right now! ”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see ” foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient and their modification to the laboratory.
Then they can “see” protein, which is common to many cancers and reinject into the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that trained the immune system to identify foreign cells saw her ovaries cancer disappear in more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can “see” protein, common to many types of cancers called HER2, and then inject again into the patient.
According to Professor J. Berzofski of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Betseda, Maryland: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers”, including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and to ‘teaching’ them how to target cancer cells was used to treat leukaemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat that says, "Let's make America big again", with its participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was whistled at the studio during Saturday Night Live, after making a pointless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let Us Make America Great Again", he declared against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with the participation of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavana's testimony before the Senate Legal Commission for Complaints of Sexual Violence made by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's performance was uploaded to social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was put behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been hitchhiked!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming to wear Superman's suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
The comments sparked at least twice by whistles by the audience and the members of the SNL team seemed ashamed, Variety said, one of them said: "The entire studio shut up."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many by performing the song “I Love It” dressed as a bottle “Perier”.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "On one of the bravest: Thank you for playing past the crowd."
The head of the current show, Karen Hunter, however, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (as I buy music or dress or support his “art of art”) for whom I think he welcomes and distributes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, "now known officially as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he follows Deedy's example, also known as Puff Dedie, Puff and Paddy.
His friend, Rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lyon, and the musical legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
Charge for attempted murder after stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, the police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrate's Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be dealt with by the prosecution.
The star of Game and Throne Kit Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for the role of John Snow's swinging sword in the violent medieval fantasy series of the NGO Games on Thrones.
But the actor, who is 31 years old, objected to the stereotype of the cat hero, saying that displaying such roles on the screen leads young people often to think that they must be “serious” in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed that "something has gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married her partner at the "Game of Thrones" Rose Leslie, also at 31 years old, admits that she feels "very confident" that this problem needs to be solved.
"I am personally convinced at the moment – what have we confused about masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach loving men about the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television may in part be responsible for increasing the toxic masculinity due to many masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that drives boys feel they have to become this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the history or sequels of the "Game of Thrones" after the end of the show in the coming summer, claiming that he had "connected with the battlefields and horses".
Since November, Keith will play in Sam Shepherd's "True West", a story about the film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that getting to know his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and determined my life ahead," he said.
Rose is playing Ygrit, the girl where Keith John Snow's hero falls in love with the fantasy show, the winner of the Emmy Award.
Both married in June 2018 at Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820,000 people are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, said China's health services at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, each year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China is increasing by 100,000.
Passing HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGBT communities was widespread.
Studies have shown that 70-90% of men who have had sexual relations with men are ultimately married to women.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the government of China promised to provide universal access to drugs for HIV as part of its efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of senators' data from the Republican party, condemns "emerging lies" and "the theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, US Chamber of Representatives Maxine Waters ruled that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from the Republicans of the Wikipedia legislators' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that the claims were made by experts and sites on the "ultra right wing".
" Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during the Senate hearing about allegations of immoral sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanau.
The leak was realized after the three senators questioned Kavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of publications is related to Waters' office and has provided information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This groundless claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of my team — whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims — is by no means responsible for the leaking of this information.
This groundless claim is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including by former White House Spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"There's a poison in this denial," Fleischer wrote.
‘This implies that it does not have a temperament suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be challenging.
I shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction with the criticism of Judge Kavano's Democrats, who was accused by critics that he also seemed angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Indeed, if it is true," he wrote.
In his statement Waters said her office had looked at the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and will be held legally liable for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
"Johnny English breaks out again" review – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in any new film with British participation and it seems that this also applies to the revival of action-comedia, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and returned in 2011 with "Johnny English" returning.
Will the self-washing and the mimicking of how obvious we are to be stupid turn into a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has the privilege of renewing things for the second time, the name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a great comic design designed for cinema fans who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims for flattery, has little of Clouseau, little of Mr. Bean and much of the man who contributed with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, it is originally based on the leaving chaos after itself a traveler and an international man whom Atkinson plays in Barclaycard’s already forgotten TV commercials.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there's either two good times.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter carrying a medieval armor, and for a short while the wigs stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely redundant, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "mission impossible" include the dose of comedy.
Humour seems more like the children than the adults, and Johnny English's crazy accidents are not innovative and focused, as Actinson's game does not remind Mr. Bean.
It is always the current assumption that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhaker hacked the British supersecret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operative agents for the terror of the intelligence agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a puffy and pompous figure and is already suffering from a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives all of himself for this quasi-Tereza-Me role, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisors have informed her that she has to call a retired agent, as all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher at a chic center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons on how to be a undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English is summoned to Whitehall for emergency briefing and is reunited with his former longtime assistant, Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Because he's already a family man married to a submarine commander, a merry role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the great problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beautiful Ofelia Buletto, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the creepy Jason Walt, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farces: dressed as waiters, they set fire to the French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak on Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes a real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of Walt's house.
All the laughs are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so cute and violent, there are a lot more content here for children.
Quite mediocre production.
Just like in other movies about Johnny English, I keep thinking: can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that suits his talent?
The Leiberists deny that they are developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan for the British to work four weeks, but to get paid for five.
The party claims that it wants companies' bosses to provide the economies created by the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants the workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to receive the same payment.
Sources say the idea would "past" the economic programme and party plans to shake the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way to benefit workers from a changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an effort that is included in the approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this pursuit does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the liberals said, "The four-day working week is not the party's policy that is not considered by it."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the "unique directors" and "practices" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current owners of shares in water supply companies may not receive their entire share, as the Labour Government could impose “maintenances” on the basis of the violations found.
In addition, he confirmed plans to put workers on board companies and to set up privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of net capital to private firms to employees who could raise annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lyndsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 minutes ago" if the investigation of Cavanaugh by the FBI can change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Bret Kavano slowed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court with at least one week and raised the question whether the bureau's findings could make some of the Republican party senators withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent for "60 minutes" Scott Pelley asked the senators of the Republican party John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after this statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, firm and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Cavanaugh and to change it, it is necessary to press charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it firmly," Graham added, turning to Christine Blasse Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs an equally impressive mission: the elimination of poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will gather tens of thousands of people of the great morale in the Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but will also be familiar with the real purpose of the event – the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen festival launched in 2012 is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (except if you do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” as voluntary participation, sending no email to a world leader, phone call or other means of helping raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen 12 years before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to be convinced to require action or is it just another case of so-called "clickhism" – people think they are doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters, who insist on many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, already paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected some 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the "Food Force", established in the UK a partnership between investors and performers, engaging in "helping children to develop their full potential", which promises to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help put an end to malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 Twitter posts by "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into just a historical note," said food force ambassador Tracy Ulman in front of a live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government reported funding for a project, the Food Power, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the HRAs on his website, asking, "Why do you think we can end the extreme poverty?"
"Global citizen" replied: this will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and we will fail again.
But just like the big movement for civil rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, where Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman will lead.
US may use Navy forces to "block" and impede energy exports – the Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zink has revealed, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink claims that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is presented as a "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He intended to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuel," he said, while identifying Russia as a "pony with a single number", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with increasing the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project "North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, turns Berlin into "a hostage".
Moscow stressed several times that the pipeline for 11 billion dollars of the North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's burning opposition to the project has been motivated simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), urged the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take the presidential candidate seriously" in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take the presidential candidate seriously."
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry to the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was honest with her critics about Trump and his candidate for the Brett Cavanaugh Supreme Court.
On Twitter Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A sociological survey conducted on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should be run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be running, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported this candidacy.
The sociological survey showed more support for former Governor Dewal Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the democratic party discussed with regard to potential candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, said Associated Press.
Sarah Palin pointed out Trak Palin's PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump.
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the September recording.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident Monday night.
"What my own son passes through after he has returned is known to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with," she said in front of the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they return slightly changed, hardened, returned and wondered whether they would receive the respect that they themselves and their brothers in arms had given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of invulnerability, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasil Police Department.
18 state and district of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support the challenge of a new US policy, which refuses asylum to victims of gangsta and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18th states and the district filed a petition of goodwill in Washington to support asylum seekers and contesting politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Session case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal politics in August, has not been revealed.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of the cruel members of his band" abused her, but US officials rejected the application for asylum on July 20th.
She's being held in Texas.
State attorneys who assist Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum candidates in the United States come, as nations facing comprehensive gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy brought back the decision of the Immigration Board of Appeal of 2014, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Racine says in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined according to the specific facts and circumstances and such prohibition violates this principle," the good faith report said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that a policy that refuses to enter immigrants is harmful to the American economy, arguing that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary labour."
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Session ordered immigration judges to stop the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic harassment and gang violence.
"The shelter is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political belief," Sessionis said in his July 11th communication on politics.
The refuge has never been designed to alleviate all problems – not even all serious ones – that people face every day, all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double during the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick little boy into an evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
“An ambulance carries more corpses every minute.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been noticed returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals injured by the 7.5-magnet earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered a break in the spine and shoulder, were found outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly because of continuing secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he recalls how he felt the severe earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into the wrecked wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with the family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "tormosis" with "promotional advertising"
One week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in the US daily on the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press for spreading propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the elections for the US Congress on November 6th.
Trump's accusation that Pecky was trying to interfere with the American Congress election, noted what American officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in an increasing trade war in which import tariffs between countries are levelled.
According to US and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to strike exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's republican party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment in Des Moines Register's weekly number, "now doubles this harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China takes advantage of the respected tradition in America of freedom of speech and press, by putting a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at a newspaper stand down on the street here in Beijing you will find limited speeches and you will not see the true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people can have on China's disturbing economic outlook, given that the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He adds that ‘one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish’ his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kavano's beating, Republicans are pushing women's voters over the midterm elections, warning analysts
Since many of the top republicans are behind and defending the nominees for the Bret Kavano Supreme Court on several counts of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a response, in particular from women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
Emotions around the Tawa are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already noted that they wish to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be brought back," said Grant Raher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, in front of The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R- Arizona)'s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow or November," Karin Gene-Pierre, Senior Counsellor and National Speaker of the Progressive MoveOn Group said Friday, according to Washington's paper.
On Friday morning, protesting scandals "Neumvrey comes!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the judicial commission decided to proceed with the nomination of Cavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasieu Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rotenberg, a partyless political analyst, told the news.
"People say the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest that she can follow a retaliatory response if Republicans insist on confirmation of the candidacy.
"It became a big mess for the Republican party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavano is put on the bench. It is about the way the Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it," Gai Cecil, director of the U.S. priorities, said to the news channel, a group that helps to elect a Democrat.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on the question of who to believe in the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, a little more inclined to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent say that they believe Cavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate's judicial committee that Kavano attacked her in a state of invulnerability when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals before her while they were partying during her follow-up to Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Burners-Lee begins an experiment that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Burners-Lei Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lee, it is a joke that the intention behind Inrupt is a "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said regarding the beginning.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid technology that allows people to create their own “on-line repository of personal data” or ED.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through each browser, and at the same time all of them at the same time.
The unique in the online repository of personal data is that the user determines which information it has access to.
The company calls it "the giving of personal data powers."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills in order to help Solid become available to all.
At present, the company consists of Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who made a project contract, and a group of programmers volunteer.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are fully updated overnight.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission was to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
Over the past few months, Burners-Lee has had a strong influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Although Inrupt started, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest honored with the cross Victoria during World War I
They are celebrated 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest honored with Victoria's cross for his participation in hostilities during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he had been awarded the highest military honours of Britain.
A memorial was opened on Saturday by his two grandchildren, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" to discover the monument exactly 100 years from his grandfather's medal case.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy artillery and machine guns."
Later, he attacked the line of fire and with "surprising courage" led the building forward before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me calm. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set up a wreath after a parade led by "Brentwood Imperial Youth Band".
Michael Van said it was "a great honor for him to participate in the parade" and added "the valor of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be provided to many people."
The MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that all night long you are waiting to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you cannot become witnesses of the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 matches, including six of the main cards and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 p.m., just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in Britain was shocked when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they were building up early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fen described on Twitter the switching of the children's animation film as a "sick joke".
"The government regulates that at 6 p.m. this content is not appropriate, so the program was replaced by a child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications of Bellator, responding to the issue of broadcasting.
"Peppa pig," yes."
Bellator Scott Coker, president of the company, said they would work on planning meetings to include the audiences from UK in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Coker said.
"There is, however, six mornings on Sunday and there is no way to plan things so that the event will take place here on Sundays and there on Mondays.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't. He was a government.
I can promise you that next time this won't happen.
We're going to stick to the five matches instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to give more to the fans, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "lower" because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling less than anyone else because of his sexuality – but this motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started studying in high school, he did not realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be interested in less than winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent head of the long-term show, Christy Young, is in hospital for a few months.
In his participation in the first Lavern Daily program, he said that he felt "less" than everyone else while he was growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: “To this day the feeling of worthlessness and that I am different from others are actually the things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that it was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in the LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and wished to inhale “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was "stunned".
Daley married an Oscar carrier who was 20 years older than him last year, but claims that age difference has never been a problem.
"When you go through so much while you are so young" – he participated for the first time in the 14th Olympic Games, and his father died of cancer three years later," he said, "it's hard to find someone at your age who has experienced similar ups and downs."
The two became parents in June and had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself said that "his whole worldview" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named Robert's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games in London – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be next to me, Dad, or to the front row," he said.
"I held his hand until I stopped breathing and at that moment when I knew he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daily competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that all my life I had dreamed about it – jumping to the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – "Proud" by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still makes him feel better.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m., British Summer Time.
The lost form of Michelson remains at the Raider Bath on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Raider Bath, but he will have to regain his old form if he doesn't want his record tied to failure.
Michelson, who took part in a two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furik for "fourball" and "foursom" games on Saturday.
Instead of once again being the main figure in the US team, the five-time winner of big tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows from a distance, hoping to correct his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the top of his career has never been among the most legitimate players, is not in the optimal form for the difficult Le Golf National playground, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes any wrong blow.
And if the course itself is not disturbing enough, on Sunday's ninth match, Michelson will face the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who is teamed up with the newly-brother Tommy Flintwood and strives to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are down four points before the 12th single game, make a strong start, it might turn out that Michelson's game is absolutely crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, knocked me back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He is confident of himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and he's given as much in the past as he did this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing just two games.
I expected he'd play more, but it just worked out that way, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Michelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most games in the Raider Cup played on Sunday.
This may end his career at the Ryder Bath, which has never come closer to his impressive individual achievements.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven equal games, but Furik said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with people and he's a great person for each team," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than that just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, is aware that the great advance can soon be melted
Europe's team captain Thomas Bjorn knows from personal experience that the big lead, accumulated before the singles from the last day of Raider Bath, can easily be erased.
The Danish debuted in the game of "Valderrama" in 1997, when the team with Captain Sevé Ballisteros led five points in front of the Americans, but precisely at the final right he was almost caught and barely managed to hold the victory by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead on "Valderrama"; we also had a big lead on "Brookline", where we lost and on "Valderrama" we won, but very hard," Bjorn said after the 2018 European team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading with 10-6 on "Le Golf National:".
So the story has to show both me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Stand by for attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what needs to be done.
Nothing's over until you see the scoreboard's final score.
We have a goal, and she's trying to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I've been saying all this time that I think about only the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our rivals who are some of the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied by the performance of players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush into the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow in the foreground, individual performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you put all your capacity on the line as a golfer.
This is the message that must reach the players: tomorrow you must give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he must be distributed to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of rival Jim Furik will want his players to perform better individually than as partners, with exceptions being only Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas, who took three of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these great opposites on the last day – he was part of the triumph of "Brookline", and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans did the "The Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw on "Brookline", as well as on "Medinah".
When the advantage passes from one in the other direction, these mid-games are played under enormous tension.
So we formed our composition and distributed our boys as we would like to try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading our counterattack and facing Rory McCillroy in the most important match until Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I chose these players in this row because I think this gives us the best chance of success," Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
Germany postpones the launch of a new warship
The latest frigate of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the elderly warships since the Cold War, but this will not be implemented until at least next year due to the malfunctioning systems and the major rising costs, local media reported.
The introduction into the operation of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted the army spokesman as saying.
The vessel had to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class commissioned by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stelt technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates must be able to be used up to two years before returning to their home ports.
However, continuing delays mean that the vanguard warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power across the ocean – will already be old when they enter operations, Die Zeit notes.
The evil frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned the ship to the shipowner after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are particularly important, as vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be managed by crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older frigates of Bremen.
In addition, it was found that the ship was significantly overloaded, reducing its efficiency and limiting the ability of the Navy to add future superstructures.
It is believed that the 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germans during World War II.
Apart from defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including training of the crew – also becomes a problem.
It is believed that it has reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the original 2.2 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet is actually "exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said that the problem had become greater in time, as the old ships had been decommissioned, but no new ones had been provided.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Wuertemberg class could be included in the fleet.
The national trust follows the secret life of bats
A new survey carried out in a mansion in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
Hopes are that discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help guide future conservation actions.
Study by scientists from the Scottish National Trust will follow the common bats, as well as the brown shooters water lodges at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the callous sounds of bats, as well as which species produce them.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Duar, a natural conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work on habitat management, e.g. creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and Britain have generally declined significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities affecting their shelters and leading to the loss of habitats.
The risk for populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles to their flight pathways.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, accepts the bats very seriously.
Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special reserve for bats in the Threave mansion in the Dumphries and Galway region, which is home to eight of the ten bats in Scotland.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have great terrain for bats," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and completed suitable habitat.
But there are still many things about bats that are not known, so the work that we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He stressed that it was important to verify the presence of bats before property support activities were carried out, as it was possible that the involuntary destruction of an asylum could kill up to 400 female and young bats and destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, harass or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee at the Trust to protect bats, encourages society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what happens to their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects rape claims and his lawyers sue a German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo defined the allegations of rape against him as “false news, ” saying people“ want to become known, ” using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German journalist Der Spiegel magazine, which published these claims.
Portugal and Juventus' assailant was charged with raping American Catherine Majorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he then paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In Instagram video, addressing 142 million followers, several hours after the announcement of 33-year-old Ronaldo glued the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," the five-time gold ball bearer said in front of the camera.
"They want to become famous using my name.
That's normal.
They want to make my back popular, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for claims that call "an unacceptable publication of suspicions in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc said the football player will seek compensation for "moral damages in proportion to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football player's room where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that he was a "good boy" at "99%", but in the case he simply succumbed to "one percent".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extra-judicial agreement because she felt "feared of revenge" and was concerned not to be "publicly humiliated".
A 34-year-old woman says she wishes to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident Ronaldo was on the verge of joining the Real Madrid of Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain “will regret forever” that it has lost car manufacturers
Britain will "sorry forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of a delay in the border in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to job losses.
In the factory in Burnaston – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – nearly 150 000 cars were manufactured last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, says they're going to close their mini-model factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without a deal.
Toyota’s production line works on the principle of “accurate time” and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both from UK and from the EU for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be problems at the border, which the industry believes could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than one day to fill out their inventory at the Darbishher factory, said by the company, and therefore production will stop.
Mr Clark said Teresa May's "shahamat" plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to conclude the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"After the claims not only of Toyota, but of other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but in the longer term it warns that the additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Civalris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is founder of the union Unite in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “From my experience, I feel that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have set out an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed with another week" as the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano continues to fight, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential obstruction of justice by the President.
That whether Trump will fire the deputy chief prosecutor, or not, thus threaten Muller's independence, has been feeding the rumors of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him for Thursday.
Trump said that he would "prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's hearing, which was testified both to Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blazy Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of appeals against Cavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's speaker, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It is still not a date for this, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it may be postponed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I'm always trying to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would contest this statement: Sanders did not hold a press conference from the White House on September 10.
The head of the show, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason.
Sanders responded that the rare press conferences were not because of opposition to the "demonstrative behaviour" of television journalists, although he said: "I can't say I don't agree with the fact that they have demonstration behaviour."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continues, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, and you've been witnesses to practice it quite often over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press conferences, once you have the opportunity to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he comes out of the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with visiting seniors.
Self-contained press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and momentary strange behavior in front of the gatherers, journalists.
The Health Minister addressed EU workers to the National Health Service of Scotland with regard to the fears associated with Brexit
The Health Minister addressed the EU staff working at the National Health Service of Scotland in writing to express the country's appreciation and the desire to remain in their seats after Breksit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to the costs of established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions expected in this fall.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparation for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
So I would like to recall how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Members from across the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health services, which is beneficial for the patients and the communities to which we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would like you to stay here very much."
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he suffered head trauma.
Tennessee State Tigers Linebacker, Christian Abercrombie, underwent an emergency surgery after receiving head trauma during the Saturday meeting, when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee State's senior coach, Rod Reid, shared with reporters that the trauma happened just before half the time.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just passed out there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel submitted oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before it was placed on the stretcher and taken to the locker room for further examination.
Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/seriousness of the trauma yet", as well as that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher herb tax on real estate purchases in the UK
According to new plans by conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher herb tax on real estate purchases in the UK, with additional funds helping homeless people.
This move will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the German tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state Treasury expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher fee for the purchase of real estate in Britain, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the German tax will affect individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenues helping the government's efforts to limit the number of people who sleep on the street.
The addition – which is in addition to the current Herb Tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of surrender – may amount to up to three per cent.
The state Treasury expects to increase its revenues by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13% of the newly built buildings in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom citizens, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for first-time purchasers to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become "scrupulous cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy emerges only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the herb tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by looting land, but did not use it, and asked Ms. May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing in order to correct the "punishment with the homes" of Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including control of rents and the end of expulsions "no guilt".
He also wishes to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as a prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be with open doors for those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy as easily as the hardworking inhabitants of the UK.
For too many people the dream of having their own home has gone too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My goal is to lead the Scottish team"
Sunderland Manager Jack Ross said his career's "biggest ambition" was to be the senior coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottishman accepted the challenge to revive the club from northeastern England, currently in third place in the First League, at three points in the first place.
He went to Stadiom of Light this summer, after last season he took St. Miron back to the Scottish High League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a game for the B team and that was all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportssound.
"But I grew up with the matches of the Scottish Hamptons, which as a child we watched with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"This opportunity, however, would only be opened if I were successful at the club level."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sutherland's managers are names such as Dick Advocate David Moiss, Sam Alrdajs, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
Ala Atletik's former teacher said that he did not feel anxious as an heir to such established names in such a famous club, before he rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipsuich Town.
"For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because by structure, basis and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It won't be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I manage to get the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' training station.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miron from a falling team to a champion in Champianship in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his career as a football player in Clyde, Hartlipul, Folkrk, St. Miron and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really on the crossroad," he remembers the time he took Aloha.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best thing for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making good money, and I had some significant success.
But playing sometimes is hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel like being a manager is the right way for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin all my conscious life."

The perfect time for a beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals a study
The summer heat increased the earnings of surviving British pubs, but gained more tension for the chain restaurants.
The pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: “For the prolonged solar time and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup, a similar model was followed in July when the pubs reported growth by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and drinks bars reported the best results in their height compared to the downward movement of the restaurants.
Food pubs have also been affected by sunny weather, but not as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to come out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while food has a 3 per cent reduction."
Paul Newman, of RSM’s rest and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend that we noticed in late April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is no surprise that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although the decline in sales by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to the constant costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for food managers, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in the spread of the brands.
Cooper Peach Tracker, an analyst for sales in pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of more than 9 billion British pounds, and is an established indicator in the industry.
One in five children hides a secret profile from their parents in a social network
One in five children – some only 11 – has a secret profile in a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a survey
A study of 20,000 secondary school students showed the growth of false Insta pages
News has raised fears that material with sexual content is published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "core" profile showing their parents
One in five children – some in 11 – creates a social networking profile that keeps secrets from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students shows growth in fake Insta accounts – a link to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised fears that material with sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "core" profile that shows their parents and they also have secret profiles.
A mother who ran into the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager, which encouraged others to "rape him".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools revealed that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them recognizing that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot discover them."
Ailed Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the board of light athletics in Scotland
Elied Doyle was elected to join the Scottish Light Athletics Board as director of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete, and President Ian Beaty has identified this move as a great opportunity for those who lead in sports to take advantage of her rich experience internationally in the last decade.
"Elid enjoys great respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attraction," Byty said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the finals of the 200 and 400 metres of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, added to his four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I was struck.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a exhausting job, but I've achieved a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for encouraging messages!"
Advertising of breast-feeding pump, which compares mothers with cows, divide online opinions
A company that produces pumping for breast, split online opinions with advertising, which compares nursing mothers with cows that are breast-feeding.
In order to mark the placing on the market of the expected "first silent milk pump in the world suitable for carrying", consumer technology company Elvie launched a joking music-video commercial to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to breastfed babies to perform.
Four real mothers dance in a cow shop full of hay, in the background of a song with lyrics, including: “Yes, I do, but you don’t see any tails” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a vime, it’s my breasts.”
The singing goes on to say, "Smoke, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk your girlfriends."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, many of whom said that it was defamed by the "pangs" of the dairy industry.
"A very silly solution is to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them away a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The milk pump Elvie collects discreetly in a suckling bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is understandable that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast-feeding pump that can keep their babies?"
Another added: "So much inadequate advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, a woman admitted that she considered the song "extremely fun".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I was still feeding.
The excrement made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I accept it as it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a ridiculous advertisement directed at mothers who are sitting (often at their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like ‘ cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they danced with discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who are breast-feeding feel like cows.
Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, there are no wires or pipes and gather discreetly in a suckling bra that gives women the freedom to move, to keep their babies out and even to go out while they're sobering up.
Anna Balarin, a partner and Executive Creative Director in Mother commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
With the drawing of a parallel between breast-feeding and dairy cows, we wanted to focus attention on the draining of breast-feeding and all the challenges involved, while at the same time showing in a funny and understanding way the incredible feeling of freedom that would bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump gets into the leading news.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage for designer Martha Jakubovski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been smuggled into tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because harsh rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are immigrants without documents who are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to meet a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family should provide fingerprints, and these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wished to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
"Near 80 per cent of those who are either guardians, or are members of the family of guardians, reside illegally in the country, most of them being foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these persons," Albens said.
In an effort to deal more quickly with the registration of these children, authorities have required new rules which require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to the employees of the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not in person, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely it is to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to employees at the shelter and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern grew in large facilities, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child had problems were more likely to be neglected because of the scale of the place.
They added that moving the children to the “palatk city ” without giving them enough time to prepare at an emotional level or to say good - bye to their friends can make the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria Urges US, France, Turkey's "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been continuing for eight years.
Mualem, who also held the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign troops were illegally residing on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism and "to which they would take the necessary action".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without conditions," he said to the meeting.
Mualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost to the end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly evicted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian lands were cleansed" by both terrorist organizations and "every illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 Syrian military personnel who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian members, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the lands of a war-ravaged country.
With regard to the refugees, Mualem said that the conditions were bearable and could return, accusing “some Western countries that the ‘spoiling of insolent fears’ that incited the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate for these returns," he said.
"They are turning into a political issue something that is entirely a humanitarian issue."
The US and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last great fortress of the rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia over the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed at the jihadists, including fighters from the Al Nusra Al-Qaeda-related front, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Stafan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "the review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win second term
According to this logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal audiences are likely to hope, his presidency will not be suspended prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of the fatigue of the audience.
From 2014 onwards, the rating for speedtime has doubled to 1.05 million CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the broadcast, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops up at the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers in big news dinners.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama "Last Candidate", where it's told about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovel, who is a comedy veteran and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her cab driver said he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why? ”
Mrs. Skoval told me that he replied, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that is shown on television, Washington history can determine the future of Row vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Disfellowshipping is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to this at six hours to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses “deep historical information” as a source for his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s pilot jacket of ostrich skin for $15,000 (“Washington Post stuff”), and the shocking descriptions of Stormy Daniels about Mr. Trump’s anatomy.
I especially will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does to make you feel part of a reality show is to give you a little bit each night," said Brant Montgomery, the main executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", with regard to the changing participants and daily turnarounds (eating with the National Football League, praising Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be late.
When I contacted Mr. Flaiss this week, on the northern coast of Cauay was sunny, 80 degrees, but he was locked up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate's legal commission, and it depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr Flays told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments in the most disputed race in early elections for a place in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the reorganization of the districts of Congress and thus two principals for the same place.
Recently, the redistributed district in Pittsburgh suburbs indicates conservative Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in private elections last spring.
Lamb faces another titler, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who stands up significantly for the new 17th.
The maps were redrafted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaigns Commission (NRCC).
Lamb was famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely discussed private elections in March for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The position was taken by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.
US considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for supporting China, then withdrawing
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already admitted Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan any longer", Heather Nauru said earlier this month, a spokesman for the Department.
But sanctions were only provided against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in US aid from America for the fight against drugs, for development and economic aid.
The sanctions proposed, including cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the state of Central America with its unemployment and homicide rates.
With the progress of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at the security and economic well-being that serves for a similar gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior management authorities had clarified that their desire was for the conference to be held, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will participate in the mid-October conference as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
The three U.S. lawmakers have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in silence without any new severe reports or sanctions from Washington.
The White House speaker for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move may be the report by Special Adviser Robert Muller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, with the report currently providing substantial evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Mueller is directing his investigation to whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack against our elections.
If Congress leadership changes, it will prove that Mr Trump will have to report to this body when he is ready to stand before the voters, as well as perhaps before the jury, composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not imply that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his likes in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to make a state coup against Hitler, as long as the West stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the clan.
The course of history depends on such seductive moments, and the relentless march of democracy hastens or slows down.
The Americans are now facing a few of these traps.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble ever since this paper said that last year he had proposed to secretly write down the president and speculated with the opinion that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein has announced that the history of the Times is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Bret Kavano requested by the FBI is not complete or fair – or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if it forces Mr Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy awaits her in the long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fail because I've learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the shabbat candles on that table carrying swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, Senior Fellow of the Brookings Institute, is the chairman of "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", and is the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about dealing with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosts of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that victory over Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward with Group G of the League of Europe.
The knee injury did not allow half-protector Graham Dorans to play his first match for the season before the 2-2 equality in question with Villareal, but he believed that for Rangers this result could become a springboard for greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," said 31-year-old football player.
"We went into the game with the hope that we could win something and left with a dot.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but in general, equality seems fair.
They were better in the first half, and we – in the second half.
We've taken a look at Thursday, another big night from our matches in Europe.
I hope that we can fight over the three points, this will be a difficult game, because they have achieved a good result in the past meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened around my injuries and the changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, the training is beneficial.
I hope that we will be able to make every effort to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women are worried about fear of their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people are discussing this with family members.
About half of the participants in the study of Nationwide share that they discussed with their husbands the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent spoke to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but have not taken steps to hold this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Together with your advisor and your family, discuss where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with the idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions, when choosing a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your means – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with the legal battles from the beginning.
Appoint a health care officer so that you have a certain trustee to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals conform to your wishes, in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a Financial Commissioner.
You can choose a trusted person to make the financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs emergency medical care and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Put these details in writing so you can be prepared.
"It is not only about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors will be," said Martin.
‘What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

The victim failed to see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to draw witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities announced, expecting the number of dead to grow.
Due to the interrupted communications, the support organisations cannot obtain information from the Dongala regent, an area north of Palu, which is located closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulavesi province, located at the end of a narrow beach line on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami hit it.
Dongala is a regent that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of the island of Sulavesi.
The Agency, which is an administrative region smaller than the Province, has an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of central Sulavesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovov, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times since the tsunami in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, tsunami kills more than 200 people and destroys hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami invaded the western part of Dongala and in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is on the Seismic "Pacific Fire Ring" and is regularly consumed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26th on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra activated a tsunami wave that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-magnitude Rabbit has scuttled the most populous island in Indonesia, Java, triggering the tsunami, which broke down on the southern coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: Earthquake with a magnitude 7.6 hits near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the islands of Mentawa and activated a ten-foot tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Paddy Jaya Regent in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, tsunamis are not activated, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes have plagued the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of whom on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in a wasteland.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Trak Paylin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice president's candidate, Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Paylin, a 29-year-old, from Wassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the state police in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a woman - sex woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Paylin is detained in the pre-detainment building of Mat-Su and under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, certainly", when he was asked to plead, the media reported.
Paileen is threatened by the penalty of three class A misdemeanours, which means he can be deprived of liberty for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with a class B felony, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paylin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently being examined by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he punched her with a fist in her face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior with post-traumatic stress arising from his ministry in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds have died
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks have been interrupted, with the number of dead expected to grow in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulavezi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
The social media are making videos that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami wave hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for a suspect in a New York terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors from New York want the death penalty for Syfulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack, in which eight people died -- a rare common punishment that has not been carried out in the state of federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, at the age of 30, was using a rental truck at Home Depot to carry out the attack in October of a biker near the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, footpaths and cyclists on their way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused severe bodily injuries, according to a notice of intent on the death penalty claim filed in South District, New York.
According to the court, both charges can end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal court handed over 22 counts of indictment to Saipov, including eight counts of murder related to a racket used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of the IPU.
The attack required "serious planning and deliberateness", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov performed as "fearful, cruel and perverted".
"Sifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Larry Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Felucci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the announcement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South of New York is looking for a death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in New York on a federal case was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek national, showed no sense of repentance during the days and months after the assassination, according to the judicial documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching IDIL's videos on his phone, claiming the indictment.
He also asked his hospital room to set up the flag of IDIL, shared with the police.
He pleads guilty to the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of a sentence of guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all those affected," Patton said.
The team for Saipov's defense had previously asked the D.A. not to ask for a death sentence.
Conservative Parliament says Najjjul Faraj needs to lead the Brekzit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilise the army of the people" today, during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "remember the pressure" – as one of the members of Teresa May's own party, suggested he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservatives, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have come out by now", if Mr Farage had been Secretary of the Brexit Affairs.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to agree with the deeply divided ranks of the party was highlighted by conservatives supporting the stay, who joined in a separate protest against Brexith in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromise plan "Chequers", despite the attacks by supporters of Brexit, who support the rest of the EU as well.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and liberalists choose between its package and the "Haosa".
Mr. Bone told the protesters with the slogan "Going out means going out" in Solel that he wanted to "drop out the Chequers".
He stated that Mr Farage had to participate equally with the others and that he had to be held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
The deputy from Wellingborough added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw away the Chequers plan.
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be plentiful.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The notion that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely incorrect".
Conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, sharing with reporters: “I just say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually went out on the street and actually helped us be chosen.
Please leave "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “Premiers keep their position when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should "remember the pressure" if they intend to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"It is now about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Brexith and we're gathered here today to say, "We're not going to let this get away with you."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the edge to change Brexit, feel pressure.
"We mobilise the army of the people of this country, which helped us win in Brexith, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-ruled, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters passed the march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Shep activists were picking up flags with "Conservatives against Brexit", after the group started this weekend.
Leiberist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives about the security issues of the party's application when he opened up at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can deploy the IT systems and all the technology of Canada and yet, for an unhindered border crossing, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren says he'll "consider seriously" his presidential bid
State Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would "consider seriously the opportunity to run for president" after the November elections.
Boston Gloub reported that the representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a town council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will be running for re-election in November against Republicans' representative Jeff Dill, who was co-chaired by Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the heart of speculation that it can take Trump's post in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon in Holiouk was the 36th meeting with voters in the town hall after Trump took office.
One of the audience asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it is high time that “the women go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women at the top.”
He was arrested for the death of Simms from the LSU.
Batton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect in the shooting on Friday, when basketball player Wade Simms was killed by the LSU.
Baton Rouge's police office reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 a.m. east time.
They posted a video from the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man who was seen on the footage.
Simms, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told before the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without problem and detained in the custody of the Police Department of the Municipality of East Baton Rouge.
Young people 6′′′, grew up in Baton Rouge – Sims participated in 32 games with 10 exits as titler last season and recorded on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 fights at the match.
Grand Prix of Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer and closer to the world title, after his team's instructions helped to beat Sebastian Fetel
From the moment Walter Botas was ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, allowing Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fettel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next tour and came out after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat him down after a bold maneuver and drive a "gum to rubber", which forced Ferrari's pilot to reluctantly release the inside of the track to avoid punishment with added time, after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double defensive maneuver on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday Max Verstapen started off from the back lines of the starting grid and was seven after the end of the first tour.
After that, he even led a rather long period of the race, since he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly beat Kimi Rakonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered the pit-stop in the 44th lap, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and in the end Rikonen finished fourth.
It's been a tough day since Walter did a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me beat him.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first two seats on the podium," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feynstein at the rally on Saturday for her claim that she had not distributed the letter from Christine Blazy Ford, who accused the complainant of the Brett Cavanaugh Supreme Court of sexual harassment.
During the rally talk in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's legal commission, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and disgusting and honest".
"What can happen also the good that has happened in the Senate for the last few days when you see anger when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting and unkind," he said.
"When you look at the publications and the distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You know what I mean?
Diane Finestein, did you spread it out?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't distributed."
Well, hold on a second.
Did we distribute... no, we didn't distribute," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford's claims against Cavanaugh in July, which was circulated earlier in September – but Finestein denied that this spread had happened from her office.
"I didn't cover up Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Feynstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep my confidentiality, and I kept my confidentiality as she wished."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's claim, accused of sexual crimes against three women, the President pointed out that the Democrats were using claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power with all possible means.
See the dishonor, shamelessness, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to run over to regain their power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars returned for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants took early to the game with two goals after the beatings of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawney lined up for the hostess before Dwyer reinstated the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bushard leveled for Dundee before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for Adam Keef's boys who got out of the bottom to win Dundee in Belfast on a 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth fight between the opponents this season, when the Giants won the previous three games.
The blow that Dwyer found the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m. with Kendall McFaul's assistance, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance by assisting Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level with the Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer tried to take the Giants before the first break by scored a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped, and Bushar leveled again the chances of a powerful blow in the door at 27:37.
Cawney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the first prize for this match at the end of the second half, and he gave all of himself and confirmed the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who lost the last four matches of a total of five meetings, met like the Milton Keynes hostess for their next game on Friday.
The pilot died to make sure hundreds of people aboard a plane could escape an earthquake.
The leader of flights in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulavesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
The strong secondary tremors continued to defeat the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the town of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly shaking control tower at Mutira Sis Al-Juhry Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway at that time, would manage to fly out safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Control spokesman Indonesia, Johannes Sirajt, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about this," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announces that access to the cities of Dongala, Siggy and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the debris and many people cannot be reached," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance carries more bodies every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There are marauders everywhere in the minimarkets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The red cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widododo arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was plagued by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Now Air Niugini reports that a man is unknown after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean now reported that a man had been declared missing after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated by the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that Saturday afternoon they could not contact a male passenger.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airlines and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane passed the runway.
The American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane was getting very low.
"This is very nice," says Janes.
Janes tells us that he and the others managed to run through the deep water to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing the harbor nearby also helped in the rescue operation by using an inflatable boat to get people off the coast before the plane sinks into the deep about 30 meters of water (100 feet).
Data from the Safe Air Network indicate that in the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposed the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor's office ended this Saturday in a retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulet of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulet said he had received data on the location of several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, back to his previous allegations, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to question Sanferd.
Sanford was brought to court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanferd's truck that night, Sanferd said that "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate that they've only known each other for a week.
Roulet pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he erased text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He saved her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is planned to begin with its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the judges later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscience hip-hop?
Hip-hop Trio wants to trigger negative opinions about the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that the hip-hop has deviated from its origins of political statements and engagement with social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and popularize the conscience hip-hop again.
The Fugees and Commons performers are reborn in the UK by performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A New York nanny is suing a couple after firing for a "racist" message.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal because of discrimination after receiving a wrong message from the mother, who complains that she is a "other black".
The couple deny being racist, resembling a want for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was ridiculed when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEE, ANNOUNCER," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing her mistake, the unfortunate woman, Plasco-Flaxman, fired Mrs Morris, stating that the former African-American nanny was not doing the job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris received a salary for a work day after she was sent home with a cab.
Now Morris is suing the couple for the dismissal, asking for the $350 a day for the six-month arrangement for which she was originally hired, although she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that," she told Post on Friday, adding "I'm sure it's discrimination".
In response to a request, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that the termination of Morris's employment was a reasonable act because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it was wrong?
You're the newborn?
Imagine that."
Plasko claims that his wife was only born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Will you attack anyone in this condition?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks, rebutting them for their conduct and logic.
Paddington publishers were concerned that readers would not feel connected to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted by the audience, relates: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny now that we're aware of Paddington's tremendous success."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book as a little bear toy, would feel optimistic about eventually rejecting the book, adding that he had welcomed the 60th anniversary of publishing the book "with mixed feelings", after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she described as “an important member of our family, ” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self-sufficient," she said.
“But since Paddington felt so real, it’s like having a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your business.
I think you kind of accepted Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merit of Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Up kept ringing to say that the situation is really bad that it does not expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperus.
"Then Nad called me to say that he would die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicines given to her by the doctors to support her heart slow down and leave her system.
She's gone a while before that, and that's how it ended.
I should've just sat there and waited, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I'm supposed to be tight."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far mourned the loss of her daughter, has boarded the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the trial she's going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I would wrap my head around and my tears would drip all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of complicity with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Disturbing women put in cards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help on.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said..
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by the smile.
They've always said that his smile shines every room."
However, he gave up his work before leaving, and he was in “a truly dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that this will have any consequences."
“ So that people know that they have someone to go to and talk to, even if they are a friend, ” says Mrs. Davies.
Don't keep quiet – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, loses Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their gifts, he looked at them neither, nor at anything."
She said that this was a terrible injury to them, but they had to cope: “This opens up a void in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must move on and fight."
If you are trying to cope, you can contact the Samaritans of 116 123 (for UK and Ireland), send an email to jo@samaritans.org or visit the Samaritans' website here.
Brett Cavanaugh's future is in question after the FBI launches an investigation.
I was wondering if we can really achieve what he wants – an investigation with limited duration and limited scope – maybe we can unite our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee "decreased" despite a hard-core blockage.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their wish is for the moment.
The early elections are only five weeks later, on 6 November – if Republicans are not expected to be well represented, their attempts to elect their representative at the highest court in the country will be seriously affected.
George W. Bush calls the senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help meets his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has prepared its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where members are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that will allow Vice President Mike Penz to declare equality and confirm his application for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees "decreasing" at Kim
The South Korean legislator claims that the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Beeong Soug Park, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts requested by human smugglers, are key factors.
No official comment from Pyongyang.
Most of the North refugees eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is technically still at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the Heads of State of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stagnation in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work generally for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused the US of failing to make progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be sure of our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was not suitable for service at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in Congress, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano 's 'hysterical' and said he was too nervous to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I had no way of thinking that if a woman had reacted in this way they would have called her "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavano's testimony before the Senate's legal commission on Thursday.
Kavano emotionally rejected the allegations that he committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Cavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he almost screamed and felt when he was discussing his family and his school years.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack against the person", organised by liberals who are dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi pointed out that Kavano's testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because it became clear that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these claims and with the way he pursues the Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied it when she was asked if she would try to discredit Cavanaugh if he was appointed and if the Democrats received a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I will say so – if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is unable not only to enter the Supreme Court, but also in the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavano's potential decisions in relation to the Law on Access to Health Care or the Row v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Cavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to enter the court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it great,' Pelosi concluded.
And women have to master themselves.
It's a reasonable criticism, after months and years of spreading rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Ms. Steinum told me 45 years later.
"I don't consider it unusual, do you?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive director somewhere who said that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she said to her interviewer, “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought it was genius."
Tears are allowed to express anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of the brightest memories of my previous job, in the office mostly with men, is how once, while I was snooping with unfathomable rage, a woman older than me grabbed me by the door – a chilling manager, which I have always been a little afraid of – and she dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to do it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship with a yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well thought out solution," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they wanted to happen was another one to appear.
Someone called the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Since she's late for the campaign, she's running out of funds and decides she won't stay in the race if she doesn't get $2 million.
The battle is predestined to fail.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, which states that she will not continue with an official campaign, she is overwhelmed by so much feeling – thanks to the people who supported her, discontent against the system, which makes it so difficult to raise money and to turn to the voters, not to the delegates, as well as anger against sexism, that she has felt.
"A man may think I've had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder remembers how the media reacted.
"Someone may think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"She's crying?"
How the US-China trade war can serve Beijing
The first shots in the US-China trade war were deafening and, while the battle is still gaining speed, a break between the two countries will bring Beijing's benefit in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning crowd this year, charging with taxes key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation of the tension occurred this week with new duties affecting the production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Every time Beijing returned with a new bribe with five to ten percent of US goods for 60 billion US dollars.
China has agreed to respond to every blow to the United States, and soon it is not expected that the second largest world economy will ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to submit to the demands, but to keep his head public in Washington would be too embarrassing for CJingpin, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing played its cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war could help China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that an accelerated political solution, both in Washington and Beijing, can create conditions for an economic crisis in either of the two countries, is actually more dangerous than observers have recognised before," said Abigail Grace, a scientific collaborator on issues related to Asia to the expert group Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister said
Syria announced that it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asked for assistance in restoring the country devastated by the war for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem stressed that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas ravaged by terrorists in order to restore them to their normal condition.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and nutrition.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins Raider Bath in Paris
The team of Europe won "Raider Bath" for 2018 and topped the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on "Le Golf National" in the outskirts of Paris, France.
Thus, the US has six consecutive losses on European land and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the championship crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Michelson, who presented himself weakly during most of the tournament, threw his first punch on the 16th hole (with a "par" 3) in the water, losing his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari presented himself well in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching a balance of 5-0-0, since the race took place in the current format since 1979.
The American Jordan Speed lost a 5+4 facet from the team of Europe, which is the lowest in the ranking – Torbourn Olesen from Denmark.
The leader of the world ranking Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Potter from England, for whom this is probably the last part of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participants in the Raider Cup, became the European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, with this year he raised his assets to 25.5 points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't hold back.
It's been a rough year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
In all things, the team is most important and I am happy that I was able to help," the excited Garcia shared after winning Europe.
He's handing over the barn to his compatriot John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2–1 singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four games in France and his overall balance of Ryder Cup is already 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, won 14 major titles – a indicator that only gives up to Jack Niklaus.
The US team experienced difficulties all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who showed high-class golf in all the days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick shared after the disappointing performance of the team: “I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point, we pressed the team of Europe this morning.
There was a battle.
I'm putting my hat on Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players were very good.
We'll regroup, discuss the important issues with the Association of Professional Golfers of the United States and our Raider Bath Committee and look forward.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can take off your opponent's hat.
We were just being played."
