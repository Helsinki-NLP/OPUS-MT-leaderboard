The Prague Stock Exchange went down to the end of trading
After the early collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares have reached almost half of normal daily trade.
From the start of Tuesday’s trading to its Monday’s collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange began to fall by almost six percent.
This time behind the decline is the collapse of shares on Wall Street.
In this way, we also have a market reaction to the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Stockfall in Asia
The dramatic decline on Tuesday experienced stock exchange in Asia, although the indices eventually erased some losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index in Hong Kong wrote down almost four percent during trading, but later part of the loss deleted and reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stock movements at the Hong Kong stock exchange, dropped by 3.8 percent, markets were closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but in the end the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange dropped by 3.6 percent, according to the Thai-wan index.
"The timing of the rescue action in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," noted the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines monetary policy separately, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should speedily return to the negotiations and propose approval of support for the financial system.
Otherwise, they are threatening to feel the effects of other countries.
Blood spa American shares
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected a plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (about 12 trillion CZK) was to be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
American stock on Monday experienced a bloody spa and the main stock index recorded the biggest decline in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost seven percent and the decline to a similar extent was last observed in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the motion in the Chamber had not passed, the index was found to be in a free fall.
Congress resigned: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a wider form of the US Financial Assistance Agreement.
The vote will begin next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in talks on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must complete certain details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, this was told to Reuters by Barney Frank, chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee.
In the Senate, according to sources, the plan could probably be voted on Wednesday first.
According to economists, the notification that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
But then there will be a "warming" due to the complexity of the mechanisms that help markets to achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our divergent views on how the package is to look like to stabilise the market," said Democratic Nancy Pelosi for Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met on Sunday night with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy out from financial companies the non-marketable mortgage assets that bring financial companies into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
There's still a healing plan to continue, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to the Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where decisions by Congress could affect Monday's trade.
However, it is not yet certain when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor is it possible for them to bind themselves at the last minute to any problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, is still aware of a number of changes.
The total amount intended for the assistance of the system shall be divided into two parts.
Initial $350 billion should be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program does not fulfil its function, in addition to another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush assessed the progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, the Congress may vote for it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funding for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has failed because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay off their mortgages, has been preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush is satisfied with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, stated that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates the "buying effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate of Christopher Doddd, the moderator, said that the legislators had agreed on liability for the monetary programme, protection of taxpayers from losses, closure of benefits, timing of financing the plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called golden parachutes for the directors of the company participating in the programme and set up a committee which will have oversight over the fund.
He should run the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with help for homeowners who have problems with paying.
The government should negotiate new payments for mortgages it buys to reduce the monthly payment costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist Patria Finance David Mark, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that is because it is not known what mechanism and at what cost problem assets will be redeemed.
It will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government split up between each other," said the iHNed.cz Marek server this week.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of the next week, it is not so important according to Mark.
"It is much more important that the Congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that it will be dedicated as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement that will be approved is the most important at this time," said Marek.
Blade knife match: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We'll tell you how to choose.
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
That makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons for one to have a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the use and the demands of the future owner.
It's probably hard to get a top-of-the-line gramophone home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
However, such music products on LP boards do not come out and there is no objective reason to do so from a qualitative point of view.
However, if you have been guilty of art rock, jazz or blues in your regattas, you will likely be dreaming of such a phonograph at least.
It's the same with the music on the roads, i.e. the music that's compressed, simplistically - the music in MP3.
Price and quality categories exist here too.
For someone it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as a Pink Floyd fan, it may be difficult to test headphones for 20 crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides how long the battery is.
Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than just play music, but what most phones do or happen.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone calls and texting, she can play music and video, both record, she's got a better camera, and maybe she can navigate.
And if we take smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can barbecue, and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest power surges.
A small cell phone can play music for more than ten twelve hours, usually it's much less.
Music players (especially the easiest ones) are significantly more powerful in this regard.
So for cheap phones, you should count on them not playing you for more than a few hours.
If you're still here and you call there, get another charger to work for sure, that's also true for more expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even worse will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation per charge.
Another problem arises when you upload music into your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be connected directly to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few of the card readers are able to handle the miniature memory cards that are used on their mobile phones.
You do not need any special software for players up to the exception (iPod).
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most of the mobile phones and players will themselves create a music library by the name of an interpreter, the name of an album, a genre or a user rating.
Some devices display only a tree folder structure similar to the Windows Explorer and some can both (irivar, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players work hard, mobile phones know more
When selecting a particular device, be particularly interested in the endurance of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and of course also the comfort of control.
If your music is primarily a scene and if you listen to it every day just briefly in a tram, you will need any cell phone that will play MP3.
Which already can really almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch too much the music formats your cell phones or your player can.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread and besides it the vast majority of instruments can also play in the WMA format.
Less there is an AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow for example the purchase of online music.
Just visit the operator’s relevant website (or other provider) via mobile Internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a valid argument in itself for the acquisition of a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and is mostly limited to fast-winded radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this method of selling music (whether via the GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will eventually be controlled by the music industry.
Most people's cell phones are still on their own.
Whenever you get the urge to listen to something, you pack your cell phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
Still, it is important that you also carry headphones or at least wire hands.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker, which has almost every cell phone, but only a minimum MP3 player.
Probably the biggest benefit of musical phones will be for a lot of price.
The cheapest is normally worth under 3,000.
In three and four thousand crowns, you will already have a very decent walkman.
Most of you, however, will be limited by the absence of an exit to regular headphones.
The best and technically most sophisticated phones even with a 3.5 mm bitch for regular headphones cost up to 15 thousand.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy to operate.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - the player can control really everyone.
Minimum functions, similar control with an earlier ordinary tape recorder or, for example, a turntable is obvious.
No conflict in the form of an on-line mobile internet and then a huge data transfer account.
What device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for replacement memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card you will join two thousand crowns.
Be careful, though.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the dearest can deal with 8 GB memoirs.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy yet another cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, please reach out to the specialized phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is closer to a separate MP3 player.
It is also in Sony Ericsson, whose walkman phones have identical user interfaces as self-sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand kroner, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (up to 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will be awarded to you MP3 players from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here -- a virtual operator who would make the classics slow down.
Maybe it won't be long.
About the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobile.cz many times already.
Finally, the Czech Republic also confirmed this, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher for us than for the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be paradoxical situations - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that would really want to fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we've got three mobile networks and penetrations over 100 percent.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to joke that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, the President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with its own network has probably not had too many chances (although, it probably would have been hard to find frequencies already).
But there's another possibility, a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought significant reductions in prices, which the classic operators had to respond to.
By the time we entered the labels such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to ours were heard in the UK.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year, we informed you of the launch of virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to get over 100,000 customers and become the fifth biggest operator there.
Meanwhile, the financial group Penta is behind Mobilking, which owns U:phone in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is that it is possible to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than the classic operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators tend to profile themselves as low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a more efficient offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers a text at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move and a bet on an unscrupulous target group.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"The right men elect Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like that in Poland could catch up with us.
It is questioned by the press spokesman Vodafón Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, in terms of service supply, it is relatively satitated."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, they say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, negotiations do not seem very promising.
Rather, there will be the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," she said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studnicková, a press spokesman for the financial group Penta.
It indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not in favour of this idea.
Rather, he tries to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor emerges.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator is no longer the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of the O2 Telefonika in the company customer field.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed, but mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already made progress in the negotiations," says the press spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe there's a better time.
Informal information suggests that the first virtual operator should be expected by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable castle of silence.
"At the moment, we do not think there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
We have not yet been approached by any body with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," said Vlastimil Sršen in his statement to Mobil.cz from the Telefónika O2 Press Committee.
Other operators are called on the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile Spokesman Martin Kemr adds in rare agreement with the expression O2: "We have not noticed any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which we could build further."
And he adds, "In the T-Mobil network, by the end of the year, it's hard for some virtual operator to show up.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table in order to be able to reflect on this short horizon."
Vodafone resists its attention rather to meet the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open with potential virtual operators, particularly in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most profitable from the point of view of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a drop in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to get involved?
The fact that when the operators are concerned about something, they can pull a rope, they can also point to the U-phone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards ČTÚ went on at the time of the creation of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
The information on this is publicly available from the Czech Republic website.
But now the U:phone fits as an argument why the virtual operator is not allowed.
Martina Kemr said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and above all on his services."
However, given this approach, mobile operators are directly inflammatory to the complete disparagement of the Czech regulators.
It is not only the position of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries - has no power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (OOHS).
But he took his typical position on the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has yet been concluded since the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristian Chalupa of the OOHS external relations department replied in response to our question.
I don't think it'll surprise the representatives of the operators to make such a statement.
It is more than reasonable for the Authority to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
But apparently, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices is not one of the interests of OOHS.
In truth, shocking throughout the case is the touching judgment of three mobile operators resulting from their reactions.
The question is, if it's really just a coincidence, it's all on its own.
As well as the exact same price of petrol at pumping stations, it certainly is only a part of a coincidence and a hard competitive fight.
"The Authority has not found any signs of competition in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore it does not have an adequate responsibility to act on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
Interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many contentious points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the Czech Republic, according to which telecommunications are a single market in terms of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - there is always a need for the consent of the network operator to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has a pretty logical -- a monopoly on its network.
So in a particular segment, it must be a dominant one.
Even if we did not accept this argument, for OOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators are doing very much the same.
However, complaints by a number of applicants (including those mentioned by GTS Novera) show that in dealing with all operators, obstacles are very similar.
The weighting of responsibility in the Czech Republic is then a relatively common telecommunication trick, which OOHS takes away from the whole business.
We've met him in a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment of the telecommunications law, the extension of the competence of the Czech Republic to the area of competition in telecommunications has not been successful, although many experts have promised to improve the situation.
This must be known by representatives of OOHS more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's good when no one's watching.
However, the operation of some pseudovirtual operators that exist in the Czech mobile networks remains unrecognizable.
They are companies that issue their own prices of mobile phone services, which are only partially public.
It's usually multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The credits of these companies usually get to the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts against the operator as a classic company customer, which will order a large amount of SIM cards.
As a significant customer then gets special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If there are cases that you are talking about, there could be a breach of the contractual terms to which we are dealing and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martin Kemr replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is unlikely that similar activities would not bring responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are immune to this procedure.
The activities of these companies have negligible profits and, unlike actual virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points to possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers uses the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not kept in their name, so they cannot have it fully available as normal mobile operators."
But that should be the least weird thing for the OCTs.
In addition, another question for OOHS is being opened.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the formation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that OOHS has a relatively strong authority to reveal similar activities, and, if it does not want to, it does not need to be satisfied with the operator's explanation that they have no idea of anything like this and that their business conditions prohibit it.
♪ When we're not the dearest ♪
As has fallen several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in prices for services.
In fact, in virtually every country where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
Jimi's arguments used were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturized market, problems with quality of service, etc.
In the developed countries, however, in these moments, regulatory authorities were affected, not by mobile operators' interests, but by their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and the next one was packed up.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are turning the whole case over like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the notion that uncertainty in competences is more appropriate to them in these cases.
But let's not throw the flint in the rye.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator appears very soon, the Czech mobile market may re-energize.
If one of the operators has admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for OOHS to remain impervious to reject (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And we might stop calling the train than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four implementations of the new version of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek presented a new recording of the state anthems where my home was.
He recently recorded the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in congregational application and instrumental text.
The song was captured by Kateřina Kněžinková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of anthem modification are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krkek.
On iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
The White Paper considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymens.
He had previously told the Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen to sing solo variants of singers with young representative voices, which are prominent and popular.
"I've been at both of them from the beginning, and then I've also tried the congregation to take care to have a clear message to understand the text well in order to judge," he said.
The Czech National anthem will celebrate 175th anniversary next year.
Song Where my home was first heard in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovský Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovac Josef Kaietán Tyla accompanied by music by Františka Škrupa.
She gained popularity and was taken spontaneously by people.
The first piece of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of a separate Czech Republic.
What a "new" anthem sounds like.
Prague MHD in the middle of the first lift and on the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company will be recorded as the date on which the first travelers will enter the metro, tram and bus, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At this point, he can own about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Travellers can buy a 30-day and 90-day coupon (this will be paid as of 1 January 2009) and at the same time let them record their chip card in the infocentres and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Museum, Bridge, Holesovice Station, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Paradise Garden, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be bought via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz from yesterday.
More than four hundred customers used the service by the afternoon.
Those who start using the Internet can definitely forget about the exit windows at metro stations, where they have been regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
The coupon will buy on the Internet and will be recorded on the Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places, there is a box with trained service available to the passengers, which will help interested people with internet shopping and also record a coupon purchased on their card," said the speaker of the project Martin Opatný.
In addition to libraries, you will be able to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service machines, which are installed in several metro vests.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, resemble ticket markers, and the passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyla Metro Stations, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlov, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," added the Careful One.
The coupon checks the driver's slot
The machine service that starts tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are paid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
It is in suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which mainly brings the inhabitants of the medieval municipalities to the capital.
"In the trains assigned to Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers to determine the time and zone validity of coupons," explained Filip Drapal from Ropid, which sets up the timetables for Prague mass transport.
The suburban buses have card readers built in the box office by the driver.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show a chip card to the driver, but also to attach Opencard to a designated place on the side of the checkbook.
The driver will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If passengers need to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Travelers who do not drive suburban buses and will not remember when the coupon expires can go back to self-service machines where coupons are recorded.
Here is information about the validity of their documents displayed on the display of the apparatus.
Sudty wanted a referendum after the US
In 1945 the Sudanese Germans requested the inclusion of Shuuma in the United States.
It's coming from a letter that's stored in a collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
When we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under at least the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, allegedly in 1945, some groups of Sudanese Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This is due, inter alia, to a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in collections of the Jihoče Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter from the US President not to allow the return of the "Shumav County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the right situation and we want to be truly sure of the words that American troops come in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says the letter, signed with the words "People who are in the heart of Shuuma".
Because the connection to Czechoslovakia seems to give Sudetian Germans - in the knowledge of Czech national character - the hope only of brutality, recklessness, misunderstandings, oppression and slavery, asks the authors of the letter of the American President to take over Shumava a protectorate for present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would give this territory to a foreigner who oppresses and overthrows minorities and nothing, has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," says the letter.
The reason why authors can't sign is allegedly a concern about the vindictiveness of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the thinking of the Shumuvian Germans, he would have just arranged a referendum in the Shumub County on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive when it comes to postwar history today, some monuments suggest that the earlier expectations of the Sudanese Germans are well illustrated.
Even though the Czech Germans had to have at least suspected that they would be moving away from the Republic, few of them were willing to do so at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate certain types of autonomy for the Judges.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war as a Buddhist German deployed to the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holštynsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would be useful to them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia did, according to him, count that he would be removed from the Republic on the basis of the decrees of Beneš.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
Even so, it could be characterised by an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleša Rebíček's office promises to turn the driver away from the dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
A campaign for 150 million will appear on TV, radio, cinema, on the Internet, as well as on the air.
She should turn the driver away from a fast drive and alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them to fasten before they leave.
He wants to reach the conscience of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what happens in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's what the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign says:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in big letters on the espouse.
And in a pool of blood, the word is "pay."
This should symbolize that a person can pay for his own life in a moment of neglect.
The viewers will be "freaking" spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of the victims' drastic images can be seen.
He promises to reduce the accident and the number of dead on Czech roads.
The spot was prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whipping on the driver
"A sugar and whip system applies to the driver.
Sugar for them is that if they go to red, for example, it saves time.
The scourge is a threat of punishment or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of the hospital at Homolce Martin Kořan.
And that's why there's a need for information campaigns in the press and mostly negative advertising, the psychologist thinks.
They are already less effective, according to him, tables that alert drivers to danger.
"If a static table warning against danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the surrounding area and drivers will not be devoted to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the Provisional Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, i.e. Prejordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He did so in a conversation that he published on Monday, a journal by Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territory will have to be returned, if not all," said Olmert Diary.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but the Palestinians will have to proceed with a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and in particular does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in an attack on two July attacks in the city, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic sites" which lies inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It will not work," he further stressed.
Departure from Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for Israel's departure from the Golan Heights, which, according to him, is an unthinkable condition for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria only on the basis of the departure from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they'll have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hizbollah (the Shia movement); they will have to give up the sustained support they provide to Hamas terrorism (the Shia movement), the (terrorist networks) of Al-Qaeda and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Questions after an accident: Are stewardess on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a remote bus.
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus of Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arose as to whether the flight attendants and passengers could move on the bus.
"If we want to adhere strictly and formally to the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the road traffic law," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
An accident in which a 20-year-old steward died last week apparently caused a truck driver who crossed the bus.
The girl sat next to the driver, at the very least safe in the car, even though she had two more seats reserved.
The bus can, however, malfunction, or freeze sharply, even at a time when the stetard delivers coffee or newspaper.
The role plays whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the technical licence.
If not approved on the bus, passengers must be seated.
Faraway buses Student Agency do not have standing places; this has been confirmed also by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This was dealt with by the Ministry, and at first it did not allow the movement of passengers.
Afterwards, we called it off and we realized that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their seat," he said.
The Act of Steward Is Not Known
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stewardship - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legal provision neither prohibits the provision of services to the carrier.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the Guide; its rights and obligations do not define," says the less unequivocal speaker Hanzelka.
On the contrary, the Head of the Department of Traffic Vehicle Management of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, feels that the problem of the law is being adequately addressed.
"Whether the bus is allowed to stand in the type approval.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses shall be divided into urban areas, where the seats are standing and the maximum speed limit is limited, with the seats to stand at a higher speed and to a farthest point without standing at the highest speed and seats fitted with safety-belts.
Like on a plane, an expert says.
Expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the flight attendant movement on board the bus does not see a major problem.
"On foot driving, many dangers do not threaten, the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
It's not even sure when the turbulence comes, and the airship can hit its head."
"But if the bus stops sharply, of course, there are laws of physics.
Just like in a city bus or a tram.
The security of the flight attendants must deal with internal regulations," he says, and he also thinks, from the point of view of the law, the problem is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel service
Student Agency offers flight attendant services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The director does not consider their profession to be risky after an accident.
"But once I get the impression that the stewards' profession is risky, I will cancel them.
Coffee and newspaper can get passengers on their way in.
It would also save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, he justified the absence of stewards in his cars, the director of Asia Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to the SA.
"We don't have stewardess, we've been up against it from the start.
Sooner or later it will end with some fatal injury," said a year ago for Week.cz.
There's been an enormous tragedy.
In an accident of a link link link in Naples, a young stewardess from Plzeňsk, who worked for the company for two years, died.
The Slovenian truck probably broke out without using the direction from the back lane and blocked the bus route.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he failed the right front part.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards would be sold, Jančura refuses.
"It's not possible to book this place for remote connections, it's blocked."
The company's gonna sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's orchestra, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The amendment of the law?
Untouchable.
The regulation of the law on which a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport is working over a year could bring about a precise movement of stewards on board the bus.
"No particular conclusion has come to that conclusion, however.
Buses don't even solve too much, rather the combat system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile in driving," says the expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the operation of the flight attendants to be a major threat to passenger safety," said the spokesman Hanzelka, with the fact that the control of bus safety is within the authority of the police and the labour security authorities.
Düsseldorf’s Hope is Frankfurt
Big words in the WestLB board letter to the employees of this bank are not missing.
By combining the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will be created "a central financial group institution co-operable for the trading of capital markets", we will read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
WestLB shall, according to a letter in this transaction, enter a "seal of competence" ensuring long-term returns.
And it is said that such a link can be a decisive impulse for further integration in the Land Banks sector.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act during a troubled period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
The link between Deka-Bank, which customers are co-opted to know about its investment funds, and WestLB, however of any kind, has been spoken for a longer time - even on the Frankfurtian side.
Boss Deka-Bank Franz Waas, when presenting his half-year-old management results at the end of August, heard that in the merger of his home bank from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the Earth’s banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, there is no sense.
The Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is responsible for one half of the land bank and the other of the cooperatives, has entrusted the Board with conducting talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about trading in the capital market or part of it.
However, disagreements have only just begun, financiers report.
Deka-Bank, who is one of the most important employers on the Frankfurt financial market with his 3000 employees, does not speak for the first time in connection with consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that there might be a merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba bank.
There was nothing out of this three-year-old.
Shortly after the merger plans reached the public, the Hessen Land Government spoke against Helaba’s involvement.
Neither the rest of the banking houses have been so unconnected.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Even so, there have been repeated speculations about the connection between Deka-Bank and Earth banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, spoke negatively about speculation about the connection of his financial home with others.
However, it seems that, independently, there is a belief that the convergence of different public sector banking houses is a necessity.
Now, after the election to the Bavarian Landsbank Baden-Württemberg country chamber, BayernLB’s association with Landesbank could begin first.
That's not good news for Helab.
If pressure should increase to further mergers, it is gradually losing out on possible partners for such a connection.
In the south, it would play only the second violin, although the financial crisis still faces significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the merger with WestLB prohibited the Association of Sporielen and the jury banks Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 5% stake in Helaba.
That would be the case, at most, of Nord LB.
The geostrategic considerations of this species are but only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how well the business models of individual institutions are working together.
In June Merl stated that a decisive question as to what commercial model the future competitiveness of land banks should be ensured, the German Union has been cooperative and has not yet answered the jury’s banks.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why the letter from the Board also speaks of trying to find a "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual files to Deka-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend with Italy"
For Elena, it's the first time for Luca, the third time or the fourth time.
But this time Elena's gonna be his girlfriend, and he said everything's gonna be different, he says.
Behind them, at a five-litre caiser barrel, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest proves how deep tones can issue his throat.
Elena Luca's gonna crack first, and then she'll kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puerto Nuova Station, four buses with the designation "destinazione Monaco, Festa della Birra", expected arrival 6.30 will depart this evening.
Three buses are occupied mainly by the Italians, one bus is operated exclusively by Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South American people have been singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And so out loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italy.
Marc, who wears a long coat with a leather lining and glasses with wide silver rings, the three buses belong.
He's been riding Octoberfest with them for five years, and he's only been holding three trips this year.
The night there, during the day between the beer tables, at 10:30 p.m., the drive back.
Overnighting would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs EUR 75, including a welcome toast by Kaiser beer, cooked according to the Bavarian law on the purity of beer, health insurance and German speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
Buses leave by night, on the highway towards Brennero.
Beers aren't served, not yet.
The bus shuts up fast, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing well, they're still gonna need their powers.
It is located in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where 8 blocks before Munich on the highway makes another stop and a lot of other buses with an Italian brand.
When Marc's group finally arrives at the parking lot at half past Theresienwiese, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are standing there.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has the last speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First of all, put on a yellow hat.
It says "Octoberfest" on the left of the brother-in-law, next to Marc's Internet address of travel agents: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Two: "When the door opens to the beer tent, run!" calls Marco in the morning.
"Go!" Go and place your seats in the back of the tent.
"Don't go in front of you, and not all yellow hats on the same bench, move around the space!"
Máz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tips.
"Show the Securitians that we're behaved well.
When you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third: "Today, at exactly 11 p.m., be here again!" Do you understand?
And up in Wiesn, a place with beer tents.
On the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats like marks on trees, signs and even on the electoral poster of one large Bavarian side.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As the weekend with Italy is the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Accurate data on the number of visitors is not available; it is said that 50 thousand of those who are on their way across the Alps and fall into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors arrived this weekend from Italy.
A number of Munich police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts national statistics in which Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and Rakusan (approx. 80) take first place with approximately 200 medical treatments.
In Italy, the status of Hofbräu is particularly popular.
Sleepless nights for creditors Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Pierre Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and has also included the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the crisis development.
For the weekend is over.
Indices Dax monitored financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a loan of several billion from German banks to protect against turbulence on the markets.
The person notified of the situation on Monday told Reuters that this loan aid would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from a really exhausted amount.
Money is said to come from both private and public banks.
In the background, there are losses of Depfa's daughter.
According to the news report on long-term projects for which he borrowed money, this state-owned financier has been extremely short-term refinancing, which is now no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shrunk by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and slightly decreased the share of equity from 1.6 to 1.45 %.
The normal income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, revenues from the increased value of claims and certain securities, as well as from the cancellation of credit trade reserves dropped by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only because of the higher revenue from the compensation for subsequent accounting costs for the restructuring of the former group of Depf and the reimbursement of interest under the tax rules and for the facilitation of trade for the group companies, the 16 % decrease on the revenue side was still moderate.
The former state-owned financier burned himself on professional mortgages after his privatisation in 1990, which were then taken out of the service portfolio and led by Aareal Bank.
As there was too little earning in classical state funding, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of their subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write something down, and these depreciations will have a "principal material effect" on the calculation of the profits and losses of the whole group, as some have been told indefinitely.
The fact is, the dividend won't be here.
It has already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depf.
More so than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market because it does not have any deposits from customers.
After the fall of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago practically dried the strain of interbank loans because banks are keeping liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part of the Depfa credit portfolio - approx. 50 billion euros - short-term refinancing funds.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial need for this loan is covered for a long time and the company is protected "from the influence of international monetary markets at the moment to a considerable degree of inability to function".
Other sources were allowed to hear that, thanks to this money, refinancing was ensured by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to make use of the money markets at any time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of Hypo Real Estate on the market is now ensured.
It's what shareholders and creditors hope for.
But given the dynamics and inadequacy of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan would not have to be exhausted completely.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After Sunday afternoon's bank seemed to be in front of an insurrection, it couldn't, though, be a preliminary rescue, calm the passions.
The share rate has fallen by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, they held on well to the bonds.
While priority debts have virtually not moved, they lose secondary bonds more significantly.
This is mainly about the bonded former subsidiaries of Württemberg Hypo and logically obliging Württemberg Hypo with maturity beyond 2009.
Bonds Hypo-Real-Estate originally appeared as an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability must be understood, following a significant increase in the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which it introduced by taking on Depf, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count against securities within their due date.
However, it can also come to what is currently almost no longer hoped - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial retirement, there is now no doubt that legitimate hope has become the most likely borderline.
This is likely to prepare for the long-term creditors a number of nights in which they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the limit line at least to translate the loss from previous accounting periods into future return on exchange for the purpose of future capital tax payments.
Sylvana and the secret of the Bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltropova is introduced to school in Tachiban on the first day of high school, girls will start to brag: this German is a whole "cawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the mangs.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been driven from my way to school.
I live in Tokyo, towards Kawasaki, and drive 40 minutes by train in central Tachibana.
I had to find the road myself, but luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of a teaching in Tachiban is not as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine starts a short session with a teacher called 'home room'.
But before teaching, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had a school uniform yet, I took on my old dress for my hostess, for my blouse, blue underpants, and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Siónara Wo and Sylvan...' - my name is Sylvan, I come from Germany, and I have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was so glad that I started learning my language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the classroom were fucking, giggle and wave, and I still heard the word 'cawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangs.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed to survive and it means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I swung into my place quickly.
The girl next to me smiled quite wide, considered it an honour to sit next to her as a foreign student.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, I literally fell asleep.
They talked to each other and giggled and asked me about possible and impossible - and it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then everyone packed their bandages about the break.
My host mother also made me such a lunch box - and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, chicken salad and algae, fruit and some fish in a tofu cake.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
These things look strange, and they taste quite new.
Of course everything's really good.
Well, on the salty plums, no!
Bent's not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens to give the boy a handmade bento, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and he hopes to get to know the boy more intimately during the lunchtime of the break.
I read about it in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
And then I always said,
'Cause I'm just fascinated.'
After all, I've preferred to read a mango for years.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning Japanese once.
So I was absolutely clear that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, custom and custom.
And they're highly prized here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country's newest technology and trends, and on the other, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
♪ Even rats have feelings ♪
When a rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does this mean that they also experience fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals also have feelings.
But how could it be verified if they feel the same way when they act like us?
In the Internet magazine Edge, contributions from known scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else ever being able to prove, even if we can't prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have a consistent basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to devote ourselves to another species and open questions of perception or general awareness, we enter into an unfavorable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When the rat gets in danger, he will do the same as many other animals: he will pretend to be dead, gone, or attacked.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists reason for comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe in that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make transferring our subjective survival to animal survival more difficult.
However, it is because circuits associated with the human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and performing or governing functions).
This vast area is much more developed in man than in other primates, and it appears that other creatures are missing altogether.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal cortex, between them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide a person’s language: since so much of his perception is associated with the language, it is often said that knowledge depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if knowledge of the language did not matter, surely the tongue would affect it, so the animal’s consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most of the states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what the awareness of other animals may look like.
When, as an internal and subjective thing, we cannot even measure it, because of a special hardware device, analyze it based on our own experience, it builds us on its examination of major problems.
Most of my findings relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of the awareness that should be scientifically accessible.
Animal awareness processes could be examined regardless of their contents, and this is precisely what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in the case of visualisation.
But this approach, dedicated to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on neural corrals of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: they can both be identical, but they also may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of a non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does it do for feelings?
I take them out of the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain knowing its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) uses the operational memory.
It is seen from this angle that feelings are closely linked to the areas of cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In connection with linguistic nature, gentle deviations of perception are created, for with words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize states so that we assign them to each other.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and brain stem devoted to physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could easily contribute to the feelings felt by many animal families.
I can't, in purely theoretical terms, deny it, but I find it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us as fear is probably the same for both organisms: How is it possible to verify, says Pankseep, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach is running from danger - does he also feel scared?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the match of survival.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us on: rats and humans have brain stems like these, against which neither the cockroach nor the brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in a human being, how would we want to prove it in a rat?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably very different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perceptions of rats.
However, in this case, we can look forward to progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Like rats, I don't learn the language or the consciousness, I don't even know if they exist.
It's possible to think it's shortsighted, but I'd rather move forward than roll over against the wall repeatedly.
I'm an emotional practitioner.
President UEFA Platinum: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said the preparations would soon be managed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"For our country, it's not an amnesty.
The work has only just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the timely implementation of the time plan for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts converge.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will fall from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said President Grigorij Surkis of Ukraine.
"EUFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee, the Polish Federation of PZPN was called off and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlockim.
The Committee met at the request of Minister Mirosław Drzewiecký.
He said there is "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki Polish Press Agency PAP.
"We assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this step would not make preparations for ME 2012."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to a forced descent in the past season because of manipulations, and eventually even the start of the league had to be moved quickly.
The violent Dennis Quaid strikes back.
She wanted to make an advertisement for a new film, she talked about private affairs in a conversation - and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke of her ex Dennis Quaid as a divorceer.
He's furious and he's kicking back.
The late war of roses in the former marriage mate Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are having an unsettling argument - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan spoke for the first time in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week on the grounds of her marriage collapse: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she was informed of the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
To promote this mental strip is the PR of Ryan's work for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was marked: "It's crazy," said a 40-year-old New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly exaggerates the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
Moreover, it is "politicious" that to a combined 16-year-old son of Jack again "publicly resembles the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a twin father.
He concludes: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself happy to have an amazing family that is doing well."
Prices of flights and hotels decrease
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights according to one current study were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and accommodations in hotels have been reduced again - this is the result of a study by American Express travel and financial service providers.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made since the first half of 2008 and, following the rise of prices in the first quarter, found their marked decline in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already slowed down.
From January to March prices rose in 41 out of 48 monitored European cities by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The American Express sees a weak dollar course as the cause of this trend, which caused the "declining taste of American tourists to travel".
Financial centres, such as Hannover, Kolín nad Rhine or Stavanger, have also been hit more heavily by the drop in hotel prices.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices have even recorded a European record by 26.3 percent.
In the first quarter, air prices also showed an upward trend:
Because of the destruction of kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, for fuel demanding long-range flights, up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of flights in the Economy class decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but changes in Business and First Class classes were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices went down even more significantly than in other European countries:
Between January and March, 11.9 percent increased, and 23.6 percent dropped in the second quarter.
In the German national years, even half of the price dropped according to the study quoted.
One reason for this price drop is the slowing economic growth, explained the company.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there exists an Open Skies agreement that liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe, increasing competitive pressure.
The sign of the tense situation is the disruption of non-profit lines by air carriers, as well as a high number of air companies that put forward a competition in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goalie and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the head of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to build a functioning eleven.
It was written by Kristoffer Klein - to enlarge the unfinished landing for the representative of Marko Marina.
This player from Gladys got involved in the game until late and failed with the blown balloon on the stick.
His report was accurately formulated and sounded convincingly out of his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," cried Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the break between half-times ended, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than a few moments.
And so his request was also heard in a place of responsibility.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant attracted and raised his finger on the sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Chief Coach Hamburg Martin Jol.
His orders were probably similar: here with the other goal!
It didn't happen.
"It wasn't looking at everything nice here today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even the Bastian Reinhardt would be "wanted to be more relaxed".
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgian thanks to Mladen Petrica's head (11) and the circumstances that very weak Gladysans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV celebrates 121 years of its existence this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and a lively updated table on the video wall, where their team was presented as a premiere.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcel Jansen.
It feels that the continuous table result symbolizes the incalcibility of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Neves and Silva Brazilians, goalkeeper Petrice and FC Bayern won by Jansen - is slowly located but still unable to shine.
"We need more feeling and more drifting," Jol said.
After voting
There's fear spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to fall by 700 points.
That was the biggest future loss in his history one day.
After that, Dow picked up something.
Around 20:30, this most important world stock exchange barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The technological storm of Nasdaq was more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this point American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America lost about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs' stock has lost nearly ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the company had a stake in the grandinvestor Warren Buffett.
In the context of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the whole amount should not be paid out at once, but in several stages.
The remuneration is to be paid by the State to receive the share lists of financial companies that could be paid in the event of a favourable development of the course, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Action courses in Europe fall
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US does not dissipate investors.
The stocking course of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly down and downloads the Dax index.
The American Dow Jones index is losing despite the state's planned financial market rescue.
Spectacular exchange losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have dropped the index of German shares (Dax) deep into the minus.
The shares of the Munich real estate finance company lost up to three quarters of its value through the bailout of the Federal Government and private banks, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax fell clearly under a psychologically important limit of 6,000 points and minus 3.7 percent recorded 5,839 points.
There were stock markets all over the world on their knees.
New York started a business day on Wall Street with significant losses.
Investors fear that a $700 billion rescue package of the U.S. government would not have had to be sufficient to revive financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent during the first hour of trading, so it's 10,809,25 points.
The American House of Representatives is scheduled to vote in favour of the rescue plan, the Senate may speak on 1 October.
The other European storms were moving only one way: the FTSE index in London first weakened by 3.2 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japanese head Nikki index dropped by 1.26 percent to 11 743.61 units after initial earnings.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18 286,90 points.

In MDAx, they lost after the announcement of an increase in the fixed assets of the Arcandor stock.
The private bank of Sal. Oppenheim wrote down 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourism company announced that it would not sell shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years scientists have not known the advice of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein would not have to be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses space probe flew through space.
She is now threatened with death by winter because of the fuel lines that will soon freeze.
Among scientists, for years one mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - an anomaly of gravity practice.
Gravitation work is an air manoeuvre of space probes, where they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of some cosmic body, such as Earth.
This can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What a scientist has been saying for years in this case in amazement: flying bodies do not behave exactly as man would have expected under the old good gravity law.
On the contrary, there is an irregularity at speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He's been baptized by an anomaly of gravity.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, should not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton remains convinced that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the anomaly of gravity through so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe has been discovered by astronomers.
"The responsible for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It's obviously a gravitational force that can be observed as a result of other cosmic bodies.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means she doesn't transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just not even a visible light.
According to the scientific calculations, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe is from this dark matter.
In Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is at large
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to a report by the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is once again at large.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
I heard six kidnappers were killed in a firefight before they were released.
Five Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
I heard the ransom talk's on the move.
The Germans have repeatedly become the targets of the kidnappers.
Welt ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
Europe's tourists are said to be free of charge by tugs in the Sahara.
Egyptian state television, Arab television stations Al-Arabija and Italian media reported on this.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24 release, confirmed: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were liberated.
We are just verifying their health status," Frattini said.
According to a report by the Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are in order and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
Inexplicable remains the background of the shooting before the hostages were released: according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed with the ransom," said the quoted worker.
They said, "it was only a hostage to take over," when suddenly there was this "surprise."
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad, and Egypt shot six kidnappers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom, referring to one of the German mediators, said that the release of hostages stretches because kidnappers fear for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
Men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by the father "has led to suicide"
Several years of abuse by the father led a woman to kill herself, sounded before a court of law.
After confessing eight cases of sexual harassment, 7 - year - old Michael Treese of Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that Stephanie Randle’s stepdaughter was regularly bound when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treris wrote in confession.
It was also said that Ms. Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child living in Coventry, Treese tied her eyes together and then abused her sexually while her mother worked in the pub.
Treris and his wife were divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the court, Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, had followed the pattern of abuse she had twice a week.
The prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006 they called Miss Randle's friends, who also devoted very much to surfing and cycling, that she was "emically dead" and that "she gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She appears to have choked with an igelite bag.
Randle stood face to face the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a confession that ended with saying, "I tied her up and tied her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and for your sacrifice, it must have been awful when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her life.
Even worse is the fact that if she hadn't done that, the thing would probably never have gotten to court."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences, according to Stephanie's parents, your crime against their daughter over the years," he added.
"It seems otherwise would be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
An official who loses data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man concerned left two top secret documents on the Waterloo train when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were placed in the hands of BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It's the least serious offense against this law, and nothing indicates a criminal intent.
The BBC correspondent for defense Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Government Office," he said.
An employee who must not be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police Officer complain on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyses of Al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Company reserves face B&B debt
British cooperative reserves may have to deal with over 80 million pounds of debt after saving Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion pounds to protect their deposits.
The interest on this loan will be paid to all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperatives.
Director-General of the Association of Cooperatives (BSA) Adrian Coles said he was "disgusting", that the reserve and their members must pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be paid by saving the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
In the meantime, however, the interest paid every year will be paid by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Compensation Plan Fund for the BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperatives are based in this issue.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not so far been so considerate
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it had held and that the reserves should pay about 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on debt will increase to £450 million in 2009.
That means the reserve will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the cooperative business association, said BBC that he believed that it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the swing of the housing market must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions which were far from so considerate."
According to the BSA, no backup since 1945, when it appeared, has fallen.
"We'll have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what are the options to protect the cooperative reserves and their members from an account that might be significant," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 shall cover seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year and it could be almost twice as much.
In view of the fact that cooperatives are shareholders-free organisations, this account will ultimately be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
The milk will leave by five penny per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy said it would raise the wholesale price of its milk by five pennies per litre on Monday.
It's already the second growth this year, after a two-pence disturbance in February, and it's coming after a research carried out by the consultancy company.
Retailers are to decide for themselves if they want to reflect the theft in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey’s milk was last changed in 2002.
Deposits for Bangladesh's ex-mémoire have been rejected
The Bangladeshi court rejected the application of former Prime Minister Šajch Hasína Vadžid for bail, which means that if he returns to his country, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the charge that the blackmail had gained over $50 million ($729,700) from a certain entrepreneur when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several charges of corruption that are brought against it.
Zijáová, a long-standing political rival of Sheikh Hasin, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasína is scheduled to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), asked that the local army-held government give her full freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she has been released for an honorable term in order to undergo a foreign medical procedure, it is not clear under the terms of her release that she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Its lawyers say that now they appeal against the Supreme Court's ruling to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected the Sajch Haszyna's request for bail by not needing bail when abroad has already been subject to an examination released for an honest statement," said defence attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal to the Supreme Court regulation."
Her lawyers said she needed bail so she could return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
The High Leader of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasin is due home after October 17.
She was detained last year after an army held by the provisional government took over power, but she was released from prison in June to be abroad for medical treatment.
Shaikh Hasin and Chálida Zijáová both reject all the charges against each other.
Fear of Armor vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children did not take part in a recent general anti-ruption vaccination due to violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the UN did vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says that for security reasons she could not reach the children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The United Nations speaker said that this was the case despite Taliban promises that there would not be thousands of injecting workers to attack or defend them at work.
BSKYB has lost the ITV lawsuit
BSKYB has lost a court hearing to review the Commission’s competition decision, which has ordered the company to reduce its share in ITV’s competitive broadcast.
BSKYB’s appeal tribunal ordered that its share in ITV be reduced from 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSKB’s share had a competitive fight and had an disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSKYB bought a share in 2006 in a business that prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of BSkyB's ITV share had given rise to doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Commission to initiate the investigation.
The director of the consortium Virgin Sir Richard Branson, the consumer organisation and regulator Ofcom were all against buying.
BSKYB argued that the forced reduction of her share in ITV was unreasonable and as a disproportionate solution - above all because BSKYB had previously said that she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New investigations into the affair of American lawyers
The US chief prosecutor appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
Tah came in a situation where the report on the affair drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized officials of the White House, the legislator and former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was fueled by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy, will now be investigating whether during the investigation officials lied to investigators in order to dream of justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: "A serious complaint, including potential criminal conduct, has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to make witnesses respond was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Ministry of Justice stripped nine American lawyers of their functions in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry stated that the lawyers had been released because of poor performance.
Later, however, it turned out that the release of lawyers was no worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was motivated politically.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, others refused to investigate allegations of fraud against the Democrats.
American lawyers investigate and prosecute in court cases under the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for his release and eventually resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The report of the Inspector General was very critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying that he bore "main responsibility" for his release that he "produced" from his leading position and in the event of "suddenly failed to engage".
Other officials, including former Bush advisor Karl Rovea, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat of Loaf will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who comes to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" with recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was titled Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
This year's nomination is led by the Coldplay group, which got into a more successful selection in four categories.
Paul Reese, editor-in-chief of the Q Magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand on such things as time and genre, and the Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
A song written by Jim Steinman needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrument part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and peaked at 15.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell held on the ladder for about nine years and sold it over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Day - suffered from health problems in recent years, in 2003 he was also operated on because of irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
High street, often forgotten, and maybe soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other ground-based communications, some famous, others only useful.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and long-term locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little street is in the East Village neighborhood leading north from First Street - without access to Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a half feet [40 m], it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic move.
There's no sign of street names.
It's practically invisible in a regular atlas.
Yet, there is an admirer’s street.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to clean up the Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are to be opened in the new buildings.
The other admirers are the long-standing neighbors who say they've been enchanted by a narrow alley simply because it was one of the last remaining ones since the block was flattered.
However, the City Building Protection and Development Authority, which has a street in its power, is not least interested in keeping it.
At the meeting of the Land Committee of the municipal community, representatives of the City Authority and Avalon Bay planned a plan to buy the developer of the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of the Community General, the Committee favours such a variant when the street remains in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns only very few land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for correction and administration, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to clean up the little street and settle the seats, several of which would use a coffee shop, whose interest in renting the space of the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to fix this deserted street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the office for the preservation of the estate, said that the city really wanted to sell to the street, and pointed out that the task of his office was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to her more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a mark in the history of the shallow.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's large farm was divided between several of his children and that narrow strip of land no one claimed.
The Extra Place led the back door of CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is perhaps the most famous as the background of the photograph on the album cover of Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took a picture in November 1976.
"It was full of waste, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about East Village settlement, object to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, though modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rarity - almost unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on behalf of Jeremiah’s disappearing New York (with the title “Book of Shriekings: a bitter nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction”), posted part of the story about Extra Place from the box Let’s talk about the city that appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, blind street, dark even in the day and confined to the cutting iron gates of the warehouses and locked windows, where the old newspaper has been running through the roofs for a week."
Except for a few exceptions, the alley of a recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat passed through the dead end of the street near the doors that used to lead to CBGB, where the expensive clothing store stands today.
There was graffiti on the wall, and next to the fresh amount of discarded newspapers, there was an empty beer bottle.
A couple of passersby said that Extra Place rarely meant anything, but suggested that he could use a lift.
On the contrary, Fields said he thought some people underestimated the impact of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "weak, wet and disgusting places."
Debate on balance sheet quality: immersion in English
In this issue of the section The focus on education will be Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discusses the position of candidates for pooling education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic staff from the califnesstics and the Director of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Better Than You Think: Why High Schools Need to Choose Schools".
Effectively addressing the Hispanic voters is an insidious matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda just proves it.
Obama's campaign points out that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to complete than white pupils," which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda specifically promotes "transitional bilingual education" for those who are only learning English.
However, the question of Barack Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes that languages other than English should be used in class, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Let's take the Sixth Street Prep, charter primary school in Los Angeles East.
The students of this school are in most cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have just arrived recently, are only learning English.
Even so, in the state math tests in 2008, 100 percent of fourth grade students reached the highest level.
Almost as amazing as 90 percent of the fourth - grade students reached the highest level in the state tests of English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a method that Obama prefers.
Sixth Street highlights control and exercise, continuous assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Next, and this Obama should note, is according to Linda Michaels, Director Sixth Street, the school's pedagogical approach to those who are only learning English, "full immersion".
Dating into English emphasises the almost superior use of English in teaching.
Ms. Michaels, who is against billiard education, said to me, "We had a great success with one completely new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would have entered the class and didn't know who he was."
"It works," she said, "for us it works."
Would Obama take the school as Sixth Street Prep as a role model, what should other schools look like with large proportions of Spanish and English students?
The results achieved by the school should be self-evident from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of his own side (the National Educational Association is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education is a prerequisite for Obama's answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase the performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply due to renewed economic fears
On Monday, oil prices plummeted due to the concern that even an American financial market rescue plan would not have to revive the economy.
The prices of fixed-term oil trade fell in early trading at the New York Commodity Exchange by up to 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 per barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street, as well as by two strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145,29 per barrel in July, prices earlier this month dropped to nearly $90 per barrel, which then jumped on the wave of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety reopened investors on Monday, even after the Congress Presidency announced that the weekend had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report was covered by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy Wachova Corporation’s banking section.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially matured the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the raging weekend meeting, which led to the economic recovery plan, "showed itself unable to revive the mood on the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"Reviews for markets with global shares, interest rates and exchange rates have been severely impaired," analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
"We think the Commodities won't be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is how far the American virus will spread to the world and especially to China."
The analysts of this bank cut their expectations for the next year, as oil consumption declined due to the slower growth of the economy, and reduced their forecasts of gasoline prices for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter overcame team record
After spending more than anyone in the last eight seasons in Jets, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter in which Jets turned the pointless game into a great ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and Arizona's Cardinals settled their tormented game with the dark clouds over them.
Then Quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveragues Coles to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly premeditated the afternoon in which their gradually evolving cooperation moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter after another two touchdowns, including the one where he fell hornerback, and the next 10 seconds before the half game.
"It was nothing extraordinary," said Favre about all his winnings to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
We had excellent communication, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Cole were throwing, the defense attacked the quarterbacks of Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it by 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith was doing another pass and picking her up.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the football Bowens forced was probably the best.
The team of Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a twenty-yard field goal, which won the lead 34-0.
That's the most they ever got to Jets in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was invited to describe this madness, said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter unanswered - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third quarter.
There's been a lot of points in the short time zone."
The rest of Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long race ever, when on Sunday in the Berlin marathon, he surpassed his own world record and became the first person to run 26.2 miles of race under two hours and four minutes.
Winning on a pleasant flat line in time 2:03:59 won by 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - surpassed the world record or is at least the world's champion at all distances from a metric mile to a marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie left off the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because he was afraid - from a backward standpoint perhaps too scared - that polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on the start, 55 degrees in the finish - won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a flashy diameter of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As the trail runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on a longer track, the Marathon record of the past decade dropped by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told the press that he had a spatula two weeks ago and missed a week of practice.
The break obviously woke him up more than delayed.
"I am so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little doubty today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for overly planning his races, generally avoiding the world's Marathon peaks, relying on guides as if it were a race on the track, and building world records over the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassi's tremendous running quality.
Held at the pace of the four Kenyans reached Gebreselassia half at 1:02:04.
After the guides had fallen off, two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, constantly chased Gebreselassie.
A little earlier than three miles before Gebreselassia's goal he took and fled Kwambai, who then took second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitěnková, a native from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record Time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Twenty-six-year-old Mikitýnková won the spring in London's marathon last year at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games missed something described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon, which had ever run, improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race wisely and thoughtfully: she let a square of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run into a big lead and then reached them for about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia ran second by 2:21:31 and Helen Kiprop from Kenya ended third in 2:25:01.
Pride and obstacles to the lives of black people in a separate city
Hidden among the scattered amusement parks of the Greater Orlando, several miles from all glossy, noisy and obnoxious, lies the quiet city in which the pride and the demandingness of African-American life survives.
Eatonville, the first complete black town that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "city of five lakes, three croquet courses, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough quay, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival Zora! to compliment the Hurstons, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains aside, although she made a stop for tourists by including it in the florid tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what's missing."
Even today, when the Black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many of the people here remain cautious about the views of strangers.
"We pay great attention to how our story is being told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as the paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both the historical model of the Black Rise and the community of almost 2,400 people, where poverty is twice as high as the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also a shadowed example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - which originated from American slavery.
It is not too surprising that the people here are both proud and protective.
And the concerns about the image of Eatonville really began with Zorah, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through a hearty book full of murmurs like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the florid tourist guide changed the city to road No. 17, which leads through the often blurred center of Florida, into the stage of Black history and human drama.
With the destruction of a large drum in life and in literature, Hurston brought his readers to the store of the first eatonville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"Left by the road," she wrote, "is a white brown decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write."
She also mentioned the new widow's husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all sorts and anything that fits into the hourly hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville was connected with self-government, but also with illiteracy, rejuvenating marriages and sex.
This obviously wasn't the typical editor's office of Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Morning said it as it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipmunk that often came back after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Augustus Franklin, a seven - year - old, remembers that most of the time, when she reached the city, she arrived unannounced in the magnificent Chevrolet, smoked and wore her trousers in the city, which is still proud of her dignified dress.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were scorching.
"People of Zoru have always liked to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabalia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in the Florida Fort Pierce, where she had lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no more mourning ceremonies or much public reading.
"I don't think they understood her meaning for the world or her legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston CV "Wraped in Rainbows (packed in rainbows)" released in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
Representatives of the district of Orange County wanted to stretch the city through a five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a two-way main road.
The climbing of Orlando has already pushed interstate highway No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a difficult historical period.
The forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, he brought the struggle for stirring the race of hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys came and threw oranges and things at people who were sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"In fact, we had a lady who killed her.
They were walking out of a melon car."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel of 1955, Hurston questioned the requirement of the highest court for forced integration and declared that his decision in the Brown case against the education chamber was "for my race insulting rather than celebrating."
The inhabitants now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth here.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiriová, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It took until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, added.
"You don't hug your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped to create space for many other Zory Neale Hurstons - Black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudices with light-minded self-confidence and quotes such as "How anyone can deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker entered the unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight for the revival of her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the booksellers' bookshelves praised Hurston's biography by Robert E. Hemenway, who re-entered the American canon.
The project with the highway arrived just the moment the most famous daughter of Eatonville found a light ramp again.
Herston's former neighbors now viewed her as a savior.
To show what could happen to her highway, the community started planning the Hurston festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived two years later at the inauguration event, and many come back each January to celebrate.
After a few years, he resigned from the highway proposal.
"These five streams of highways have risen, you'd say it directly blew up, real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image of the city.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started going to the church here in 1993, began to appear in a larger number, and the people began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (called after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 to the newly paved and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a florid anomalies: only six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a narrow alley in summer rain, as small as it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
Foreign people who come looking for the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated cautiously.
Permission for most interviews is necessary to have in advance and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church that painted whites and that depict blacks in the fields - are not allowed to take photographs.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher who likes to eat red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival has increased, domestic pride has also increased.
Especially young people are drawn to seeing Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, working, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnic groups.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, sounds sincere love for the community when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or the police that he says would enjoy some help.
And even younger ones, such as 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexi Kenonov, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, will think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment in history, it's a very nice town."
Here in New York we all speak fluently Finnish
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newsstands and huge TV screens on Times Square, they would not realize that they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in a glass beehive the offices above their heads have bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still rapping metal carts across the halls, and they're transferring muffin bakers to breakfast.
The Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, 50 long-sleeved shirts hanging from the shafts on their backs.
The office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street dining stations, and it is still impossible to get a yellow cab between 4:00 p.m. and 7 p.m. on the day of the day.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until, with all the pessimism talk, he decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had time for this task to cover myself with a late afternoon session at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting in the queue.
Not in front of the cash boxes to pick up or save cash, but before the bulkhead, where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to the Macy's mixed goods store and new customers set up bills.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason I did.
But they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called terrifts (a little like construction savings), money associations, and types of savings companies whose branches operate only in one state, and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks were silently bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion asset bank, went to the audition, and when the New Yorkers returned home on the weekend of Friday night, another bank, Wach, with $440 billion in assets, tried to hunt down a rescue buyer.
Employees of offices and shops who stood in front of me and feared another collapse moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe port and which makes most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent Finnish in the last week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and to her skinny top executive employee Dick Fuld with such familiality as if she was gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lynn, a uniformed 50-year-old mother-in-law of my redneck, changed the subject of our regular conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food supply.
After my visit to the bank, she said, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim graves defiled after the Austrian right-wing fracture
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-hand side of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-hand side Vlaams Belang participates in a demonstration presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the organization "Ves against Islamisation".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that display mosques crossed by a red line.
Police are accusing right-wing extremists of blaming the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties have achieved huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun, near Linz, were once between Friday evening and this morning severely destroyed, and the police are convinced that it was an organized action.
The culprits have supplied certain tombs with Jewish symbols such as David’s star, but the detectives believe it could have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident has been connected in any way to the elections.
The speaker from the Islamic community here said that they are "deeply shocked" by reports of the desecration that comes as the Muslim post-month Ramadan is nearing the end.
In the meantime, Austria enters the circle of searching for its own soul after the traffic in yesterday's parliamentary elections escalated.
Both extreme right-wing parties, who have gained more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, have led a comprehensive anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans have been condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Freedom Party, who received over 18 per cent of the votes, protested against shakies and burks in the campaign, even expressed his opposition to the food in which the relationship to Islam is perceived.
At his last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke of the "European brotherhood", which is intended to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties seek to prohibit the construction of mosques and minerals and argue that these are political symbols of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Research and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which put extreme rights in the position of the country's strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter must not take a trip abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star convicted of sexual abuse of children, ordered the court to travel to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that they were planning to travel through France to Spain.
This travel ban was agreed to by the Kent police last Thursday after it gave officials evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, in his own name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The speaker said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kent police requested a regulation to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gad was not personally involved."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as the record of sexual attackers tells him.
He has to notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also hand over the scheduled date of departure to the police a week ahead.
If the obligation to inform the authorities were to be waived, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible route to the district.
The Kenyan police said, "The Kent police will do everything they can to protect the children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to follow someone who stays in Britain, because we have vast systems that manage potential dangers more efficiently.
To protect Kent's people is the highest priority for the Kent police, and we are working hard to monitor the behaviour of sexually active attackers so as to reduce any danger to the public to a minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to fly to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass the passport and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22nd, he finally arrived at the 3 Heathrow Terminal and remained there, while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridgen Lowest Criminal Court in West London and at the same time successfully sought an order that ordered him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacques Smith, Minister of the Interior, was calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To catch the real character, taking the master off the stage." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenca, detached from focusing on interpretation - I'm just reaching out to the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
The second is human.
Indistinguishable, if we miss privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then we can see a confidential gesture, a deep breath of captured sight, or passionate gesturing of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to stand on the stage.
German Günther Bauer alters "Flamenco-people" theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less-known face of masters.
With this intent, the photographer builds a unique iconography of flamenca from various environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the framework of the program "Mes de la Photographia Flamenca", "reflects the ever-growing international significance of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that they are not typical pictures of artists on the stage.
These people portraited "on the street" are artists able to carry on the stage passion, sadness, joy... and totally catch the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists there is no need to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that will allow me to capture the personality of the giant flamenca.
Fascinated by the festival "Cante de las Minas" in 1997, Bauer began a long journey of portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers to the board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different stylistic tools is contrary to the classic background of the image and lends it to the present spirit, an idea that is reflected by Bauer himself by the flamenco: "The music with very traditional roots, which, however, does not cease to be surprising and evolving."
What is tearing away the viewers is not an act of dancing, singing or playing itself, but of the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we will meet with the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, that was and is the constant work presented during these days at the El Fotomata Gallery.
This selection of nearly 70 photographers is composed of famous flamenca figures, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project became a kind of flamenca antology and soon there will be a book edition that will contain exhibited portraits.
The portrait passion led Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating the idea of "Portraits of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept from "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "to take pictures of people, to recognize them and have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or only short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think there's the most difficult genre in the photograph.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities that he sometimes doesn't know or can only give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenca called "Flamenco-people" is displayed in the El Fotomata Gallery in the street of the de la Mata 20, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llos admitted that the novel he's writing is a "futality"
It's happening in an environment that he doesn't know yet, and he's talking about events that he doesn't know yet, yet Mario Vargas Llosa is going to successfully accomplish his new project - he's working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and traveled also in Amazonia.
The eternal favorite of Nobel Prizes for Literature was admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segavia festival that the project that is currently hiring him is "a trouphality", and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it, and I believe I will finish it once," concluded his contribution to the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which he saw in the city within four days of the aqueduct of hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of others.
The author of novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main figures of the third anniversary of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llos, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutal Friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, he had a dedicated audience who had spent an hour of time as water - a Peruvian with amazing accuracy and an internal dose of humor remembered how he had in him since his original "unbelievable adventure" from "the pleasure of an passionate reader" and from "the power to live more than I have lived" gave birth to a literary mission; how he has followed "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplined", carefully fine text, correcting and rewrites; or how they influenced his writings by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas and what "re paintings" are the bedrock of his stories.
Hispanoamerican novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, an excruciating experience" - stressed Vargas Llos with the fact that according to him he "acts on people" and "will make them try to get out of line" and called the writers to "do not succumb to frivolity" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Climate science is losing the celebration in Oboblanc - no copy
The performance with the copies, which closes the ceremony in Pzooblanc, was cancelled yesterday morning after confirmation of the fact that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
Therefore, together with Fermin Bohórquez, Pable Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, the company decided to cancel the bullfights.
The unfavorable weather conditions of this celebration are long-standing, two of the three celebrations could not have been held.
On Saturday, the rains made it impossible for other planned bullfights to pass.
During the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bulls in the arena in Castil Blanco.
That's how it was celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and paid a reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high performance was taken on his shoulders.
On the same day of the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two shots by digging for greetings and one ear, which brought him uncovered seats in the arena rather than toreador's art.
Even worse was El Juli, who passed through the bull's arena of Los Llanos, unsatterly unbiased.
In the second round of the work, without a single breath, he used a sharp criticism from most audiences.
They've taken control in Álava in the van with 2,000 pounds of hashish.
In ten minutes, five.
Ertzaintza road control in the city district of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop two people driving in a van and they drive them.
The cost, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Committee on the Interior of the Basque Government, the members of the Committee were persecuted and detained by one of the persons driving in the van, a man 38 years of age, who was identified as A.A. J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and forgery of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks at N-1 in places where they passed through the city district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop the delivery for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, speeded up and caught.
The car’s drivers began to pursue immediately when the vehicle stopped at the roadside a few kilometres away, at which point both passengers jumped out and fled into the forest.
Ertzaintza’s followers eventually caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects transported, as evidenced by the search of the Iveco Daily brand.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with Hashish packages, which were subsequently transported to other police departments for detailed experimentation and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "damaged" and did not agree with the data provided in the documents of the delivery, so the detainee was also charged with counterfeiting state documents.
Ertza continues its search for the second suspect, who, as mentioned above, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the drug seized.
Arrested A.A. J., 28 years old, he was transferred to the police department for the execution of appropriate formalities before he later joined the next investigation.
Heather Locklear actress detained while driving under the influence of drugs
Heather Locklear's actress, Amanda's favorite from the Melrose Place series, was detained in Santa Barbara this weekend after driving under the influence of medication.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, reported the magazine People, a spokeswoman for California road patrols.
She explained that around 4.30 p.m. Locklear "wipped to the gas, ran forward and back for a loud tug and tried to get out of the parking space - she ran over the sunglasses several times during the sledgehammer.
The witness who apparently didn't recognize the actress first saw Locklear moments after stopping at a nearby highway and leaving the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found an actress inside the vehicle, which, in part, blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented" and therefore the members took her to a specialised drug and alcohol centre to test herself.
According to the police speaker, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were ruled out at once, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was obvious to the guards at first sight."
Locklear was detained for suspected control under the influence of the effects of the unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 19:00 even though she was released for freedom a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamasares urges the Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in the Silva bailout
The general head of IU and the envoy for the United Left Gaspar Llamazares today announced that the final decision in the causation of the former Youth Council and Sports Council at Seville Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from the office last week after being accused of acting in favour of his family, would depend on the regional association of the party.
"I am an too much federalist for this, it is for the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," said Llamares, a meeting to which the party will have to proceed in relation to a former member of the Sevilla City Council.
However, the chief of IU insisted that in the case of an investigation of illegal conduct committed by Silva, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party had a "strict ethical code for all public functions".
"Cat blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "Sangre de mayo" inspired by the Epizodes from the national past of Benita Pérez Galdós, revives the famous rebellion of the Spaniards against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the film maker wanted to "make an illustration of the figures and analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today, together with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarria, during the presentation of the film before the extensive team of interpreters.
The flower blood with a subway in over two and a half hours will be placed in the movies this Friday and more than a four-hour TV series Telemadrid is being prepared in the future.
As a great admirer of literary works by Galdós José Luis Garci, he said that by making this film he had fulfilled the "childly dream", for which he thanked Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years ago in the Autonomous Province of Madrid, entrusted him with filming the two hundredth anniversary of the Madrid 2 May, he accepted the offer with the fact that the event would come from the Epizod national past.
The budget of the 15 million to which the Madrid province has made a complete contribution means for Garcia "a unique opportunity" to create an environment with scenes and costumes corresponding to the image "of the crushing Spain which was mistaken in the leader for whom it was fought - fighting for independence led Ferdinand VII to the collapse and backwardness of the country," he said.
But the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support he received from the movies of the Sad Wing (Al Triste) or Goy's ghosts - almost twice as many of the May blood - he could not have produced some of the scenes from the script signed simultaneously by Horace Valcárcel, with which he works almost all over his film track.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empezar) works as usual - on the scene with actors with whom he usually tries and does not select casting because it feels "lower" and believes that "part of the director's profession is to go to theatres and cinemas and thus learn what happens in the crafts he deals with".
Many of the actors he chose for May blood appear in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia with four nominations to Oscar, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the April blood itself, the seven tables of the French billionaire and the last selected blind sunflower, does represent a young generation of Spanish film scene, but claims that "it will only appear".
No award is expected for this film by Garcia.
"At first, you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize that you're only working for profit, so you're willing to do another movie," explains Garcia with over 30 years of directorial career.
Isabel Bayon is reviving the spiritual legacy of the Seville Dancer Tórtola Valenciaová
Seville's flamenca dancer surrenders the hold of another seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of the father of Catalance (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and of the mother of Andalusanky (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Trian district, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced a modern dance and focused on the oriental dance.
She lived a life full of passion, was a pioneer of female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the removal of a corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of the interwar Europe, Isabella Bayon, has been acclaimed.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not talking about telling her life, we're talking about seizing her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenc.
So "the butterfly dance" evicted me of a guajira or "the snake dance" some thong.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic was also appropriate," she says.
The presentation is based on two special personalities: Miguel Lead, who will sing in one performance as well as in "Open Doors" (La Puerto abierta), and with teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and joined with her former cat.
"Matilde represents the older Tórtola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she has accepted an offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor to me."
The performance also includes music and guitars by Jesús Torres and Paca Arriagy, singing by Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; El Pajara drums, Viola Rafa El Viola and co-operation by Juanfry Juárez, "who has the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primates with everything, and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account this woman's life, which took place in such far-reaching places as India, the United States or Russia, and throughout Europe, because she was usually living in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point, but nobody knows her today and even less appreciates her work," Bayon says.
The show begins today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Day of Fresh Married" closes the triennials
The introduction of the first illustrative edition of the "St. Stephen's Church" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andal Government at the celebration of the "Trienals of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
"Trianal Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is headed towards the end of the new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramon Jiménez: Onen ray of the sun", which was opened in May of this year, and after bypassing the various Andalusian provinces, according to plans at the time of the congress, should be moved to New York.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andal Government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Denika freshly married" edited by Pedre Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis in order to continue to spread awareness of the personality and works of one of the world's most sacred andalusian poets.
America doesn't like each other that much without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect humans.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of Sally Field's actress, who worked with him on "No Evil Purpose" and under the burden of knowing that Newman has left, reveals his uncomforted vision of abandoned American cinema and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be severely ill.
Still, he was a guy for all of us.
"Sometimes what one feels cannot express in any way, and I've lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
Father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American confidence is at the bottom of desperate search for reasons of pride.
When the time is rough and people without virtue and only a handful of those who are worthy of your admiration - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodies almost the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and the fighter for lost and won cases, from the drug addiction foundation based on honor of the firstborn son who died of overdose, to his own brand of home food and biofood.
A full treasure for the country, which was worth much effort to rid itself of a suicide eating culture.
The stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man died, but one whole era.
Another Englishman, the holder of the Oscar for Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without an excess the height of his career.
Bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, named himself Newman's greatest source of inspiration.
"This fox has put us all on a pretty high leash," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live like a live Paul Newman - based on honesty and leads a serious private life far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are and Paul Newman is their role model.
He got divorced once, and since then he's been married 50 years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, even though he had more than enough chance not to be.
"Why would I go out for a burger when I have a filet at home?" He likes to joke.
May he be proud in heaven to have his daughters and admirers rule the earth - it is not common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles that he embodies, he was the proudest in the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a sacrificed philanthropist".
Olympic Madrid’s Incomplete Races
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the failed 2012 it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we're going to run the race yesterday, I say no!
They spoke of him as a perfect race, and in my judgment, he was the worst one I've ever been to.
Such a bunch of nonsense, that if there was an evaluation and I was testing, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the start, one at a time.
The nonsense starts by picking up a racing number that makes a man have to go out early.
That doesn't sound bad to me, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip that's supposed to avoid overfilling the path).
Oh, no.
Here one had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there just because of it) and (after standing the corresponding line) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt size S (second nonsense because I need the size XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only little T-shirts because it's less fabric and they're cheaper?
Well, that's a little bit compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon for the chip and the front for it lasted over 15 minutes, he had to give up the backpack.
The waiting period lasted over 35 minutes, which is at the race, where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't put our bags down yet, and once it's done, picking up was a lot worse.
In addition, the waiting extended 40 minutes of rain, which led to general insurrection and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will be immersed in the air tomorrow, and some of us, like me, will not be able to get the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me and which I assume did not notice the time of the launch.
Of course, if someone asked me about some perfect race, this one wouldn't have attacked me.
And so I think we're just gonna have to keep the Olympic city well prepared.
Microsoft is looking for reception (virtual)
At a conference on new technologies, MIT presented Microsoft with further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the company's premises) and seeing what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptive" can find out how many people are in the room who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also dissociate the present by conversational groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that he is not part of the group he talks to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's going to see anyone, and she tells her that she's going to be there in a moment.
All of this without the blue screen of death.
Impressive.
But, of course, that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of Windows operating system.
This week, there was a lot of talk about changing the Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial surpluses, they'd be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discovering as a thunder when we consider that Microsoft version adds new features and other "extras" to Windows.
A change of course would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to understand between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something in secret.
That's right.
It never disappears, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, to more web browsers.
The computer is switched on to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around the windows.
What does half the applications that accompany the system serve?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a little example.
I took this photograph in one of the Microsoft employees' restrooms in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drink machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay in the new Windows Mobile 7 version was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's just count until 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computerized.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it on the Azuri coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one glow in the "Blood Diamond" of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in the "Kmotro" of Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniform of a muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into the calculation of his life roles, we can go down to the image of a typical muscle with a pointed moustache that lifts up the feces in the carriage circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton man's underpants, obsessive and no sleeves.
English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels at all others.
First of all, for his own lame name - although he is called humanly 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells it, was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, lovers of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' excels at the other high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (very insignificant) Belgian flag, which models have the most enamel patches as a detail in their neck.
And watch out, because the Belgian company isn't specializing in tank tops.
He also produces sweatshirts, vintage boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, Navy T-shirts, clothes for children, mini shorts...
Designed pieces for a comfortable underwear.
Although it's too bad they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, who will be a father, doesn't worry me."
Her great image did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small figures, is a woman full of life.
They're taking Cruz's sisters very seriously now.
It means a lot more to Monica than just that some pretty, famous girls will rent their name.
In Paris, Mango took part in the promotion event in its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company will sponsor.
She's heartless and shy and gets you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that my sister Penélope and I proposed for Mango this autumn-winter season, while attending the release of the second edition of "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in Opera at Valentine's honor.
So it was a challenging day, but it was also an exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango that you've been working for since the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the '50s and '60s, and we drew a lot of inspiration from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk dressed, combine and layer their clothes, and I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I liked my clothes for a while. I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house, talk about my aunt's closet, and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to watch me dress.
You know, we dancers are based on how we're being modified to feel good at our classes and exams when we look into the mirror.
And as an actress, if they give you a costume, then you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 recently, did you get a crisis?
No way.
I feel better than I've ever been before. I've had 30 fun.
I find that the woman is ready, she has experience, and she enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological hours don't scare me.
I've been doing what I want for a while, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father's concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will let my child experience happiness and raise him with great love.
As far as the movie is concerned, you've got a few premieres waiting for you last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to coming to the movies.
I come from the theater world, so I'm very impatient and restless, and I want everything right now, and that's not going to happen.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of La Ultima Hora and En Busca de la Tumba de Cristo.
By the way, how you're gonna like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the pier by Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to go to the pier as a model.
She just called me Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend the benefit show for her organization "Women for a Better Life", and the clothes that we've been performing - I've also picked two models from our collection for Mango - it's getting high and the profit was handed over to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things about her, and I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to show for charity, but if she asks me to do a stand, I'll do it too.
For the sake of third-world women, I will do what is necessary.
The drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in the blood will have to install an "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol control must install a system in his vehicle that prevents him from starting a car in drunk state or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Representation, according to which it is a pilot project which will take one year.
His goal is to get the driver back behind the wheel, which is why drivers will also have to take the course of the transfer.
The Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Automobile Safety Foundation (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics between 30 and 75 % of motorists accused more than once for drunk driving again in this state will be held as a steering wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to a vehicle measuring the level of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded above the permitted alcohol concentration.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and would have to be paid by the guilty person himself.
A study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that in the case of vehicles equipped with this equipment, 65% had been reduced during the first year of introduction.
In Spain, 115 people could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before it commits a criminal offence.
And in order to help introduce it, since the legislation can be implemented in the usual way, the necessary modification of criminal provisions requires a change of law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been installed in certain industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) proposal, which recommends installing this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without Peptoes
With British accuracy, in 17.40 hours, as was the programme, a Spanish air force plane arrived at the Presidential hangar at the airport of Benita Juárez at México D. F., where the prince and princess from Asturia arrived.
The sun had just fallen, but its rays had so far forced their eyes to stick with their hands in order to see a subsequent pair coming out of the plane.
Underneath the stairs was a Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked the cab driver on the street if he knew that a Spanish prince with a princess was coming to a state visit.
- Yeah, well, that's great, it's not going to get to the airport to recruit people... she's out of here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturia are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just outside the red carpet and military cordon, which consists of 27 marine soldiers ready to fire an honorable salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on the lips in a dark blue suit and a princess, very neatly dressed and with her hair spread out, has no usual "peptoes", apparently reported that in D.F. a storm threatens her.
Before they cross into the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile for photographers and pose for them.
One of the four largest in the city is waiting at the hotel’s door to be accommodated, and a Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them.
Best subsidized fashion price
It's probably not a better place in the world to announce the fashion price than Paris, and it's probably not a better designer and bonvivan than Valentino.
The company Mango has just announced the second year of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation to new talent in fashion.
The price is paid in EUR 300,000.
Belgjanka Sandrina Fasoli, winner of the first year, saw her proposals yesterday in the Manga exposition on the Haussmann Boulevard in Paris, number 54, and almost cried with the arrival.
Of course, it is the second largest trade of this company in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square metres.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank designers Valentino for taking part in the Presidency of the Competition Jury, have brought us to dinner in Paris's Opera Garnier in the end.
The company of Mango, decorated by the president's desk, looked even more amazing next to the most famous works of Chagall.
Nati, who, with a heart-broken grief over the recent death of her brother, did not show anything, wore the clothes of this brand and the jewels of ELAH, over which the breath was hidden, and hung in her son Luis - almost a two-foot elegán - accompanied Valentina in the head of the table for dinner to his honor.
Andik, the chief and owner of Mango's company, accepted the welcome and, as a true gentleman, stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, because they both offered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - handmade - pants and shirts and at dinner changed into long black dresses, took a night walk to Opera for the escort of Goya Toledo, showed us a bathroom exam room and caught one of the bars in memory of other times and marked "Grand plié".
Inés Sasterre didn't hold back from a tour of the palace's side buildings, but she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before leaving.
The next morning we were able to love the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Paris Intercontinental Hotel with his own linen and towels and asked in advance that no fragrances should be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - antistress number
Not 1,000, but 1000 plus one way to forget chaotic and excruciating everyday life.
And in order not to be small, all are summarized in one book that will bring 30 September to the bookstore of relaxation.
The alarm bell rings every morning at 7:00 a.m. for punishment, but it's even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in an accelerated rhythm that brings current life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
There are, however, not one or two ways to combat everyday exhaustion and problems of disengagement from the world of work.
No, the number's no bigger than 1001.
Susannah Marriottová outside the yoga position, classical massage and "spa" therapy gathered on the pages of her book a whole "me" of possibilities, adapted according to the taste and time possibilities of each individual.
The book is called "1001 Ways of Relaxation" and thanks to the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "guide" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins that restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off, and concentrate on reading.
Talking from sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something the day before, but the kids who talk while they're sleeping.
When this first happens, it may scare you, but it's really meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnoliciosis.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure they told many of you that he spoke from sleep last night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadicly (for example, once a lifetime in high fevers), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months ...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There's not one reason why she's coming.
Often it is associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresis nightlife (night aiding) or sleepwalking, but it may not be so.
As mentioned earlier, it may sometimes be accompanied by very high fevers, stress or upset situations.
In any case, it's a little of a case-by-case scenario.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, speak individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases of extreme force, it would be appropriate for a child to observe and consult an expert to find out if he has any problem that causes him great anxiety and thus manifests itself.
We said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do so by remembering a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to upset a child too much before he goes to sleep.
So look for peaceful games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or TV shows.
For very nervous children and those to whom work can be relaxed, relaxing techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
It will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
When a somnolactic occurs, try to remain calm.
Recall that she is harmless to a child and that the next day she will remember nothing.
Useful Advice
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're breaking his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and then he rests.
Remember, if you seem to be deeply troubled a few times after yourself, it would be appropriate to turn to counsel or find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid being tempted to question him and draw information from him.
It won't hurt because when he's asleep, he's not conscious enough to set his mind on things.
Besides, you will hear what he's saying, but you don't know what he's thinking, and that's why he's saying it, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're getting.
Never tell your child you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not for fun.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally.
After a long, thin period, Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellows created more chances and managed to turn one of them into a winner.
The game did not have during this encounter, in which the attackers were difficult to enforce, too fast.
After the first attempt by the captain of the guests of Kauffmann, who would only shoot from a distance at a hairline missed the connector, he began to have the Illhaeusern light on top and first the Funderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg, or also Diebold gradually came to tease the defense of Dannemaria.
On the other hand, he built a defensive wave in the middle of the court and left only an agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemaria with the names of Riah and Temporal, then after opening the score for the Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well situated to process the ball reflected after the previous Diebold experiment (53').
However, Illhaeuserna’s Gólman had long failed to enjoy it, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and leave his fellow players in weakness.
But Dannemaria was unable to pull out of it and eleven of the Illhaeusern, who had just retreated to "suffer" the defense, no longer caused any more trouble, except for the last seconds of the fight, when the ball flew very close to the pregnant one after a great confusion.
Sarkozy goes to meet angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride through Brittany.
In order to face the demonstration of the power of fishermen who have severely violated the access of several Breton and Normand ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to Guilvinec Port in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The last appointments promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit", and they hope to "come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen in order to obtain measures against the sharp increase in oil prices, which reached a peak exceeding the average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the speaker at the Elyse Palace, David Martinon 's president will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain their competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of seafarers.
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with insatiability.
On Tuesday morning, they performed the operation "bread" (operations slowly driving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10km of traffic.
The holiday port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter dam was established on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors demonstrated their determination on Monday, when they burned tires and pallets at the time of the Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc in front of the ports' fuel depots in Brest and Loritta, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel of La Manche, like Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where there were trams in the port, or Le Havre, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turball and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped an important refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act for themselves, until the Wednesday meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is scheduled to decide on Tuesday how to proceed on the way ahead and to participate in the preparatory meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the Heads of the State Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "they will not be brought to Paris", said Lilian Cariou, chairman of the Lorita fisheries union.
Fishermen from the profession who do not pay their oil tax currently pay about 50 cents per litre, however, believe that the threshold for the profitability of the ship is achieved only when the oil is below 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman Magnificent
The unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes bowed to the legend of the film and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies this year on the supply of 215 aircraft, through the threat of recession that hovers over the world economy.
The fourth flight constructor in the world, Embraer, retains his supply assumptions for 2008 with 215 equipment supplied, confirmed his President Fredrik Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian constructionist has a great deal of promise from the Chinese market, especially with a range of 30 to 120 seats on his aircraft.
To date, Embraer has added 41 instruments to Chinese clients within eight years.
According to AIG, 15 % of its assets are transferred
An American International Group insurer, who was given over water by the U.S. monetary authorities, is considering moving more than 15% of his assets to pay the $85 billion he received as a deposit, writes the weekly Financial Times issue.
The AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying the journal, which quotes the sources of the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG Board met on Sunday night to investigate the eventual transfer.
Any confirmatory statement could not be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and investment in private equity, adds FT.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, continues the FT.
The AIG must obtain cash as soon as possible in order to repay the loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank at the risk of US authorities confiscating 80 % of its capital, thereby decomposing it to the relevant ratio of the current shareholder.
Analysis of the historic session of Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) collapsed by 777,68 point at 10 365,45 point.
The biggest recent future collapse in its history (by 684,81 points) recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trafficking following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index with the dominant technological component lost, according to the definitive data after the closure of trading, 199,61 points and settled to 1,983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1, 106,55 points.
From the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally collapsed after an unexpected rejection of the rescue plan by the House Representatives Bank, a plan that would allow it to find some stability in the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 declined to provide the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he asked for.
Almost two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees that Congress is unable to accept a certain plan," says Lindsey Piegzaová of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted in a few days should not be "too late".
"If this project is indeed doomed to failure (...), the staff will immediately be handed over to Fed (American Central Bank, see para.) and to other central banks in order to overwhelm the crisis, which would strengthen the credit conditions," noted Brian Bethhune, head of Global Insight's economists.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza said that in the United States "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After Friday's collapse, Washington Mutual organized the acquisition of Bank Wachova's bank's banking activities by its Citigroup rival.
In Europe of the crisis, she suddenly took turns and demanded immediate intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets do not deal "only with the US crisis, but with the world crisis", the analyst from FTN Financial added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
Income from the voucher fell to 3,632 % on Friday night compared to 3,827 % on Friday night, yield on 30 years to 4,161 % on the day before 4,357 %.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate was followed, the task of which was to find out who the couple John McCain and Barack Obama had won.
The leaders of the campaign of the Republicans and Democrats did not surprise each other when they both declared their victory in a television duel, which was followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, as decent as it was, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, the decline in the polls.
Gallupa's Constitution, published on Saturday by a public opinion poll, imposes a five-point lead on Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), considers that a Democrat is the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters that mattered right now, Obama is a winner for 39% of the respondents, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% is awarded the McCain victory.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his associate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's loaded," Bill Clinton said on the weekend, however.
Seventy-six McCain has consistently raised his irrefutable experience in foreign policy, while stressing his opponent's 'naviquity' on the issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"It seems Senator Obama didn't understand that..." there was repeated accusations.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have sufficient experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In such an offensive spirit, there have been TV spots yesterday.
On the other hand, Obama pointed out that he was representing the future.
He didn't lose his head and he turned out to be brief and precise.
He raised his ability to make the right decision and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"MccCain still did not understand, while Obama did," said a democratic video on the weekend, which tells the Republic that it does not sufficiently take into account the impact of the crisis on the "current American".
"In the course of the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered for the North Carolina election meeting for the heavy rain.
He didn't even say "medium" or "working." The financial breakdown clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider more likely to save the economy at the edge of the abyss.
"The next week could be a decisive turning-off," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "economic insight" to what Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of the eight-year-old poor economic policy, as ran by George Bush and as supported by Senator McCain".
The Illinois Senator once again confirmed that through the unexpected Wall Street jumps he should manage to reduce taxes to 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that the realization of the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is his number one priority, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain's planning to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have carefully avoided issues relating to the $700 billion (EUR 470 billion) financial assistance plan, which Congress adopted last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after the election rooms were closed on the main square in Minsk to protest the irregularity of elections to Parliament.
Although no results have been reported so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: 'Dictionator, Demis'.
Some admit that they didn't even say, "What's the point of doing what they want with my voice anyway," says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, which include the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian sex workers and the freezing of certain assets, could be cancelled if the election is considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, it wasn't like that.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," complained Juri Potemkin, spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," emphasises Alexandr Milinkievič, the former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, and the leading personality of the pro-European movement, "because it is essential who is counting the votes, and with us it is the executive power.
If some opposition MPs enter parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into Parliament may mean space on television, meetings in regions and draft laws."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because 'a dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
After all, our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, will be affected by the crisis and we will not reform, we are threatened to become a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the elections, does not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of the voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"Have you noticed that there have been any elections?" is the socio-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"There was no foot in the election rooms.
And there will be as many as five opposition Members in Parliament as possible, those who are most in line with the regime."
The nightly silence was once again enjoyed in the paradise square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and the Central Election Commission members congratulate each other on their success.
Conversation - Blood That Is Sure Again
Héma-Quebec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding yesterday, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced because Hema-Quebec became one of the most reliable and inefficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after the scandal of converging blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is commonly known, the state blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee was contaminated in the 1980s by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the wave of violence, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, which was chaired by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and making recommendations not to repeat such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying the release of the report, some provinces put in motion a committee designed to plan a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Québek, the Geline Committee took this role.
After Gélineau and Krevere's report, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Héma-Quebec, who was to hold Québec, and Canada's blood company to supply all provinces and territories.
"When Hema-Québec began his activities in 1998, 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system," Décary recalls.
"The situation was depressing.
With a consistent effort to increase the safety of blood products and work in this area, we have regained public confidence over the following years," he says and proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008, Héma-Quebeku trusted almost 94% of the Québé population.
Dr. Decary, however, does not lose sight that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has applied the principle of prudence.
"When we were in Europe, we witnessed the occurrence of many cases of a disease of mad cows, new variants of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says a woman who has been leading society since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea that this disease could spread in blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the main recommendations of Krevere and Gélineau, which, if we do not know and when a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, must be taken with exception.
Thus, in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who had abstained in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proved that this disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that to follow the principle of prudence made sense."
In 1999 a much more accurate technique appeared on the market to detect the HIV virus: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in donor blood, and not the presence of antibodies on which tests were used before.
NAT tests have reduced the deafening period between the patient’s infection and the moment our blood techniques can detect the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and without even realizing it.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
One of the 12 million people is exposed today to the risk of receiving HIV - related blood.
"In other words, before someone infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years for the first case of transmission of HIV through the blood product to occur.
I believe that today we can get the blood transfusions needed to heal in complete peace," says Head of Head Hém-Quebek.
"The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of fetal element in the system can appear.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by stabbing the insect.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," Dr. Décary continues, stressing that, in addition to safe supply, Hema-Quebec must also count on sufficient supplies.
"The needs are growing because the population is ageing.
Because of the more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The population's ageing also has implications for the blood donation network, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecians admitted to donation."
Every healthy person at least 18 years of age, corresponding to the eligibility criteria, but he can donate blood only once in 56 days, that means six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not accepted on average because, for example, they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where poor winters are kept, they are excluded for one year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Weaknesses are very rare.
Members of the donor network, however, need to be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
But to convince people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life today is so inconceivable that we will rarely find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary will fast.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only delivers blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hem-Quebek, which also manages the only public blood bank from the umbilical cord in Québek.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedicine waste, has blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of blood samples from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we assume that we will collect over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of next year we should start offering them for transplants," explains Dr. Decary, who describes the blood collection program from the umbilical cord as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they have no access to him," because Hema-Quebec does not have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Québec.
Football - Impact in semifinals
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinal series of the first USL division, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over Sounders from Seattle.
The publisher Antonio Ribeiro gave a decisive goal in the 90s play.
David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, the remaining two goals of the montreal formation, were posted after the two bulletproof first halfs.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of Sounders.
Remember that during the first of the first of the two quarterfinals on Friday, he suffered Impact in Starfire Complex, Tukville, in the suburbs of Seattle, defeat 2:1.
Impact dies in the semifinal of its strength with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder settled in the home game deficit 3:1 and eventually won 4-3, but Whitecaps still stepped into the semifinal wheel with a total number of 5-4 goals.
Impact should encounter Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the match series will be confirmed today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first Troika Attack Canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit composed of Alex Kovalova, Tomáš Plekance and Andrej Kostina yesterday night at Centre Bell led an attack on the victory of Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kostin, the biggest star of collision, scored the goal, Plekanec gathered two assistants and Kovalev collected one prize in this fourth victory of three-colored out of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured victory by giving a single goal during the separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
"I need one more fight to make me feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to do too much," observed Guy Carboneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice Applause."
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year
Immediately after the meeting of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where in today's complementary elections, the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running.
"Move away the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visibly seductive manner at the end of the meeting of the Liberal side of Québec in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were presented behind his back in some sort of painting mill.
On three rounded canvasss there was a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Largest means, as in the electoral period.
At the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out early elections in the fall, although he pointed out that he had a very busy program.
The "Sever Plan" is the fourth dimension of the "vision" which the Prime Minister intends for Québec, a vision of "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on labour, a convention between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - Northern Territory to the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently mentioned frequently in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "major potential jewel", but did not state the date, the amount of investment, or the clear priority in future projects.
He mentioned at the outset several approaches to points that could be further distributed: especially water power plants, forests, but especially the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
The North, according to Charest's calculations, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "land twice the size of France is with us", "is in Québec.
And it's not just us, but it's in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that there's a certain national founding myth going on.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, raised the prime minister: the pursuit of gold in Abitiba, the Québian engineering, the James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he sattrally silently to look at a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of the territory of Québek, includes part of Labrador, which Québec has always requested, specified the prime minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditional attitude that has repeated all governments so far.
There is one border line that has long been out of the Convention, and if there is a suitable opportunity, in the name of the government, I will retake this position," he indicated.
Otherwise "it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North," he said when he said about the Northwest transition, which as a result of the iceberg's melting, will open up throughout the year.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that the occupation of the territory becomes an obligation.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Québec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially young ones.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequistic MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The activities were initiated by the Inter-ministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but the moment when "the visions together" will be set out.
Finally, the development of the North should be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Sever plan will "jointly be designed, structured and environmentally friendly", promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a continuous follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers that preceded him.
"Just as the liberals who preceded us, we changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This, however, was one of the still shaken topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail extenuating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s coming to the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross Beauharnois' headquarters at the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who carried out the calm revolution and the nationalization of the water supply, to Bourass, who created James's Bay, managed our side to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, and yet to the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, premiered between 1957 and 1963.
When a series of Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power plants arrived, Charest stressed that its launch was scheduled for 2012.
"I'm only saying this between us, but I intend to be there," he confided to his member base, causing considerable applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would not be elections in 2008 and undoubtedly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of elections in the fall of this year, allowing him the law.
However, he stressed that his program was loaded, especially with the missions of the federal council in China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend's convention provided the leader of liberals with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "prospects to change the constitution", which went very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal side of Québek) requires the recognition of the "specificity of Québek" in the Constitution.
It also wishes Québec to appoint a part of the Canadian Broadcasting Council members who would have the veto in the case of decisions taken in Québec.
On the opposition side, the Sever Plan was skeptically adopted in its main features.
Chief of PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois again pulled out the Development Policy of North Québek, launched by Landry's Government in 2001.
According to her, when the Government of Liberals came to power in 2003, it renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she had stuck to it, "we would have been on today," Marois pointed out to her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the Sever Plan in government.
"We accept, however, that it should not be a mere theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumont, who is coming back from the holidays today.
Letters - Disgruntled Land
He was Vic Toews, an ex-minister of "justice" at Harper's Cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say about Louis Arbour that he was a "hanba" for Canada.
In this way, a woman who led an unscrupulous struggle for justice, who deserves all our admiration, says a lot about the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government ahead of us, which, as one of all the Western countries involved, has not returned to the homeland of its citizen imprisoned in Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not consider at all that Omar Khadr was a young adolescence at the time of the actions that were to be committed against him.
The only government that, although Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets the child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to judge the defendant.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and in particular the Canadian Lawyers Association, defend the repatriation of Omar Khadra to Canada for a fair trial.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: little does it matter that this young man next time is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly permanently after so many years of torture.
We do not realize this, but we are witnessing the plentiful erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the words that Harper has so much to defend and which out of his mouth sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no more morale: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, ill deal with him, to imprison him according to the liboval of the head of the minority government (after October 14th...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that declares virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and seriousness of our country.
The shame is, Mr. Toews, in this waiver, and not elsewhere.
Views - Orwell's Discurs of Barrick Gold
On September 17th, Le Devoire published a letter from Patrick J. Garvera, Executive Vice President of the Canadian Mining Company Barrick Gold.
With orwell logic, it confirms that the world's largest gold producer initiated the prosecution of three authors and poor little librarianism for insulting honour in order to create a "transparent public debate" and requires six million.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truth, especially in the case of prosecutions for insulting honour, but in the law.
It is no surprise that Garver completely misses this fundamental distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate to bring anyone to the table, who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the process occurs, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend honorable sums in order to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a very unequal fight against the army of lawyers supported by almost helpless pockets of mining society.
Tactics in these incomparable battles often rest in the ruining of the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will tighten the mouth of the opposing party and, in addition, shake anyone who dares to do so.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of the whole matter to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada there is a debate under normal circumstances in exchange of ideas, not in the wounds of a shoe.
Thus, mining companies were not enough to open their books, their documentation, and to create a real debate through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light into the whole thing.
However, Barrick Gold appears to have no confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Maybe Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" and at the same time disdain the opinion of the same public?
It seems that this word in the Vice President's world denotes only fat-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; it is a rather narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy, they have the right to speak even nactiuthrax.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports authors and publishers Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is prepared to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, not in what many see as an action in which the defendant's mouth is to be shut down (as part of his "public debate" complaint, Barrick, by the way, has just called on Noir Canada's authors to officially announce that they are to stop using this term ...).
If we ignore Garver's surreal speech, the prosecution of the initiated Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university freedom to explore and seek the truth that is essential to any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote credible sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics that the wealthy companies of this world do not like without exposing themselves to repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could be created if it followed the scientific standards used by the authors Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong is already remotely capable of managing debates and disagreements and resolving conflicts.
Barrick Gold's exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to lead a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would limit this type of illegal prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest rescue economic plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan, with the help of $700 billion in America, to curb the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it foresees: better control by elected representatives of its application, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of saved public money, new measures to capture the number of houses seized for failure to pay, and the right to monitor the wages paid to managers saved by companies.
US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi and the Republican Representative at the table of the Rules of Procedure, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration's representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and the common Americans are safe from the crisis just underway on Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"This is a crucial point: if we don't do it, trauma, chaos and disruption of the everyday lives of Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last hours, negotiations have been conducted on the maximum turnout of fear of the effect that further failures to set up investors should be made.
The time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were invited to negotiate later and both expressed themselves rather for an agreement without forgetting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such a far-reaching solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed an agreement on certain measures, in particular those aimed at enabling owners to maintain their place of residence, and measures on the network of directors of the state-owned companies.
"If we ask the taxpayers to take special measures for the irresponsibleness of some people, there is nothing to be congratulated on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the waves of television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The gross features I have read show that it is something that we will all have to spend and by which it will be possible to move on.
Choosing inactivity is simply unacceptable," he said.
The aim of the 700 billion-dollar plan is to buy doubtful claims and risk-free assets from US financial institutions for taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis caused by the crackdown on the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then moved to further, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in cash freeze and the decomposition of banks and financial institutions.
Last week's first draft of the agreement is being breached by the Republican Members.
From the moment the Democrats came to believe that for some of the "toxic" assets of the trouble-ridden companies, the government would only be in debt, but would not buy them out, there is a belief that the non-exhaustive situation is overrun.
In an effort to bring the conflicting views of Congress closer together, measures have been taken to establish that the government will be able to introduce new charges that would help it to recover its contribution if, as a result of the programme, it had to absorb losses for five years.
The new plan is counting on the first amount of 250 billion to be added to the next 100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The contribution of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in saved companies that will pay him dividends in the event of profit and that he will be able to resell when it's over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for the confiscation of properties associated with loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits for the amount of valuation and compensation paid to managers of affected companies.
The plan's architects would like to vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes were raised against this project both in the Republican and in the democratic camp.
"It's absolutely obvious Washington can't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Financial Commission.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money on taxpayers is not a solution."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen named "the skeptics' committee", presents the whole thing differently, but there is the same conclusion.
"There are four respected professors of economics, three Nobel prize winners among them, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reiterated in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial birth of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg has become necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it has deviated from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the brink of collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis of risk loans to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers.
"We're not going to make this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wuter Boss yesterday.
"In return, we get voting rights in the bank and influence.
And it's the stewards and households of today that are not sure how to appreciate it."
On the other side of the La Manche channel, it seems the British government has launched the birth of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government had to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) formed loans to buy real estate.
According to his announcement yesterday, the British Bank's branch offices and client accounts will be purchased by the Spanish Bank of Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government must be born from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with azur's eyes long represented his trump, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor with the charming smile of narcissism come out?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unscrupulous talent that he owned also distanced him from the power category that produces real stars.
But what a long journey it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at his 83-year-old ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last fatty years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, who was similar to him, and for a long time he was kind of his rival on the film screen, Newman was a more careful actor, certainly a fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakup of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother of Hungarian origin.
One of the famous faces of the American dream was born of these European roots.
Without excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw this whole country falling in love with self-made mana, a warrior in the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s, then visited New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theatre, on television and the corner of the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who placed himself as the second in the 24 hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although since 1958 he had been a model couple with Joanne Woodward.
It also leaves the shadowy places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the habit of own show-business, which will forever remain to a certain degree mysterious.
A decent man, in the most noble of words.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused a dizziness on movie lovers, while his great role together rivals the black canvas memory.
After it defines more than half a century, American seventh art is constantly changing.
In memory of the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a hot roof, the adaptation of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
From a less ancient past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans went into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, abused, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Someboda Up There Likes Me (In a Sign of Hate) Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 introduced Newman into real knowledge.
Sympathic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Possition), Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive bowling player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), also an artist at The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, bringing him the only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face that's been wandering forever, that's him.
And again, he.
In his professional path together, he rivals different eras.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the cult Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Coen Brothers.
His career then closed the role of the godfather of the Irish mafia in the Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, which soon left the trade, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its goldsmiths, omens and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "a live underplaying challenge" to judge that in his performance he pushed too hard on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman whose role came as a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
But the first lovers played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, robbers and losers, whose falls and riots reflected in his perfect features.
As director of Newman, he discovered few familiar pages of his shy sensitivity.
His film, Rachel of 1968 (according to the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife, Joanne Woodward, played the lead, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
He dedicated his son to Scott, who was lost due to overdose, in 1984, to Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sadness.
In the honor which Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former fellow soldier Robert Redford (played together at The Sting and at Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Pride, love of life, such are the main characteristics of a deceased actor.
If we ignore his legendary career, there is also a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opposition to the fall of Hollywood.
We used to see his likeness on wine vinegar bottles, sauces, on biscuits and other foods, which might have seemed quite inseparable, although at first it was a gag.
However, profits from the sale went to his Foundation's account for difficult childhood.
Newman's been working in the company for the last minute, rather than letting himself get caught up in the glory.
He left his five daughters a letter containing the following sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor to watch the life course of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the factory on the invoices Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, October 8th, a trial against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Politicians and their associates are accused of fraud committed in the long term by a systematic criminal organization, which has resulted in particularly significant damage, in addition to other crimes, including counterfeiting of documents.
According to the prosecutor's office, they used the money obtained in public competition for their own purposes and often documented the fulfilment of their tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and government - about 65 million forints - traveled in part to the Treasury of the Fiatal Balladal, in part to the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money obtained in the public competitions was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real valuation and the commitments made by the association had never been received.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoices were fake.
Printed copies of these invoices came from the Yozsefváros market, a round stamp was produced in Kiskunhalas.
On the name of the companies to produce invoices, she decided, among other things, on a circular road along the northern shore of Balathon, to which she sent Istwana Lados János Zuschlag.
According to his statement, he was first appointed to look at pensions and restaurants.
In them, he asked for accounts for his consumption, according to which invoices submitted in the context of public competitions issued by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and respect for the Government of the capital, were subsequently produced.
The invoices were mostly exhibited by Istwan Lados with his partner, András
On his "study trip" Lados looked up a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this catering facility provided for a 90-member Biztos Pont group.
However, so many people would not suddenly fit into this facility, according to the company’s management.
In the summer of 2002, the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, were also lined up with formal and content errors.
The Badacsonytomai guesthouse had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, it was also exaggerated by the plenipotentiaries of rich fantasy, when they cited documents of the same hospitality company Pigal s.r.o., in which the records provided to the State's representative appeared in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppa and did not make any adjustments.
Head of Győző Farkas pro hvg.hu stated that when he was summoned to the prosecution and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to the formalities, the fact that hundreds of people were accommodated according to the invoice did not agree, for they only have eleven rooms with so little capacity.
In addition, food was also mentioned on the invoice, and their restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The zealous invoice manufacturers did not even know that the announced Budapest travel agency is organizing only foreign travel, and the cash invoice, which was also inconsistent with the invoicing practice of the company, they foolishly referred to as a service of intermediation of the trip to Hungary.
In addition, as was the case during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although the organisation of roads to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
The four documents exhibited by the Jobb Jövőért by Hotel Révfülöp s. r.o. did not agree to VAT, among other things. The company's activities were not covered by the said 25 %, but by 15 % VAT, while the employees of the hotel were only displaying printed invoices, but the invoice was written by hand.
In addition, the "issuers" of the invoice were ruined by the fact that one company was shown to be the result of an investigation by the State representative, as an activity carried out by the road transport of goods that the company originally based on investment advice did not perform.
The fact that the invoices are issued by the Együtt Foundation and the Harmadik Évezredért and XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have also failed due to formal deviations - an inadequate invoice format and an incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or Sport Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would expose the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that HiIB s. r. o. from Nyíreghygaz was also denied by the company's Fiatal Városért group at the time of (2001), in liquidation, that is why according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he would issue the paper.
The invoices were made consciously
The second group of invoices consists of those who knew they were supposed to expose a fictitious invoice.
Esély Budapest has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Balladal - Ifju Szoccialistak.
The Leading Company Collab s. r. o. made one of the defendants of Ludovic Györfi subject to the indictment.
The company Biogate s.o. also collaborated with Zuschlag and his associates, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and Atlas and Vörösfenyő invoices worth about five million forints for which there was no real economic activity.
Not even the movement of money, because the invoices created were later reversed, which the organizations have already forgotten to mention in their documents.
Other groups of invoicing companies include those who had links to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was appointed representative of the Ukrainian head of Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company displayed several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found in the investigations, these invoices were purchased by Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment Ltd, which had been disposed of since 14 September 2005.
One of the members of this company was a man from Romania who was supposed to hand over documents concerning Ivan Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the company he had issued invoices to Atlas, Hoppa and the Együtt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért and himself accepted their remuneration.
At the request of Ivan Kubatova, Romanian judges were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they didn't get the job.
However, the companies were to his advantage because, at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolta Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, he invoiced, on behalf of the companies, invoices to the Atlasz and Y-Generácios connected to Zuschla.
By name of companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Cubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State Department found that Cubatov had reached 10 per cent of the amounts on invoices and VAT.
To release fictitious invoices, this time to the selection procedure for Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Shi-Beri k.t.
The Y-Generácio and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals for the competition of the Mihalye Tancsicse Foundation (TMA), a publicly beneficial socialist party organisation in January 2006.
They received 500,000 forintech, but the amounts did not spend on the objectives indicated in the proposals.
In order not to show this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were finally found at the home search in the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the examination of the part of the defendants, it is likely that the processing of invoices will be described, as it has already done in the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if you decide to reveal everything to yourself the main defendant János Zuschlag.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will not do so until now, he has not done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for the compensation of a large part of the damage, 50 million forints, the socialists may have made a deal with him, and Zusi will take it on his own.
He could have been offended by the fact that his requests to alleviate the conditions for his detention, namely, placement in a home prison, remained unheard of.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes who have caused much greater damage that they have not yet compensated, they can walk freely or at least wait for the end of their conduct in their homes, he does not have that option.
Coffin Psychology: Why spend more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalue goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this famous - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to researchers from the field of neurology and economics of New York University.
According to their study, published in Science, people in the eBay auction competition do not want to hold back, so they would rather pay too much price.
Research by experimental auction attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers waged, the other group took part in a playful auction, with a functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active area of the brain of experimental persons.
In both games, participants could win the money, but during the auction, the important element of which is to rewind the other side, began to function intensively under the brain crust, called the striatum.
In addition to many other functions, this brain area plays a role in the "self-refunding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the investigators, it is possible to explain the effort to avoid a sharp reaction of the striath.
To support their theory, members of the research team carried out a financial cross-sectional investigation from a series of economists.
Under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made the bets.
In addition, the members of the other group were promised that if they come out of the game victoriously, they will receive another $15 reward.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members lost that money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, all in all, that one was stressed by the win and the other loss.
However, members of the group playing "against the loss" were willing to go higher than they were in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
For you have yet to explain the phenomena that are observable at auctions with joy of victory and avoiding the risk.
Until neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the gap between these two theories so that we have now reached the third explanation," stated Andrew Schotter, professor of the New York University Faculty of Economics.
Hepatitis: when can you find a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and this chronic liver disease is reported among the main causes of death in Hungary.
The number of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only 7,000 are being treated, and the reason is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name of the hepatitis is a summary of the names of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, there is a sign of inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the originator of the disease and the disease caused by them differs from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways, depending on the origins of the disease: hepatitis A and E by digestive systems (such as infected foods, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses of blood and body fluids (sperm, animal secretion, saliva).
Travellers should, in any case, protect themselves by vaccination against virus A and B, against the virus type C vaccine does not exist.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, usually associated with nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, nausea and vomiting.
After that, yellow, lighty stool and darkening urine will be formed on the skin and eye whites. The treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, millions of people worldwide will die of a more serious type of this disease, liver cancer, and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected medicamentalis is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to hepatic cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most people who are infected with their disease do not even know, the disease's cause destroys the liver cells in the background, so the first symptoms will occur in many cases in 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention, regular mapping is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more often than on average: among people who had blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and tattoo people.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C is 200 million.
Since the disease can demonstrate a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his or her practical physician if he or she detects any symptoms of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infectious diseases and preventing the formation of cancer.
September 30 is a world day of hepatitis, which was organised for the first time worldwide by organizations representing sick people.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of the virus, and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God, it doesn't hurt that much?
According to recent research, belief in God works as a certain analgesic that could make death easier for Catholic martyrs already.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, exploring how man’s belief influences God’s perception of pain, informed the British Telegraph Journal.
In a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to technology, a detailed examination of the human brain has also shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for controlling pain.
Research is the first in a series of studies attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was fully tested by attaching to the left hand of the test subject a sparking instrument that produced electric shocks.
The researchers asked participants to observe carefully two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary, dating back to the 17th century, and the Lady with Leonard da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would bring a certain state of godly devotion to the believers, while Da Vinci’s painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the first one and acted in a soothing way.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received four consecutive parts of 20 electroshocks, while separately monitoring the painting with religious or general themes.
The Catholics stated that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "in safety", as if they were taken care of" and "smoothed, filled them with peace".
They felt 12 percent less pain in watching the painting with religious themes than when they had Leonard’s work ahead of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved through any highly impressive image of atheists, only the right photograph should be found.
"We should find a painting that will feel very positive, from the position of the mother or father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The exercise of faith should change and, in many cases, will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such excellent results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the control of the pain of the believers if they showed them some of Leonard's madonous or similar caliber painting.
Would it mean a view of the quality of the Virgin Mary to achieve even better results?
You're what you're gonna share.
On his tenth birthday, Google can declare that people can find him in their pocket at least as well as in heaven above their head; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations are going on, and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, it's still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics are concerned by the parallel with orwell's dark vision, the very essence of the web 2.0 is not clear.
Eric Schmidt recently said to the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google’s founders to keep their original intention, which was to: “Let’s arrange all the information in the world!”
According to the representative of Google, even after ten years of secular work, it is only at the start of working with all the information.
To the question of what will be in five years' time, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would I do for me?" - to such seemingly simple questions, however, software will not be able to answer until they know enough about users.
Not all internet users know very well that during the internet search, the exact words you are looking for are captured even from which IP addresses were searched and to which websites the interested persons have moved to.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can for example keep the history of their surfing, they can look back at what they've been looking for and what they've clicked on, thus creating, in the long term, findings tailored to much more directly to them - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations service, through which the system will be based on the previously mentioned and retained preferences to offer products and services.
What if my data will be used against me, what if someone looks at me, what do I do? - ask users who are afraid when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the range of potential powers represented by the company is threatening, the counter-action does not raise the awareness of guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even the rebellion against power on the Internet.
However, it is confirmed that all searching terms are not only captured, but, in justified cases, may also be issued by a third party, in such legal cases, the personal rights of internet users will not be protected.
The most famous example of recent times was probably coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which he provided Google’s Brazilian government with information enabling the identification of paedophiles from the community sites of Orkut established through it.
However, Internet users who are concerned about personal rights could still breathe in May when the company's hand in hand with the EFF's electronic rights organization successfully proved its truth in the dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced in the future to provide any information that the FBI secretly requested.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought almost 50 000 web addresses and thousands of searching terms, which it obtained by calling for reinforcements before the years of the adopted Child Protection Act, yet it failed to obtain the lists of individual users' searched entries, respectfully full websites and key words covering a period of two months.)
The Google view is so controversial: it is bullied by those who fear to provide their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by starting using Google services, exposed to injury, and taking action against them with a revolution that belongs to multinational companies with conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild foothold, grouping around itself enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees a new generation of bigfire, "corporation, which is now freting," unlike its Microsoft rival, considered by Windows as the world's conqueror, as well as fighting for the same goals.
This can be caused by Google’s not requiring the identification code from its users, and does not want money for its applications; open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as a much more accessible, more youthful, "cool", than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it can also be caused by geeks precisely understanding the very problematic relationship between the Internet and the personal rights, which has brought with them just one of the most perverse keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave behind traces and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their range for each other remains the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can profile on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, recording it by listening to music, all of which can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, while writing a blog on which his latest photogallery will automatically appear on Flickr or Picasso.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of empirical cases from which he explains: a friend in the morning when he looks at the flood pictures of fellow friends easily comes to the point with which her crazy friend spent the evening, or the company can fire his employee simply because on his blog he will take his honest view of top management: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely reevaluated today.
The person living an online life consists of what he will show, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid the Googlovsky monopoly has the option (i.e. Scroogle, which uses Google's search engine, does not deliberately leave a trace).
For example, a small number of people do not sign up on community sites on purpose, so that they cannot be found. Online Google apps from the text editor to the photoeditor and the news portal can be replaced for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which will not build the most quality profile.
Public opinion doesn't expect too secretly when Google shows his teeth.
The company has a $156 billion higher current value than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola (110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas are threatening the investment of advertising agencies and services that are constantly being implemented at an accelerated pace seriously disrupt the lives of not only Microsoft but also numerous other software designers.
However, critics also find counterpoints acting with a disturbing impression: the top management, for example, completely rejected the employees' protests after raising twice the fee for the company's kindergarten, any frequent daily diet of employees was too expensive according to the company's management, all of which is lost, in addition to the fact that in 2006 Google leaned before the Chinese government and, in the sense of their agreement, filtered out every find that results in good taste, respecting the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules seems to have never been able to find new services in advance, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can move the world to new places: while some believe that Google's project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the American Supreme Court, others are terrified of its health system, in which we can build a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database, then it can serve as a good starting material for future generations of sci-fi writers, the famous revision of Cory Doctorow "Scrooview" describes with orwell's reminiscences a future in which one can be horribly well approached only with Google data.
A double killer from Odessa was helped to remove the traces of two juveniles
Two juveniles questioned the police in the case of a double murder in Odessa, suspected to have helped with the removal of traces of this crime, said the Chief Police Directorate of Borsod County on Tuesday.
Persons who have been suspected of activity have experienced and are currently charged with aiding a criminal offence.
Both young people, according to MTI information two girls, are being prosecuted for freedom.
Assistance to a criminal offence shall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
Suspect of a double homicide in Odessa, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a criminal charge pre-planned multiple homicides for profit reasons.
The investigation revealed that a 23 - year - old man owed a 53 - year - old man a larger amount.
The suspect didn't want to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor into a firm in Odessa last Wednesday, where he killed a man first and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing for the crime in advance, which is also evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder of a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapons and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of the experts.
Varšavská burza made an offer to buy Prague stock exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for buying a 100% package of shares by the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolevski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party even though the Czech Warsaw Stock Exchange had already ruled out new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech Economic Journal E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered so far by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech lists, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic share exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börs have still made offers.
The chief of the Prague stock exchange, Peter Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by the stock market experts to be 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with around 25% share, followed by Czech savings with 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
Financial crisis from the perspective of the European leaves
In their Tuesday comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European lists already resemble the "second of September 11th".
For a global financial disaster, we can thank the U.S. President, who holds the charges of Rome La Repubblica. The President has not even been able or has not been able to arrange for his own party to support that fast-track draft law, which aims at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, a billionaire and investor named Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second of September.
Also part of the Madrid press sees a guilty man in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the world economy has led to the collapse of the lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system continues to grow, for which the world will eventually pay.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after voting in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to solve the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in capitalism history is taking place.
The threat can no longer be forgotten, says the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a lifesaver around the returning monetary institutions, and taxpayers can save them from ruin.
However, if other banks collapse as cubes, then money or other improvisation will no longer be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to transfer themselves through their national selfishness and to unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the postponing monetary institutions received more than EUR 100 billion, recalls the Vienna Der Standard, which, according to which there are concerns that, like Americans, they will have to reach deeply into the pockets of European taxpayers, as well as more real taxpayers, in order to resolve the crisis.
The European Union is in crisis, which, as tsunamis, is rolling through the old continent, until now, it has not really dealt with it.
"Secretaries" need not immediately wave the billions of euros, but it would be good if they firmly determined in which case it is reasonable to seek the money of taxpayers to avoid further damage.
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would perhaps be the best method of developing technologies to prevent precipitation, if not imitation detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
A bee, for example.
The starting strategic idea of a surprising project presented at the Japan CEATEC fair was inspired by engineers from Nissan bumbleca. It was about how to build a new generation of precipitation-prohibition systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has constructed a biomimetic robotic control system of type BR23C, a robotic miniauta, which is equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all precipitation.
"On the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is in fact very much like our security package," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of the brand for the field of technological PR and research and development.
An important role is played by folded eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions in the visual angle more than 300 degrees.
Engineers were involved in copying the function of a composite eye after the idea of a laser long-range meter.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 metres before BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor that immediately turns into an operation to prevent precipitation.
The obstacle is caught during a fraction of a second, then the robotic car begins to imitate the movements of the bees and the rotation of the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision from changing immediately.
Unlike any existing system, this dynamic manoeuvre is carried out in an entirely instinctive way.
"If it hadn't been for that, a robot car could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and the most internal layer of the safety package within which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards, or in an angle, it can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction that can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees while avoiding, only speeding, acceleration and slowing has been applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, the important instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, is thus less data storage.
This mechanism must process and react to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to store them and react using intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers data, so he is constantly using only a memory of a few kilobytes.
He doesn't need a giga or megabyte capacity memory.
This is the first step towards developing a technology for immediate avoidance, which is estimated to reach a series of manufactured vehicles within ten years.
Another option of application may be to connect a unit to a satellite GPS navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles, would lead the motorist to a given ultimate goal.
Damned dear child already has a name.
The $700 billion Savings Economy Package Act, which is to be divided into several instalments and whose purpose is to buy out poor bank loans, is already in writing.
In the first round, half the amount will be used.
After further negotiations, which ended on Saturday after midnight in the Americas, Congress officials reached an agreement in a few days' ongoing debate on a rescue package worth a total of $700 billion, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," announced Nancy Pelosiová, the Democratic President of the House of Representatives, according to which only the conclusion of the agreement is left.
The compromise concerning the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said of the result of the compromise: "The programme will work and it will be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. in Washington time (then on Monday at 2 p.m. in the middle of Europe), but no special rise in the stock exchange did.
On the proposal for a legal standard hearing on the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stability Act, which is to be set up, the House of Representatives will vote on Monday first, and then it will be senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then they welcomed the deal in the White House.
"With the progress that has been made at night, we are satisfied and very much appreciate the efforts made by both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said White House Speaker Tony Fratto.
The programme differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, in which it was intended that a total of $700 billion should be spent on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
Now it is possible to spend 700 billion in the first half of the amount around it, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the Congress decides on things expected on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy for them securities secured by mortgages that are rated as poor, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be audited by a special council, which will also be a member of the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next Congress decision.
The Ministry of Finance may, within the meaning of the law, apply a combined approach: it may at the same time buy out quality loans, mortgages and securities provided by mortgages, respect other "domestic" loans.
Repurchase may take place within and directly within the auctions, the competent representatives of the Ministry have reported.
The legal norm will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Ministry of Finance provides them with guarantees for the means of concern and the company will pay the price corresponding to the amount of the damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to make up up to $700 billion in the emergency requirements of the US financial system, whether it is a massive purchase of bad funds, insurance or a prevention of systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major monetary institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, the chiefs of the bank, who have been in trouble waiting for the state's help, can count on the government to reduce their distance - to which the overseas slang is simply called a "golden parachute".
Only in certain cases will their payments be reduced, and these restrictions will depend on the way in which they are provided to the ministries.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys in the course of an auction, a tax deduction will be imposed on the golden parachutes if the directors of the bank are not sent straight to retirement.
In the case of direct redemption of quality loans, the government will aggressively take steps to ensure that the money for management is not exaggerated.
It is necessary to add that the existing contracts on gold falling do not change, the restriction relates only to new contracts, which should be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history where the legal restrictions on remuneration of directors will apply," commented the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives, Democratic Barney Frank.
In addition, the State in the participating banks will have the right to acquire a share, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and together with it and the saved bank are put on their feet, they can also make a profit on the transaction.
The plan of the proposal states that in the next five years the President must submit to Congress a proposal determining how taxpayers can be reimbursed the expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
"This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, for this will not protect the dollar of taxpayers," said the Republican Congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street insisted on the adoption of the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 and then by 12.9 per cent in comparison to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
Export sales prices in the industry were 1.1 per cent higher compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent annually.
Production prices in the industry were 0,7 % higher than the previous month, as the cause of changes in domestic and export prices increased by 3.2 % each year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by at least 0.1 per cent due to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices in the manufacturing industries also increased slightly by 0,1 % compared to July.
The biggest price increase took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the monthly price increase of 4.6 per cent in the bras and saddlery industry, respectably footwear production by 2.5 per cent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials produced a significant monthly price increase in the chemical and product manufacturing sectors (1.6 per cent).
Prices decreased in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - at least - in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water sector, which has a heavy weight in domestic consumption, the price of 0,3 per cent increased in August, mainly by the continued impact of the officially determined increase in gas prices since 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic consumption in the various sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices increased the most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 per cent).
In the manufacturing sector, it was possible to observe 13,2 % in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products of a critical weight, followed by a 11 % increase in prices.
Price reductions occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent) and in the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0,6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent during last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water sectors have overcome prices from the previous year by 18.7 per cent.
In terms of division according to the sector focus, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the sectors involved in the production of tangible assets was observed in August in domestic sales.
In the manufacturing sectors of consumer goods prices increased by 0,3 %, in energy processing and further processing sectors, prices did not change due to the previous month.
The largest price increase due to the same month of the previous year was possible in August 2008 for energy processing and downstream industries (16.8 per cent).
In the manufacturing sectors of consumer goods, we measured an increase in prices of 6.8 per cent, while in tangible assets, prices decreased by 1.4 per cent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forintech increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, down by 3.9 per cent in a 12-month comparison.
Our domestic payment decreased by 1.7 per cent over one month, and due to the dollar by 7.1 per cent, compared to August 2007 it increased by 7.5 per cent and by 15.9 per cent in proportion to the euro.
Next year, no visas in the United States?
According to Kingy Göncz, it is high hope that the US-Madriatic Agreement on visa-free contact will enter into force around 12 January, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke in Chicago in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "it is now almost all that matters only if an electronic travel authorisation system, respectable controls, is built in time beyond the sea".
At the same time, she pointed out that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register before leaving.
The Hungarian diplomat has been holding meetings in Washington since today.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross to the Star of the Order for credit for the Hungarian Republic and will hold talks with foreign policy advisor Barack Obama's Democratic Party and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for the bank rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major American parties, provided on Sunday the government's $700 billion bailout package for their support, but there are also politicians who demand the demise of the minister of finance.
After several days of Congress and administration meetings, the basic agreement on the bailout package was announced on Sunday morning.
The financial package, which aims to overturn the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue for the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are considered to be more appropriate than the two candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, simultaneously with the way they reached the forefront of the economic issue, Obama gained some advantage again, and McCain’s lead was spread, which was secured by Sarah Palin’s post as Vice-President after the Republican convention.
Obama expressed on Sunday's election meeting in Detroit the hope that the package law of 700 billion would be adopted quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages concerning consumer protection, which he also supported.
"We must act immediately, responsibly... to your places, savings, the entire industry, the stability of the economy as a whole is at risk," he said in front of a 35 thousand crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain, in an interview given by ABC TV station, said, "It's all going to be a little bit... but nothing is going to happen."
As stated by the Republican Senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a committee overseeing the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the derogation to the top representatives on which he insisted.
Obama said to the CBS station that McCain had no more significant role in the negotiations, he himself was on the contrary with the minister in his daily contact.
The President of the House of Assembly, Nancy Pelosi, told on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the draft law on Monday.
Overview of the German language area
The justice camp is intact, only the voters inside it became more confident - so analyzes the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
Hader's men are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spielgel.de)
In the internet edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter discusses in his article entitled "Bavor Revolution Eats His Father" the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU's erosion began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over.
For decades, Christian socialists have restored Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, altering the period is a problem for all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The Debakl was not completely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday the process was concluded, which could have been assumed for almost ten years: an undisputed hegemony of one State party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, which is still so often mentioned in the Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernisation that the CSU in this country has consistently carried out and consumed by its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong at the pace. Secularizations, educational results, settlement of the Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without consequences for the integrity of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is linked to growth opportunities, which also has visible political consequences.
The justice camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more obstinate.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the CSU has been the most distant of the classic civil layers; people in free trade, tradesmen, individuals with degrees and higher education.
The CSU has already shrunk below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna Diary in its article entitled "Who, With Who? The presidents of the parties are in question the coalition of restraints" deals with the confused internal political situation created by the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP shall involve the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, the greens are not yet willing to negotiate on the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the presidents of the parties did not get much attention in their cards.
The president of SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wished to deal with ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some of the common countries and in the social partnership exists.
The question of whether he could introduce the coalition to Wilhelm Molterer, current President ÖVP, as vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As has been said, the Schüssel-Mutterer course has been voted out for each fall.
Repetition of this direction shall not be taken into account.
Molterer responded carefully to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere with ÖVP's internal affairs.
Whether his party chooses the opposition, or enters the coalition, it is yet to be completely open, these issues must be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider appeared open again in every direction.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
Jaróková: A vicious circle of poverty and segregation needs to be broken
In Paris today, the European summit of equality hosted by France this year, the current President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People's Party for the Fides movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert talks in her message addressed to the plenary, turned attention to segregation in school because it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The summit opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The panellists were among the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Euro Ambassadors Group, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination suffered in recruiting labour, Roma are forced out of the European labour market primarily by their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education, and as a result of poor quality of basic education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Jaráková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to establish the awareness of these links in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the more likely he will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"The Roma are the right of their national citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and guarantee the elimination of their under-quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the Member, it is necessary for the European Union to be coherent with the objective and to act in order to speed up the processes of school disaggregation, and this is of paramount importance to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"There is a need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to give Roma children the opportunities given by democratic space so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Jarók demanded.
The European Summit on Equality, held every year from last year's Berlin meeting, is guaranteed to ensure a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination at the level of Europe and the individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary grace
The fate of the surrogate duo Huber-Beckstein shall be decided by the end of October
Despite the disgraceful election debut, the debate on personal issues has been delayed by the tops of the Bavarian CSU so far.
The President of the Party Erwin Huber and the Earth Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their seats, the question is, as long as this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 per cent loss of votes, will be decided on the last October weekend by a special congress of the party.
In any case, the members of a very critical duea were told that they would not be able to keep up with their posts.
They tried to soothe the angry members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded a day after the "babor tsunami" to produce personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of her career - gained a Christian social union of 60.7 percent, now, year after year against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of her strength.
CSU was in Bavaria producing 18 per cent of German GDP "self-controller" for 46 years.
While conservatives in the Southern Federal Land continue to have a key importance for the Hungarian economy, they will have a high status, but in the future they will be forced to join the coalition.
One of the first signs of a reorganisation within the party is the fact that a member of a narrow task force that launches probe negotiations on the possible coalition of Munich's government with the liberal FDP, respectfully oriented by the rightful assembly of the Free Trade Union, will also be Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be a possible Huber's successor.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, a candidate for the Free Vote, came into the dream, whose performance against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to execute the coup, but then made an unmerciful short process with an ambitious communist politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, the active role will also be given to Stoiber, who has so far removed the strings from the background, the former prime minister of the Earth, and former CSU President called 28 September the most distressing day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made several angry notes to the CDU address, according to him, they would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to both CDU and Angel Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, is somehow put on its feet by common forces.
According to Merkel, who was hard at hiding her disappointment because of the fiasco, the CSU’s position will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Grand Coalition.
Which is relative, of course: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of social Democrats continues.
The SPD has achieved the worst result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko:position - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, not a single opposition Member entered the Parliament of Belarus.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country run by Alexandre Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE), the laws that occurred in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the 110-member Legislative Council of the 10 million-year-old country lacks the opposition for a good ten-year period, the opposition united under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who, on the basis of a change in the Constitution in the 2006 elections and a fourth renewal of his presidential mandate, would "allow" to appear in parliament several opposition Members.
The ODS has dropped this since the boycott that had been considered.
In the background of the opposition expectation, it was also in favour of the fact that Russia was increasingly dependent on Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of Russia's persistently pushing imports of natural gas, had taken credit and contributed to the failure of Beltransgaz, the country's owner of gas pipelines, to get into Russian hands - to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment, assessed as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-level politicians, did not obtain an entry permit.
It was previously pointed out that the OSCE, in its assessment of the election campaign, focused on positive developments and not on shortcomings - such as the ban on candidates for a third of the opposition candidates.
On Monday, however, the OSCE flash report already had reservations to the campaign, during which opposition candidates were virtually unable to appear in the press, especially to the fact that the opposition could not be present to collect votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released to freedom, and Minsk is willing to run with Moscow even to minor confrontations when he still refuses to recognise from Georgia the severed South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus is a party to the federal state, considers these two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that we have started dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said our letter Alexander Milinkevic.
According to the opposition presidential election candidate in 2006, it is desirable that this remain so, even though "it was too much to hesitate to leave a single opposition member in an insignificant parliament".
In view of the results of the opposition, he does not plan a protest, rather he tries to deliver his message to the voters about the necessity of economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, we have to print the opposition letters in Russia, distributing obstacles to local authorities, yet I see that the change supports more and more people, as well as among the elders," Milinkevic said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers social security to be its greatest success, does not consider it the right and officially the most supported category of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security's 'murdering silence' collapses," says Milinkevic.
Unlike the opposition policy, they valued the Russian election observers as democratic.
The Head of the Community Mission of the Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, Russian intelligence agency Ria Novośto, said that "people don't believe in words, but in deeds", so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that has been established a rotating door upon the arrival and departure of employees.
From now on, however, this new measure will start to work against those who push and then go to coffee during their working hours.
News against sloths was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunette, and the secretary-general of the President's Council, Maura Masi.
"The turning door - says Brunetta – are a tool for better work, higher performance, more gifts and more services," the minister explains.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency is opening up.
This is about reformism", also emphasizes Brunette.
We will complete the establishment of the Presidency of the Council in all the buildings of Chigi.
For Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of the staff, and the secretary-general assures us, "It was a joint procedure with the staff and cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast at work time; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunette smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."

In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months the absence of public workers for sickness has decreased by 50%, which means by 60,000 more people per year at work".
And add that it is necessary for Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its payday dynamics – explains the minister – have doubled over the past 8-10 years due to private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of public servants gathered to reject Brunette's regulations in line with the Codecons-supported request.
"The minister of public administration will present today the figures relating to the lower absence of work due to illness – writes the consumer protection association – the nation of 'stolen sloths' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree."
Taru will protest, above all, the exclusion of sickness allowances that depend on activities; the extension of the time within which the patient can be checked, in which the time range will be checked, and the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work injuries, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day 2,500 accidents will occur in Italy, three people will die and twenty-seven will remain permanently disabled.
Inail's estimates confirm that in 2007 we have around 1,200 deaths due to accidents at work.
These values testify to the severity of the penalty, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the death compared to murder.
In order to reinvigorate the attention of institutions, social and information resources on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates the 58th national day of the victims of workplace injuries on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data extended by Anmile and the same tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of job safety is," confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for the Frozen and Disabled for the Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses its lively admiration for continuing joint efforts on job safety, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and participation in public opinion."
"Naturally, an uproar 's enough' has been raised, frankly shared in the face of tragedies that cause media unrest and public opinion by their range, but daily reality offers us again dramatic cases, even recurring in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, numerous initiatives in the field of education have been taken to ensure that young people facing the world of work have a clearer understanding.
Attention should be given to this phenomenon, not giving up because of its worrying social seriousness, applying and improving legislative standards.
The president of the Gianfran Fini, for his part, stressed that "as a result of the death of a job, he creates an absolutely critical social state, insulting the conscience of each of us and forcing all the institutions to make a convincing effort to end this state of affairs."
"As far as the dates of the accidents are concerned, they seem to show a certain positive turnover, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from the accidents at work is equally alarming," said President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We just don't want this "trying to reduce" to cause less attention, because right when the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that there is still too little to do in general to stop the problem of accidents and there are many activities that may have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion - stressed Mercandelli - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training workers, right from school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - concerning communication and participation in public opinion.
Above all, there is a need for greater sense of responsibility by employers towards the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon .'
Mercandelli finally declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the right to compensation provided for the workers and the "retirement of support care", which the system has been receiving in recent years.
"The aim is to return the employee's insurance guarantee - he added – because the fate of those who hurt themselves is not dependent on spontaneousity or gifting from time to time by the legislator."
Mp3 players charged, exposed to risk
Listening to loud music for longer periods and using portable music instruments as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's notice by the European Commission, which in one official report circulated in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which has recently emerged and have been identified (Csrseri) by Eu.
"From this scientific point of view – we read in the notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years by means of portable musical instruments, each week more than an hour a day and maintain a high volume device, risk permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I worry that so many young people who use often portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly harm their hearing in an incorrigible way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – continues to lead – there is a clear risk and a rapid response is needed.
The most important thing is that we need to raise consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to review existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding, so that they become fully effective and keep pace with new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists – concluded Executive Officer Eu – confirm that there is a need to worry and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties who have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, whose origins are portable musical instruments and similar devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the level of noise of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns are growing as to hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to sound-like forms.
It is very possible to reduce these damage by looking for solutions as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee of the Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum noise permitted in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and can be estimated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno leaves the Commission open for the future of the capital
We start today, we close in March, we have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new headquarters in Caracall Spa.
In six months President Antonio Marzano and another 49 members of the Commission will draw up the manuals for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with a "official stamp" of Campidoglia and his councilmannio Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all the political, social and cultural ideas – he wants to emphasise Alemanno – he will need to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political decision-makers, who remain Giunta e General Council.
It is not an exchange of functions, but only an effort to have a place to process a great project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved, because this institution must have an exact time limit.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
Whoever accuses the Commission of unnecessaryness, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanna will reply: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as well as the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its benefits will be decisive.
Too often, politics will spread out on everyday problems and on the urgency that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "the Commission is not even a useless business or bluff: it is completely free, Roman citizens will not stand and the euro and serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic outline as a starting point, neither definite or unmovable, in order to allow our city to have an authentic rise at the level it needs and to think of it as a united spirit for its future."
The future, which specifies the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the current general border, but will look much further" not only in the path of the future metropolitan city and its legal statutes of the capital, but "it will also include the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, first anti-American president, we already know why.
One famous American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
The attacks against Obama are rising just as the date of the election approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama's got the nerve: he thinks he's going to get to the highest post of the nation, who had two governors and five black senators everywhere!"
In fact, these attacks don't say much; they're attacks of clearly racial origin and they don't answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have polls; everyone says Obama wins and has a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the U.S. South, wrote a comment: At least once in the polls, we know who the American patriot gives his voice to.
It's going to be a page of American mentality that's been stuck up until the last minute.
Say whatever you want, we'll take care of it ourselves, who to check out, whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been spoken yet, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
But in spite of all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush's main weapon.
They questioned 1,500 people: what mistakes Bush made during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied, Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent him home with the kicks in its ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were saved, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became for most of Bush's weakness.
Whoever comes to Georgia W's place will have to do a huge task.
Journalists felt the economic collapse of the United States: there is an investigation period in the newspapers, and many blame the internet, the "killer" press.
The PEW Research Center has questioned five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly say that they were less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem is for American journalists money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is the crisis of the destroyed economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in a room where editors work to put together newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to journalists, it is a problem that needs to be resolved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as the general public understands it.
The American journalist goes through a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press and executive seniors believe that a national journalism is the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against Broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The larger publishing industry is starting to take the path to the Internet, which many view as a "killer" press.
"Economy pressure", which journalists point to, has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists questioned admitted that they were resorting to technology in the hope that "the usual good thing" for their journalist.
The biggest gap in American journalism is among those who manage newsrooms – that means leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are certain that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value drops to 23%.
This has to do with "security work" for someone.
Leading people who think they'll lose a job within three years is 47% national.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're moving to 30%.
Regarding "a certain work" concerning staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still in daily order.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a huge nation as Usa, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and internet, employers often offer what they want, so the question is to take or leave.
Managers get almost always huge salaries and editors can make ten thousand dollars a month off salary and insurance.
As far as vacationers are concerned, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, are often ill within a year.
It's just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN ROME, DENMARK OF COMPONENT IN GROOTTAFERRATE
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of the entrepreneur with the real estate of Daniel Coppola, who asked him to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppol is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-offender sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During his own-cost trial, he received his release from his home prison last week, which was converted into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a businessman with real estate be able to change his place of residence from a rural town to a capital.
However, according to the court, this move (proposed by pm) would allow him to influence his company and to get to the evidence that he is accused of.
Elite in Danger
This phenomenon has been manifested several days ago, when the House of Representatives voted against the rescue plan for the $700 billion presented by the White House: a considerable number of Americans were more interested in and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is also confirmed by the New York Times yesterday, which inform us that the current crisis is rife with the Republican side, which is constantly more divided between its old East Coast soul, a gentler, friendly towards federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to those from Washington and towards the world of finance, which is particularly strong in the Middle and South states.
A soul that has been arrogantly expressed by the vote I was talking about at the beginning...
But this particular thing cited is just an example of change, a major change that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but in the entire West and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator for phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which in the new climate are being consolidated and are finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the recovery, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category of power in relation to a certain economic renaissance.
The crisis is indeed a crisis in the banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in a single country are primarily included in a single country.
Which simultaneously created a political problem for those who control it: it means how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are voters, among other things.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be essentially out of the game or has nothing to add: clear evidence has given the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different national strategies and which cannot be decided for one common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and mainly the distribution of funds: when we get to the pressure, only the states have the economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
It also has the necessary means and the right to use them: two sources of immense values, under certain circumstances, that no market and no international organisation will ever be able to hold a similar level.
This new phase, which the crisis places on the national state-of-the-art element, is, moreover, increasingly important in full compliance with the latest economic progress to be attributed to a single factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, the virtual, while we were convinced that the world's finances were already destined to rule the world, of nothing we realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little non-material things as water, grain, oil.
All the things that would have been said can be transported from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a restricted area, territory.
So, who will become their ruler, he certainly has a lot more cards in his hand than he is, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second novelty, but it's predicting a break.
Speaking of territory, state, government, inevitably talking about politics, i.e. leadership.
Given the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be emerging.
On the one hand, realizing that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, an application for someone who would be able to cope with the situation.
On the other hand, the wave of dyscretivity towards existing leadership, especially economic ones, which has proved to be equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together something deeper and in a sense disturbing: dyscredity, impatience, inability and absence, which is trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that there is a growing trend in the vast masses of the population to believe that their actions are the same as the ideas of the popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already overcome their time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership is short-lived by one branch, but a strong movement to remove ruling classes and traditional political arrangements is manifested in sudden electoral "refoulements" or in unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and most recent times, from conservative rise in Austria-Bavorland to the fall of Labourers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps to do so also to the victory of justice in Italy).
We believe that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, as well as their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have growing problems to understand, so to represent, which, not since today, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is intensifying, expanding, potentially too cumbersome.
Before that, it would be too much to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But I'm sure we can't say that it means keeping our eyes open.
Super glue to walk on walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to super-lepid and in the future walking on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centres and now the team of four institutions has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a hundred kilograms of body glued to the vertical wall with a sticker of only 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDIUM – The American magazine Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already in existence that use a specific structure of carbon called carbon dwarf tubes.
«The basis of glues can be seen as a series of tubes laid as an organized cluster of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the feet of a gecko, covered by microscopic hairs, which allow the animals to ensure a perfect casting.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time "will easily slip away from the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University Engineering Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a psychic glue" will add Liming Dai.
Maybe walking around like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of much less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are heat and electricity conductors.
Other applications could relate to aerial space engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH – University of Berkeley, California, is also engaged in research into new glue.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, California’s scientists presented microfibrous glue as hair, which is cleaned by dust by moving across the surface to keep the perfect fit.
Medicines: Never with juices
Watch out for grape, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving medicines, their consumption changes the strengthening or reduction of efficiency with serious health consequences.
In order for David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, to highlight the risks of juices both finished and fresh in combination with certain medicines, the current 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, is launching a new alarm: one glass of grape, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, to cancel their beneficial effects and to expose the health of patients to the risk.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to a toxic level the effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurologics.
ANNOUNCEMENTS IN RIZIK– The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in an information bulletin two years ago and recruited doctors and patients to avoid underestimating the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they are taking if they are taking medications, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NO GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contains substances that suppress medications.
Long list of effects suppressed by grapefruit and other juices.
Since then, the challenge of Michele Carruby, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"These discoveries are mostly immediately announced to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So do not worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification” highlighted an expert for Ansa.
Nobel laureate for the economy of Paul Krugman.
Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenyan who teaches at the University of Priceton and who is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of Bush administration's most important critics regarding foreign, economic and political steps.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, on the days of Enron's collapse, Krugman predicted in a New York Times comment that the second event would be, in terms of the consequences of the history of the United States, far more important than the first.
A prediction that caused no controversy and that had been miscalculated for years, however, proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked at what speed of collapse like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest, said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Binio Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is "an economy of great importance", but also a popularizer who has a very aggressive style, particularly critical against Bush's excesses of liberalist administration".
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of issue of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source package of personal production that is aimed at entering more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to a better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of voluntary workers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows up to the general public with different news: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved open window, add another, far more significant, as compatibility for Apple Mac OS X and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
The emphasis is also placed on working with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document with a new Microsoft file (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
The special features of some models are interesting, such as allowing you to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer the PDF folder to the graphic design model and to maintain the original appearance of the site.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrid" documents that resemble the typical graphics of the Adobe format and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within the application programmes: in addition it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts of change, in the text programme one color for comments is assigned to each co-worker in order to be clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on the transfer of some Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should switch the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which has been located on the peaceable since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for Linux operating system.
Also the installation cd can be sent home or on request to the workplace.
And if the subject of freeness can be a push to expand into households, it is on the business area of the Open Office package that is a lot of stakes, and it can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there is no lack of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a table processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphic model.
The aim for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand by today, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this estimated number can be overcome.
Kohl's results are also positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: this is Rakušan Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third-classed and winner of the top T-shirt.
The report quoted the L'Equipe diary.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive on Ceru, the Third Generation Epo, after Italy's Rickard Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the Kohl blood samples fall within those carried out in recent weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms the positive on Ceru, Rakusan will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the defined two years of disqualification.
The report on the positiveness of Kohl in the Third Generation Epo confirms the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced to the Associated Press that he has already informed the Austrian government of the outcome.
The 26-year-old Rakusan was placed on the levels of winners behind Spain by Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evansem, and he also won a pinched T-shirt of the best chef.
Immigrants: Didn't the York Times do the same thing, did they have rabies?
Italy's "like the countries of emigrants has only changed in the last house to the preferred target of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
Does this turn a beautiful country into a racist nation? So is this a long article in the New York Times, which debated this article on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, murdered last month in Milan, because he stole a box of cookies.
This case illustrates what the New York Times define as the "Paradox of the North": the northern areas are simultaneously those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigration thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italy and the immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by the Legou, which seeks to prevent immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of a changing climate in Italy.
The trend highlighted by both the pope and the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked that the state and the church work together to defeat racism".
Students with expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rent market for university students knows no crisis.
According to Sunia's latest research, tenant's unions, a single room can be rented by a student in Milan up to €900, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"He has already achieved such dimensions that all the classes of students have lost their right to study due to the generally too high prices that their families would have to endure – explains Sunia’s head office, Laura Mariani – in this city, a large demand by students has deformed the market in such a way that it has stimulated the process of price increases, which has also been applied to residents."
In most cases, rental offers contain several offences: contracts in a free manner, not registered, without a limited rent, related rents.
Sunji needs a special intervention that could regulate prices through the revision of taxes.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianz, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, for a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (the Bande Nere zone) over a medium value of 800 (the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zones) to a maximum of 900 (the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed is on average EUR 350/400, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in zones near the university, 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, ranging from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome, in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
The rates are a little lower (€550 per single) in zones near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
We save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room in the Prenestina, Centocele and so on.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are required for a bed, for a room of between 400 and 600 euros, with the highest prices in the polylinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari, they want at least 350 Euros for a single room, 250 350 Euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most common rent for students from countries outside the European Union, one other anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students compared to Italian.
Good-bye to the old cinema Paradiso, cities are disrupting historic halls.
Kinematographic historical halls close in favour of the Multiplex.
"A place without movies is like blind, like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centers as well as in rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, giving birth to large multisales in the suburbs and the subsequent destruction of monosals in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a genuine cultural crime.
It's like we've lost a friend, a friend we've shared a bit of a trip and a lot of emotions with," the director of the New Movie Paradiso, a film that, 20 years ago, won the Tornator Oscar and the grand jury in Cannes, and he told the poetry of one village cinema and sorrow over the way of life that probably lost the cinema forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years, the doors of 316 cinemas of the traditional tip closed, and the highest account paid mainly the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torín, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures, Emilia-Romagna is the first to lose 82 cinema rooms, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the evidence that the first responsible for their disappearance is the onset of a multiplex is the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multisales: 195 more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
«Italian procedure has developed irrationally» says Paolo Protti, President Anec, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about a lack of funding to the fund for operators: the previous government debt is about EUR 10 million.
From the moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between €16 million and €18 million per year would be required.”
An interesting case is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to be concerned with closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas, both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are steps of tax relief in favour of operators and benefits for the audience regarding mobility: the audience will be able to enter the restricted transport zone and will have special prices to stop and in some parking areas.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornere, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of biological introduction of other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to be able to resist the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and growing up, was a spark which convinced me to establish the "New Paradiso Cinema", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the closed Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I have shared so much emotion that I do not have to look at the inscriptions with black powder, I turn to the other side.”
The link between politics and the mob group 'ndrangeta, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal elections according to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli."
The charges brought against the mayor and vice-star Gioia Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarn Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are difficult.
In the irons also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and public administration, and his grandson a lawyer, the nominee of the chief, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay EUR 10 million.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," writes state officials, when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay for the advice of the lawyer Piromallim.
"This would enable the Mafia group – the judges – to officially join city offices – to facilitate the already huge possibilities of control and management of public administration."
The President of the Calabria Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised crime underworld are many in his province: "There are areas in which the concentration of mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangetes, heroes who are still spotless'.
The prisoners of this morning follow the imprisonment of July of last year to which the police showed that the mafia group Piromalli was finally hit.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, and the connection between organised crime and local administration was also foreseen at that time - local politicians have been deprived of their function in the general administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who was elected head of the right center coalition at the time of dissolution after the election in May.
He screamed about the scandal when Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He called for the responsibility of the then Deputy Minister of Interior Marc Minnih and accused him of having conceived everything for political reasons, but the judges in the detention regulation signed this morning explain that the mafia group even reached so far as to ask for a change in the A3 highway project.
Other interviews directed against Dal Torion, written by public prosecutors, revealed "the willingness to move the demands of the businessmen, representatives of some larger groups very close, as is generally known, to Piromallim and to adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the Mafia group."
When the energy comes from the waves, they get into the game by the big ones.
It is an infinite bearing that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now beginning to be discovered by large global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, are the new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the eye of the wheels, such as Chevron, now trying to reach out to these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away, but now the environmental organization and the new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 per cent of global electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea wave movements.
this quantity would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and tides and tides.
The giants are attacking.
Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in northern Portugal, was a company that had put on maritime energy.
When this purpose was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years, relying on marine energy, more and more companies rely on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology," said a spokesman for a company that is connected to the United States oil cycle, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal, thinking about opportunities to work with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns the obtaining of a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for launching a project on the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that it is in Alaska that oil continues to flow, and President Bush recently came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the sums invested so far, although not fully known, show increasing interest according to observers.
Technology, because it needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology, which is still in its first place, because it is not known what the impact of the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For the time being, devices in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not appear to cause major problems with the ecosystem.
For greater energy production, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are interconnected.
The power of waves that move with the barrels up and down is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these barrels.
The pressure is dilating the turbine, which supplies the energy to the generator.
Energy reaches the shores of submarine cables.
For the time being, at the project stage, there are four facilities of this type that are waiting only for federal approval and a portion of energy could serve military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping centre and parking by using six overseas turbines in New York’s East River.
The flow of water during the tide and tide causes the rotation of turbines, which by this rotating motion is a living generator.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of clients who are waiting for the necessary authorisation due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential of tides and tides, they say in the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although it is an unrelated factor, the tides and tides are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is to the energy of the influx and outflow of states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, and with other coastal states that they have already invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and have projected up to $35 million for 2009.
