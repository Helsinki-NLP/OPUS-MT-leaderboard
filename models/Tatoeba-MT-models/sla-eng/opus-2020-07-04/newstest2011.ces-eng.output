What's he doing?
The new Soviet capitals from the ČSSD will seem to have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the representativeship.
The daily News.cz members of the new council from the ČSSD "took out", as they know the notoriously established slang, which has been established on the town hall in recent years, when Prague ruled the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary that the Prague political cream introduced during the previous era of Prime Minister Pavel Bém describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the metropolitan area.
Surprisingly, the new councillors don't understand much of what they know.
At least it says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am more of a rookie in Prague politics," he responded to the test of a "Kmotrovsky" dictionary councilwoman for culture Lukaš Kaucký.
And as for the political veteran, so did Councilman Karel Brezin.
Maybe the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you present to me that I sometimes use."
"I don't generally recognize the other slang."
From a dictionary whose terms the journal Aktuálno.cz published this June before the ODS election congress, she chose six examples, mostly those that are notoriety-related to the Prague Magistrate.
Socialists were to explain the notions of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the candy store", "the bull's neck", "the betrayal of the capital" and "pave".
The three councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who will be in charge of education in Prague in the future - first the interview promised, but later he did not answer the phone.
Fifth Councilman Peter Dolínek immediately refused the test.
"I'm not dealing with these things at all, and I'm not going to value the way the civil Democrats play."
"I am now deciding how we will understand within our programmes," he reacted.
As has already been said, Councilman Lukaš Kauký would not appear in the title above to reveal that he is talking about an influential entrepreneur and a friend of Bém Roman Janouškou.
"Voldemort" tells Kauck nothing, and the only term he correctly estimated in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"That's the Blanca tunnel," he says, "and he immediately adds, "But I know it more from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for some language course," jokes.
The golf hole then, as Blanca tunnel, the management deciphers not only Matador Karel Brezina, but also the environmental councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukaš Plachem is also aware of where to find this figure - the meaning of the term "to go to the sugar shop" is unknown.
"That's what it means to go to some Prague business," is the shyness of clearing up that it's the headquarters of Janoušk's companies.
Compliant with Brezina, he reminds us that knowledge has been extracted from newspapers rather than from such a dictionary.
There is no similar dictionary of slang terms in social democracy according to the participants of the test.
"I was happy with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes using abbreviations and common names," says the president of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský, whose members call Huld.
"At school they called me Bryza, but I don't know if that's what colleagues call me," she admits to her own nickname Karel Brezin.
The journal News.cz has tried the name and works.
Radní Weinert is a party to Grandpa or a less friendly grandfather, representative of Miroslav Poche, who has warned against himself before the elections fraud during the sponsoring of the party, has a nickname for some colleagues called "The Games".
The aliases are also the only thing that social democrats in the interior talk accept.
The Huldu says Huldu is not happy to hear, but the daily Aktuno.cz also noted another title of this Prague president.
"Doctor of the Footwear Law" says Petr Hulínský won his title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of witches, has issued a brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso as witches have several common marks.
Rather, they belong to an older generation, unable to engage in work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation to not threaten the rest of the village.
"Man this fate will only last very rarely."
"Neither young healthy women are condemned because they help at work and give birth to children," describes a regular sister who, in the capital city of the West African state, Burkina Faso, is old enough to care for more than a hundred women in a special house who have benefited their community from their ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measures".
She published an information brochure that should help keep the hunt on the witch limited.
It's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," pointed out the disadvantage of writing journal Die Standard.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which was next to Burkina Faso, 20-year-old Amma Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, spilled oil and lit fire.
He informed the BBC server about the case.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence.
On the woman, according to their version, the oil used for ritual anointing was aroused.
He said the group started after she wanted to "exorcise the evil spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of witches supports people regardless of the level of education achieved.
Diary Der Standard quoted a 20-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "The devourers of human souls have always been dangerous," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government tried to calm down on witch hunts, the President himself took part in Gambia last year.
"The Gambian President Jammí, after his aunt's death, unleashed an extensive hunt on witches who were supposed to participate in her death and try to kill the president himself with the black magic."
"He called for help from the shamans of nearby Guinea, who, for the escort of police officers, soldiers and personal protections of the President, were violently escorting randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in her report.
People on the farm had to drink leukemia from herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Bakal's tenant: Melt in stones, higher rent signed
The older undergraduate man stepped out of the door of the client center of the company RPG Flats "uhlobarona" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arms he carried the file and in it a new lease contract for three apartments: his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the penalty.
All three have just raised the rent deregulation.
Instead, 3500 a month from next year, the son will pay for 2+1 second category 4100 crowns.
"And that is not warm water and must be melted (a stone on solid fuel, no. red)," the man shows with his son's finger a new contract, whose signature is full of power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half resigned.
The Citizens' Association BytyOKD.cz, which branded the new lease terms as "uncorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December when they publish instructions on how to deal with them.
But the man's just waving his hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," he blinks.
Ostrava becomes a large deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year there is a large majority of apartments that still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic.
At the moment, why did she choose to visit the "laborator" in person?
The RPG's Havířovska waiting room is one of four in Ostrava, and on Tuesday at nine in the morning it's already full.
There's a security guard outside the door and a caller.
"Our 2011", lights a special button on his touch screen.
One knock and a paper number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read or read "157" and your cifra is already beeping on a large screen below the waiting room ceiling.
You're next in half a second.
After a while, the elderly couple come to ask for their rent, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to involve new rents at all.
Most people have come to deal with common problems like other times - requests for repairs, insurance events and the like.
Letters with new leases are sent to Ostrava by tenants of a total of 44,000 RPGs from around mid-November.
In letters RPG flats propose to them an increase of 15 to 38 percent.
A special desk for new rentals was opened at the client center on 18 November.
"It's running for over a week, so it's only on the run," the workers behind the counter after a moment of weighting when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections he was rather loudly taken by Parliamentary Vice-President and Ostrava's native Lubomír Zahorálek of the ČSSD, and even now he is full of local newspapers.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"Neither did they change my toilet board," the man mentioned said in the introduction.
Most of the time, according to the workers, pensioners come to see if they get a discount on rent if they sign on time as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half the discount on the February rental will also be paid to other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
The Havířov "deregulatory" bulkhead but the questions are definitely not absorbed.
"Of the 360 clients yesterday, there were only about 40 or 50 people here for the 2011 rental," estimated the workers behind the bulkhead.
In doing so, RPG on the website and its walls proposes individual negotiation of contracts where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, an independent court will have to determine it.
"It is not about threats, but about information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG points out on its website.
"There won't be any judgment here," he thinks one of RPG's flats and a man on the street outside the client center gives her some of the truth.
"I have 13,000 pensions and I have five thousand left to eat, I don't have to judge," he says.
Well, the staff will just be unsettled at the time.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait," he thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in the majority of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to the RPG, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rental still does not reach even above necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimesz, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Flats, that it is precisely the tenant's fault with the neglect of the housing fund that, according to homeowners, is the main reason for the increase in rents.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs were able to invest four billion in housing, in four years from 2011 to 2014, it would be 5.2 billion.
A large-scale screen hanging from the ceiling across from the semi-structured seats of the Weiwire Standstill repeats several red highlighted information so far.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less relates to 31,200 flats, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most 7.50 CZK per meter square and a month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 RPG apartments will receive 38 per cent of the rent.
"In these cases, it is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19,66 per square metre," the RPG points out.
For 2,600 apartments, next year's rent will remain the same.
RPG The apartment promises that deregulation will not run out of rents in jump, but will be distributed within four to eight years.
In addition, he adds another commitment: all the money from the increase of rent (see graph) will put the company back into apartments, mainly into heat saving - new windows and heating.
Preferably, they have to be given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The office includes a kindergarten, understood by the architects
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide a mini-school with everything that's involved - with colored walls, imaginable furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, children of Arch.Design staff can visit it.
Projection-architectonic company Arch.Design, of which a number of major Brno buildings have been built, has been counting the space for its corporate mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of babyboom and cared for women designers and architects to get back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of reduced relationships, the kindergarten benefits Arch.Design offers its employees within the framework of the social programme.
Construction workers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding work with caring for a child.
The students themselves invented Arch.Design and managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs with the support of their leadership.
The business school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme and the Czech State budget.
Thanks to grant funding (a grant of CZK 2,8 million) it was possible to purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operation for two years.
After exhaustion of the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design has the obligation to operate a mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year and with the request for a subsidy was significantly assisted by Economy Rating.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the care of children is provided on a full-time basis by the nurse and the teacher of the MŠ, so children can go to school without age limits, although most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it's a minicycle, there can only be five children at the same time, but more can be done during the day.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme supplement in the minority school is comparable to the pre-school curriculum.
Not only do children play here, but they are provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation to school benches, English is also taught.
Class is equipped not only with toys, trigger games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their children at any time and lose stress with the delayed removal of children from kindergartens away from their parents ’ workplace.
In this way, parents make more productive use of working time.
No wonder there is a naturally loyal relationship between an employee and an employer.
Arch.Design has thus joined Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program has strengthened personal marketing.
The house of the bones is fascinating after 100 years. Look into the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a right-wing lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
He earned a nickname for the House of Bone thanks to his organic forms.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facades that resemble raccoons and everywhere soft curves, all of this is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The head of the house plays dream lines, delicate colors and textures that resemble nature and animals.
A detailed observation shows geometry, rhythm and precise order.
The whole facade of the house sounds even more dramatic at night, it is illuminated so that the impression of the light color is still strengthened.
Vulgates and twists shapes with the same measure appear in interiors.
The wood in the waves is copied by window frames, rails, ornamental elements of doors, hooks and strips.
The house of Batlló, which stands in Eixample District on Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was rebuilt by architect Emilio Sala Cortese in 1877.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on disrupting the old building and building completely new, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló's business house, but Antoni Gaudí did not design it himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
It is on his design board that decoration was created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaic on the facade.
A number of other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the suggestions of Casa Batlló's house started with the successful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá and Güell Park, where there are other Gaudí works.
From the locals, he earned a nickname for "House of Bone" thanks to his organic forms.
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it the "breathing house".
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the Patron of Catalan, is depicted at the top of the building.
The hidden religious motives include other sculpture elements of the building.
Gaudí offered a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys for his time.
Bizarre might seem like their forty-five degree slope.
When constructing Gaudí, he totally disregarded the building regulations of those days and did not let them be bound.
At the beginning of the construction, however, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the figures on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when the completion was completed, the city council was threatened with the result and requested repair.
For example, the council objected to the fact that the construction involved the pillars in the public sidewalk.
The repair never happened, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the city's call, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two top floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a lounge and on the third floor the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry.
The entire six-story house cuts through the stairwell, which can be climbed to the roof terrace itself.
The basic elements of the reconstruction were the removal of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the lounge doors and a larger company can communicate comfortably without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí’s reconstruction also received an unconventional concussion and an extra two floors.
It is also impressive to play Gaudí with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which is covered with inner yard, and lamps.
The game of two colors adds maximum light to all floors of the house.
Simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs sunlight.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and hospitable apartment available to the public.
The owners decided on this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftyth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
In the course of the surveys, they found that it was a very advantageous business and also extended the tours to common and sub-crime areas, including roof terraces.
Admissions to the monument are certainly not negligible, amounting to 16,50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist certificates have a 20 % discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the entry price to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you must quickly make friends with one of the inhabitants of the boar and visit it directly at home.
How to pick mattresses and grow: Women have different requirements than men
Never a proud frame of beds, but the quality of the beds, i.e. mattresses and grow, give the base a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously supplemented to suit a particular user.
When choosing, many choices are made, ranging from weight, height, age, health status, and gender of the owner.
It is also important to have the type of interior to which mattresses and sprouts are taken.
A typical example?
For example, weekend cottages, where they do not flood regularly, are not suitable latex mattresses because they are slowly "heating".
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to rotate them regularly.
If they don't have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they're still lying on a solid panel, they're holding moisture: they could also have mold under them.
When choosing, it is also the custom to choose.
Those who have spent longer periods abroad, where they often use very high mattresses with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel good on the low and hard surface.
"Unfortunately, all the hockey players who came back from the NHL were complaining to me that he wasn't going to sleep here."
"On their swollen shoulders, heel and hips, they needed mattresses that softened the layers of lazily foam."
"These are recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they take misinformation from their joints and skins," explains Sylva Hadamchik, who specializes in cell furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, therefore, years ago she sought a linen foam mattress.
"Today it's fine, proper mattresses have a Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
Optimizes its stiffness and shape by absorbing heat, or adjusts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you won't turn over like a hard fight at night.
You're just gonna get a better night's sleep.
Ling foam also works as a protection against lying.
When selecting the size of the mattress add the length of the foot to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in a double bed, which is 180 cm in total.
For single beds, e.g. for singles, it is recommended to have at least 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"On the other hand, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back you should have your hands comfortably slightly swollen in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the Cech Chamber of Pilgrims and Decorators, who has devoted many years to healthful sleep and ergonomy of furniture and has lectured it at professional schools.
For a double needs each of its own mattresses, but here watch your shopping to sweeten the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing more than putting the bars into various heights, but you may not succeed in every frame of bed.
The foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, of the spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres count on the moulding and cyping layer.
"You mustn't feel springs by touching your hand or sitting on a mattress," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of powder.
Full-bodied beds, where mattresses and backgrounds are like mature Siamese twins, do not have anything to do in beds.
The mattresses have a bad breeze, they can't wash off their sweats, which is already common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat overnight, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble one large (and clogged) net.
Therefore, experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses for up to 25 years, or even life guarantees.
But everything has its own buttocks.
Therefore, the advice from salesmen: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, do not give up the removable coating, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and clean.
Although today the mating patterns are usually produced with a jumble across the circuit, so after the opening we get two parts (for washing and washing size very important!), still the manipulation of larger types (and at one person) in filming could remind the fight of light weights in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a hard plate in your bed instead of a dirtbag?
Never!
Maximum on the bed intended for one night's visits.
However, the board is still equipped (if it is no longer) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in sachets (from it.Taschenfenderkern) and a spray layer.
Polyurethane mattresses don't belong on that basis.
On non-position lamellas with 14 to 18 lamelas will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut), but you will always be paid with a larger number of lamelas, 28 or more, where lamellas in the area are double and can be regulated by their density.
The positioning straps do not belong to spring skeleton mattresses because they do not respond to the positioning.
In addition to the firmness settings, the lamella can also be fitted with the so-called shoulder cradle.
It's a special lamela grip that allows you to push, or even bend the lamela in such a way that the shoulder is broken.
For men who have "frames across their backs", definitely an important thing.
Even it is remembered by the mattress manufacturers who started to use the soft zone in "pans" in the area of the shoulders.
Women are also remembered - they are again accompanied by soft surfaces in the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate bars with so-called multi-storey dusting.
The pressure is distributed to multiple points and the voltage is reduced.
However, be careful when you use the right mattress and grow the wrong pillow (big and "stupid"), most of the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head with the tip of the arm only to release the shoulder muscles.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, for example, preferred in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the cushion should be aligned (with the shoulder cradle or soft zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with original strawberries filled with grass.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least impurities.
The trend is simply bio mattresses.
The crude oil from which polyurethane foam is produced is replaced by natural oils, such as jumping and soybean.
Soya is probably being used by all the known manufacturers.
"Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Dášíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress straps, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also wish for microcapsals to relieve you of the fresh scent of wood or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While a man "cools" a plant extract from the belly to absorb heat and cool the body, the women on the other side of the hood "sinks".
The extract from red peppers increases blood circulation, so it is the weaker sex of warmth.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (with bigger pores with broken cell structure, it is more breathtaking than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
By combining the various stiffness of the cold foam and lazily foam, multizone mattresses are formed that know exactly where the head, thigh and heel are to be.
You will pay from seven thousand crowns and above for your quality mattress.
Those that meet health parameters have a lower VAT rate are taken as health aids.
He was the first to achieve this advantage of Gumotex in the Czech Republic.
Saving on mattresses and dust isn't easy.
Sometimes it is possible to use the actions of producers or sellers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreez mattress with all the memory foam of the Memory in the hood for 11 990 crowns.
The other, however, can be arranged free of charge.
Eru lazy or viscoelastic foam with open cell structure and high density started with the "space" pace material Tempur.
It originated as NASA's material because at the starters astronauts were exposed to an enormous overload.
On the contrary, the temperature softens in warmer weather.
The warm human body adapts so perfectly and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of lesions, but also for improving sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only on mattresses but also on medical products, such as special pillows under the legs, which make the legs and the venous system relieved.
The local producers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
They want more and more parents to watch their children.
Fear of your own child leads more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
A system originally designed to search cars can also monitor people’s movements, thus helping in such cases as the disappearance of nine - year - old Anika Janatková.
The device is as big as a box of cheese so far, but soon it can only be as big as watch.
A number of people were frightened by the missing Anika case and began to sift through the means to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of disrupting their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that there is no spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood that a tragedy will happen," says Peter Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases such devices may be misused, such as when they are placed in a bag to someone who does not know, but we have not yet met such a case."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like that, he'll just get rid of it.
"And very young children show great creativity in how to lose some things on purpose if they don't want to be controlled."
"Great expectations were raised earlier with the parents of the mobile, which can however be turned off as well as this monitoring device," Bočková said.
According to her, it is also questionable whether such a device would really help in the event of an attack.
"If it's a prepared kidnapping, make sure the perpetrator practically always has no electronics with him that could reveal his position."
"Now it's a phone."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will be looking for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
However, it admits that similar devices can help in the event of an imminent attack by pedophiles.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and individuals, even if the attack occurs after the immediate destruction of the tracking device, his presence may help.
"The device may be adjusted to regular transmission of the position after a certain period of time has elapsed."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The more expensive equipment is built also on the slopes, so even if a person just slips down and remains motionless, the device will immediately send out a warning device with an indication of the position," said Bohemia.
According to him, a similar service can also be carried out by smart mobile phones with navigation, where you can record a special software.
The problem with the current monitoring units is that they are either devices similar to the size of the box or smaller mobile phones.
They're always in danger of losing them.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, this is why it is now testing a device that looks like a normal digital watch.
"This will have the greatest advantage in the fact that a possible aggressor does not need to know the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll know them after a while and it can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices are turned into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology that is used to guard cars.
It is a combination of GPS-based location detection (which uses common auto navigation) and mobile phone functions, which state the current position of the vehicle.
The army has inflammatory cords that would confuse the Czech Republic, but it will last only two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of cords that set off the ripples.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence added a line to the warehouses 244 kilometers [24 km].
The army has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the string is two, at most four years.
The army bought fuel cords from the STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff in order to justify the purchase of such a huge amount of MF DNES igniting cords wrote that soldiers use 60 kilometres of lighters per year during training.
From the calculations of the military pyrotechnics that MF DNES has addressed, however, it follows that then they would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year even all generals, officers of command of the army, secretaries or cleaners.
Minister of Defense Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlasimila Picc does not rule out.
That's the only way to justify the annual consumption of the army's 40 miles [60 km] of inflammation.
That length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's supplies would be sufficient for more than ten years.
On the contrary, if the basic training of each new professional is sufficient to cover at least two metres of inflammatory cords, as experts say, so did the army with fresh purchase - even with increased consumption of women's or special units - supplies for the above-mentioned 225 years.
The troops of the rapid deployment brigade have recently complained personally to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for handguns, so the shootings due to the need for money are also limited.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"Neither does my head accept that they buy so many lighters from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and they certainly know what they're going to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer, whom we as businessmen are trying to meet," says STV Group manager Jan Děcký.
The Ministry of Defence speaks, Jan Pishenko, justifyes hundreds of kilometres of purchased cords even by the military having supplies of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group is only talking about four years of life of the lighter and police or military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"In perfect storage, it may be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier for criticizing the army, does not want to publish a name.
After a lifetime, each ammo must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not threaten the soldiers of life.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument by the Ministry is the quantitative discount on 445 kilometers of ignite cords.
"We were costing 60 per cent less than last year's supply two hundred and forty kilometres," the interpreter Poznek spokeswoman of the Ministry of Defence's purchasing opinion.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of the firing cords of police pyrotechnics, which dispose of ammunition from World War II or from the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always order only so much to use this ammo before the lifetime passes.
It has been proven because of the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also gain more flexibility, and thus more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence is already in considerable difficulty with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty era, when the two hundred thousand-thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing for the Rýn campaign.
The Czech according to the pyrotechnics that MF DNES has addressed is waiting for the same problem in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of miles of old lighters that it buys today.
So far, I'm drawing on the contacts I've gained from the competition.
Winning place in the competition The Championship of the Year helped Lukaša Pytlón to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's annual competition was the 80-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun enjoyed traveling.
And abroad, he realized that there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberec.
With savings from foreign brigades and a bank loan, he bought a half-broken house with five apartments.
For being a third-year student of high school then, that was a great courage.
"The current ratio between quality and the price of accommodation in our house did not give me anything to try to do," says Lukás Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to rent to foreign workers.
All profits were invested back into the house, which gradually converted to a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, within seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses in Liberec, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was just now the 4-star Pytloun design hotel.
But this year another, same quality, came to him.
"We actually have a signed contract with the hotel in Ostrava at Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels, says last year's researcher number one.
"And on this sale the hotel's license to operate was very much involved in the winning of the Year's Champion," Pytlow adds.
The victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me additionally, and I must say that it was pleasant," he recalls.
Participating in the competition strongly encourages those who try to do something.
There's no need to win, every vision is good.
He says he's still drawing on contacts and acquaintances he might not have gotten to today.
"Some of the people I met with because of the competition, I started trading regularly."
The fame associated with his success seemed to have affected every employee in the world.
And he's got about 70s.
"I observe with them greater loyalty and pride in participating in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of good work for all of us together."
"Only my name is pushed into the foreground," Luke Pytloun said humbly today.
I wish my successor a more peaceful year than we had at the Farm.
The euphoria of victory quickly reversed the effects of the crisis.
Due to the goallessness of the winner, however, the Farm has worse times over.
For the first place in last year's Vodafone Company competition last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, arrived in Slovenia last year.
The jury then appreciated the efforts it had made from a small tool workshop in the Czech Skalici company with a hundred million turnover.
"I can say that appreciation has encouraged not only me, but all my colleagues and increased our confidence in the fight against competition," the winner said last year.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karl Žďársky's father to rent a small workshop as compensation for Communists seized property, he hesitated for a long time, refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his dad founded a company on plastic tubs.
Soon thereafter, they began specializing in plant oil foxes.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic foxes in Central Europe.
Greater awareness of the company's lack of public opinion has been achieved since its success in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers begin to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in its country," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, it was not just a sign of euphoria from victory in Farmet.
The valuation was based on the company’s economic performance by 2008 and only partially by 2009.
And it was just 2009 that was the toughest year for selling hardware.
It culminated in a crisis that hasn't touched so many citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and started to restrict the purchase of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, has not escaped us either."
"We had to cut production by 40 percent and we had to release it," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes be able to take such unpopular measures.
But they did manage the situation and kept the company in profit even though it was less than before the crisis.
However, what they did not reduce at the Farm is investment in research and development.
"With the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened the presentation at international fairs, gained the main award in home exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
Markets are growing again and there are also new employees with them.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel Žďárský told.
A survey that removes preposterous regulations
The survey on the Absurdity of the Year is a fourth part of the business ring.
Some preposterous regulations have already been repealed.
Infamous winners of the next year's Absurdita poll became the duty to carry documents to the Office, which are also available online to officials.
It has decided more than a third of a quarter of a thousand voters.
For example, the social security management required a paper copy from a business register, even if the official could get it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the poll, it's gonna change.
"The Czech social security management will no longer require a statement from the business register in the checks on the insurance payers," said ČSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
To highlight all the regulations and regulations that businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must implement, and they make sense of canceling them in the sense of the absurdity of the year.
This is already the fourth part of the business call organized by the Economic Journals this year, and the public enjoys growing popularity.
If there were about three thousand voters in the vote last year, this year there were almost 4,000.
And there is no wonder, the various legal obligations that serve only to keep business, are still enough and enough.
"For example, in the number of tax returns, we are in the leading places in the world," says Karel Havelíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Professionals of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business in recent years has become the hallucinatory goal of all governments.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving compared to the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic was ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The absurdity contest of the year was first announced in 2006 and takes place each year according to the same scenario.
An administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can be reported annually from April to the end of September, when the contest is concluded.
The website address www.firmaroku.cz The organiser then selects seven candidates for "anticinene" and lets the public vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.hined.cz during October.
Absurdity, which gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, more than 105 regulations and regulations lacking meanings have been applied to this year's poll.
The tips were sent by businessmen, as well as professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalist" competition, for example, among the nominated ones, the requirement for road and road maintenance vehicles to pay for tolls, or for businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
The list of proposals this year is published on the competition website.
The competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Václav Square in Prague, is part of hapenning, which regularly participates in political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Trade Manufacturers of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, assisted the competition.
"The economic prosperity cannot function where the state throws hammers at entrepreneurs under their feet, which is why my aim is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs each year that make business unnecessary today," said the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break a pointless regulation doesn't sound empty.
In 2007, the obligation of businessmen to report three days in advance to the Trade Office in the place where a permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with a stand for an exhibition or a pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by a new trade law.
The second most voted obligation in 2007 which was announced by the Office of Labour for its foreign staff for a service journey of up to 30 days was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And a third of everything good.
In 2009, the regulation of physiotherapists became absurd to have a large mirror, refrigerator, and two patch weights in the office.
This year, the Ministry of Health's decree was relaxed - the obligation to have a refrigerator fell.
New categories appreciate socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects shall be considered.
This year's fifth year of competition for Economic Newspapers is a category called Responsible Company in 2010.
The promotion of a reasonable and fair business is a means of sending this competition.
"We want to support companies in this way that take into account the environmental impact of their business and promote socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, Regional Mobile Operator Manager, Vodafone, who is the advertiser and guarantor of the competition, as well as in the case of the rebel year competition.
By this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company in 2010, companies have signed up for which there is no success in business with the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published on a separate article.
Although one of the other is diametrically different from the other, the common denominators of their efforts can be considered to be support and consideration.
In one case, for example, it concerns affected people and, elsewhere, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 nationwide finalists, the Prague software company Et Netera, for example, has found herself supporting the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the responsible company in Pardubice is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the grant fund of hendicized children for 17 years.
His disabled employee was again an old paper from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of them, and therefore won the title of the Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region, and Vodafone Company was placed in the region as a third.
In Olomouck, MiRiz Soft, an accounting firm, who has introduced flexible working hours, won an additional loss of average 35 hours a week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for purchasing mainly from Czech producers, supporting civil activities in the surrounding area and protecting the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the slightest impact on the environment," explains acting director Milusz Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústecké Region again thinks about the health of its employees and has provided ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local protected workshop.
"In addition to this, we support the foundation of Man in Pressure, which helps specifically the local Roma community," says the representative of Ondřej Suchy.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of the company Praní and the cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which, in the form of overtime bonuses, contributes to their pensions.
"With us again we give contributions to food, transport, improving qualification and recreation," says Josef Strapáč of the British construction firm of the Times, a winner of the Moravian Silesian Region.
All the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company competition were automatically registered in the category Responsible Company of the year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to 15 August organizers no later than.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then removed from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the contestants did not answer the questions, the company responsible could not participate in the competitions of the year, but were not disqualified from the Vodafone Company's main competition."
"It is not possible to enter this competition alone because it is a subcategory of the company's main competition," explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose's agency.
In the Pilsen Land Fund, police arrested during the competition
In the Pilsen Land Fund building, anti-corruption police have been arrested in the last days.
The iron detectives planted with local entrepreneurs in the media sphere and a merchant with the real estate of Luboši G.
He reportedly attempted to manipulate the ongoing public competition to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would receive a specific bidder.
He was supposed to pay half a million crowns for it.
"I can only confirm that the police are suing one person for perverting the knitting in the public contract and in the competition," said Law Chief of the Plzeň State Attorney Antonie Zelená, with the fact that further details cannot be provided in view of the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, a six - year - old businessman was released.
The way in which the public competition could affect can only be speculated, given the minimum official information.
The spokesman for the Lubómír Černá Land Fund said that police officers were actually arrested at a separate workplace in Pilsen during the public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she explained.
The public competition has the right title, according to Montenegro, "Requirement for applying for land transfer under the Land Law" and is held where more authorized applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These persons, in the context of the call, offer higher value of their restitution entitlements, which are to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the proposed claims, the order of the purchasers shall be determined and the Land Fund shall then transfer the land to the person who has offered the highest claims," explained the fund speaker.
Luboš G. apparently had information on who submitted to the call, and since he himself is also a legitimate person, because he has acquired a number of restitution claims, offered the applicant the land that he would not participate in the competition.
He must have charged off-limits for that.
That would explain that he had such a large amount of money in custody.
Luboš G. had superior contacts with PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was acting in the causation of former Chief of the PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing land in a replacement restaurant on which a decision on the location of the building had already been made.
At that time, Luboš G. received from the Fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the arrival highway was to be built into the industrial zone of Borská pole.
Later, he changed them very favourably with a magistrate for a house in the very historical center of the city, which had a much higher value.
That's when the town hall had to go, because otherwise, by blocking land, it would endanger the building.
Housing households pay hundreds a month
From January onwards, households will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and shipyards, heat supplies, and somewhere they will grow rents.
So families will have to pull hundreds of crowns monthly from their wallets from January.
Electricity will lose up to 4.6 per cent, gas will be about 2 per cent more expensive, when you have to pay a tenth in some cities for water supplies and many times less heat supplies.
The loss of electricity should be done annually by households with hundreds of shocks rather than now.
The prices of power, while reducing all major suppliers, are therefore markedly increasing in support of renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics.
Although the gas will be released slightly, however, at a time when people melt most and have the highest consumption.
It must therefore also count annually with hundreds of extra crowns.
While electricity and gas are pumped all over the Republic, the change in central heating prices varies place from place to place.
Price increases are planned mainly by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové have been paying about 50 crowns a month for central heating since January, with more than 1,000 crowns paid annually to families in Liberec.
People in Prague are at risk of losing more than 9 percent of their water and shipyards if the city increases the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Prázná 6.8 percent will be paid.
The price in Prague, however, will still belong in the overall national comparison between the lower ones.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, the water and sewage prices are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, the rental price in 450 thousand rental apartments can rise sharply, with the end of the regulation since January.
For example, the CPI Company, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase up to a hundred percent of its rent from January.
Those who do not agree to the new rent are willing to bring society to justice.
The regulated rents paid by people in about 300,000 apartments could increase by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is made of fashion, works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally and better whisky brand stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often end in the care of doctors who have not yet been drunk for 15 years.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly from ape in the hospital.
This is due to the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the children’s ward.
"Some beer or wine is totally fashionable, because it takes long before you get drunk."
"The trend is certainly hard alcohol," told the Law Prime Minister of the Children's Department of Hořovice Hospital in the Central Bohemias Luděk Pelikaán.
"If they manage to get a bottle of Daddy out of the closet, it's all about whiskey, otherwise he's controlling the fernet and the vodka."
"The water has the advantage of being poured into juice and not feeling so much," the prime minister explained.
And he's telling him the truth, the Speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurin.
"It's mostly fernet or rum."
"That's modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slide they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to Prime Minister Pelican, 13 or 14 - year - old drunks are quite common on hospital income.
Before Horovice, where he has been operating since this year, he has worked for ten years on the pediatrician in Motola, where ambulances bring down the high schoolers from a wide area.
"One girl was with us about four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with 3.5 miles of extra alcohol in her blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor said in particular a particularly serious case.
"She was at a show in Holesovice for some dance parties."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the prime minister marveled.
The failure of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring is considered to be the main cause of growing child drunkenness.
However, according to experts, there is no need to talk about addiction in the right word.
"According to the concept of an alcoholic, it is a multi-year chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomena that belong to it, and that is not the case with children."
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is more to say the unspeakable family-social background," explained Prime Minister Pelican.
According to spokesman Jurin, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized at a pediatric clinic in Motola this year until mid-November.
However, only those with severe inxia who have to stay in the hospital will get to the statistics.
Children's drunks who take their parents after an outpatient treatment, or they're taken home by the police, don't count.
Except in cases where children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of carrots, there are three seasonings according to Pelican that can be relied on: witches, Silver and the end of the school year.
"That's either a miscarriage or they're celebrating the beginning of the holidays."
"But at the witch's side, I experienced the income of seven children's drunks at once," said Pelican.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at the expense of someone who suffers from an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
The morning headache caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will trigger an induction infusion with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're actually better at it because they have a beautiful evening experience and a good awakening and nothing hurts."
"They're just confused about where they are," he admitted Pelican by sometimes spoiling patients' pleasant mood by at least counting the costs that their treatment required.
The transportation of ambulances and hospitalizations on an acute bed will also result in tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as a means of education, when I went directly to those children on a visionary basis, how much their drunkenness cost, and that they could also spend the whole summer at the brigade to make money for this one party," Pelican added.
However, health insurance companies, according to him, are not involved in regressive procedures in which the cost of treatment would be incurred by parents in the case of children's drunkards.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft from the total of five pieces for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft on Tuesday flew to Spanish Seville, where the seat of the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft.
It is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
They've only been on practice or show years so far.
It is a two-digit version of L-159T1, which has still been operated by the Czech army and which have been airsighted.
The remaining three machines are L-159.
So far, you are standing reserved in Aera Vodhodes and trade broker - Omnipol - has already taken over last week.
When airplanes physically leave Vodhode, according to Jan Pejšek, it is not yet known from the defense press department.
"L-159 fixed-wing aircraft have been decommissioned from long-term fixed-wing aircraft without further deposits and investments by the Ministry's Department."
"Double L-159T1 has been changed in the current state and form," said Pravá Przysznik.
He added that the army without two-seat aircraft would not remain because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a contract with Aera Vodhodey worth 200 million crowns to rebuild four non-necessary L-159 machines for two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft took over an army in July, the other takes over until the end of this year.
According to Pejsk, the EADS has committed itself to deploying aircraft into the armament of some Alliance country.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft operator is EADS and will serve the training of NATO pilots."
"There is therefore a matter for the customer how this thing will be carried out," Pashek said.
Economic news reports earlier said that for example, the Spanish army of L-159 is not interested.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of another three aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirka Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not write down a tender and addressed directly the EADS.
The current defence leadership argued that it would support future exports of L-159 abroad by replacing them.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aera and only used 24, the rest would want to sell.
The sale of Casa's planes is likely to have a court date.
The European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence, appealed to the European Court of Justice because it had to select aircraft on the basis of a European tender and not the address of one producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one to fly to Kbely Airport in Prague within 14 days.
Longer Pointer than Ring signifies a lower cancer risk
Men who have longer pointers than a ring are at less risk of having prostate cancer.
That is the surprising conclusion of a study published by the British Cancer Journal on Wednesday.
It could be associated with testosterone male hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under the age of 60," said co-author Ros Eelesová, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer tests, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed over 1,500 prostate cancer patients and over 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the students in the study had an index finger on their right hand shorter than a ring.
She paid them the same chance of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
However, in the case of those who had the pointer longer than the ring, 33 percent of the risk fell, even 87 percent for men in the 60 ’ s.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the uterus.
Less than testosterone corresponds to a longer pointer.
Earlier studies have shown that testosterone is in favour of growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, for the Czech Republic, said that he was familiar with this study, but he was not told that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer would be "fully proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
Roads and corridors are mostly snow - stricken, road users riding all night in many places.
The D5 motorway between 89 and 93 km in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents in freight and passenger cars and is also standing at D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was told to the news by UAMK, dispatcher of the Central Motorway.
On the 21st mile [91 km], a truck crashed, and two trucks crashed, causing injuries.
Several personal cars were also killed in the trench.
The problems are also on D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
There were two stones crashing down there.
Drivers should be on their way to Brno on the 190th mile (190 km) or driving through Brno and then riding the 182nd mile [182 km] on Kyvalce.
It's a multi-kilometre colony.
There's also an accident on D11 highway, right on the way to Prague.
In Prague there is a multicentimetre layer of snow, thermometers show a minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car convoys are formed on Prosek, and Štěrboholská is crammed.
The most reliable means of transport is metro.
Tramways are delayed by, for example, the route between Karlovy Square and the City of Peace.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Headquarters is scheduled to meet again.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech tracks have already had to cancel seven quick circuits due to the snow.
Problems have, for example, a route from Prague to Kralupe or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
The airport of Ruzyna was closed from the mid-11 hours at night until five in the morning.
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are already downhill, but only with increased caution.
In Vyškovsk there are three side roads, in Brno places are made up of snow tongues and in Blanensk some communications are needed in the above-stamped areas of the snow chain.
The most affected places included Vyškovsko.
There are still closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Charatice - Milesovice.
They're going to have to put the mills in.
When they're passing through, it's not supposed to be.
Caution is needed in the area of White Carpathians in Hodonín.
On the roads that are only inert in nature, up to a five - inch [5 cm] layer of snow, the Czech Republic stated.
In the Czech Republic it occurred from two to ten centimeters of snow, most in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian part of the region, about two inches [15 cm] of snow occurred.
The snowing in the Czech Republic is stagnating.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American Army has put on a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, yet known only under code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is like a little super-precious gun.
Her designs indicate a laser with accuracy of several meters.
The 25 mm special shells developed for this rifle and containing a high explosive tear gas are actually working as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only at impact to the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind some obstacle, wall or trench.
Because Shora is usually not protected, and when the murderous rain of steel strata falls on it, it can remove it from the battle.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry using "smart" technology.
"A soldier with her basically deals with her by finding a target, sending a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gets a precise point, he adjusts the intention and pulls the tap."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun will be loaded and fired at a distance of 543 meters plus a minus one, two or three meters," said Audette.
400 jobs moving
The Fujitsu concert is moving its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their job to Astro Park in July next year from the present administrative building to Marienbader Township in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the gigant reported on Wednesday in the field, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, will move in July of next year 400 men and women from the present administrative building at the Marienbader Township in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the comments made by Fujest, another 100 jobs of the company, which are currently divided in the region, should be moved there at an early date.
The rental offer was said to have been very attractive and large-scale offices in Astro Park are more suited to the working method of employees.
Also, Fujitsu was rent-only in Bad Homburg.
The competent executive, Bernd Wagner, said, "in Frankfurt-Nederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure".
An excellent connection with the airport is very important for a global society such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important business within the region sparked the joy of the winners and the disappointment of the losers yesterday.
The head of the economic referee in Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this succeeded in obtaining a "global player".
It's called a fantastic demonstration of trust in this place.
Fujitsu is said to be suited to the city, accommodation is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korvisi (Green), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was reportedly informed in due time by the management of the company of his intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," said Corvis.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the real estate tenant at Marienbader Square.
The result was decisive economic reasons.
It is now a matter of preventing the long non-inclusion in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The house on the Rathaus-town, which had been using Fujitsu so far, and the neighboring Klein Vertikale, belonged ten years ago along with the other buildings at Marienbader-town, to the most discussable building intentions of the spa city.
The station and the council were formed as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called city entree, which was criticised for the massive construction of areas that had previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001 the investment consultancy and Feri rating company, the software manufacturer for the travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after a year were sold by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers computer companies and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
Branch in the Rhine and Mohan area is one of the largest in Germany, the most employees of Fujitsu are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, other subsidiaries in this area will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the Astro Park administrative building, 7,000 square metres were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the starry soilory, which is 20 years old, is located in addition to others also the central association of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assangem
Wikileaks gets close.
Amazon's Internet service has shut down a platform for detection on its servers.
It is possible that this has become a political pressure since the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic diaries.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is allegedly detained in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is becoming increasingly pressured in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, led by Interpol's list, is to abstain according to one newspaper report in the UK.
"Wickeaks is no longer on Amazon server."
"Free speech in a free country", activists reported a short Twitter release on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, Amazon downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic diaries to handle a high number of access to documents.
With Twitter, he explained Wikileaks to this step: "Fine - our dollars are now wasted by hiring people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers ran a search, published a CNN television station based on information from Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate House Protection Committee threatened Amazon with boycott, informed the British Guardian.
"I wish Amazon would have taken this step sooner, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for a platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, unfairly and inconsiderately, and thus our national security is exposed to danger and thus threatens life on the entire planet," said one statement by the impartial senator.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on the report in London's newspaper "The Independent" 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact place.
An Internet activist has always referred to an investigation in Sweden as the intrigues of his opponents.
The talker Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"There were even challenges to the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange's right to fear for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to statements from North America.
In America, a former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckbee, asked that the person responsible for publishing Wikileaks for treason be charged and executed.
In Canada, one advisor to the government chief Stephen Harper said on TV - perhaps ironically, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use "target plane".
Meanwhile, there was a verbal gunfight between the White House and Assange.
Speaking American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, he called it "miracled and absurd" that Assange has requested the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if he is responsible for recently published spying challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not entirely sure why we're interested in one person's opinion on the website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the country's interests are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now examining the security of its databases extensively.
The Special Commissioner was appointed Deputy Director of Anti-Terrorism Centre Russell Travers, informed the White House.
Travers has become responsible for the development of "required reforms in the structure" which are necessary after the publication of the messages from the embassy to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should get into danger for publication on Wikileaks.
"We dropped everything to get in touch with them," said the Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them, if that would be necessary."
University of Ice cream
Ice cream confectionery prepares for a better season at Gelato University at Bolona.
The basic course for future ice creamers, which lasts three days, is a great interest and visitors come from around the world.
Where does the ice cream actually come from?
From Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatier, a Czech slightly obsolete ice-creamer, produces cream according to all rules of Italian ice-cream art.
Gelatio pulls ice cream out of the coolant, puts it in the bag and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzol dell'Emilia in Bologna.
But who wants to know more about the ice cream, it will not escape the Gelato-University of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, he set up an ice-cream university to match ice-cream from his machines to high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is a huge interest and visitors come from around the world.
However, there are also several-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Someone yearns for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others venture on the thin ice of their unclear desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all worlds - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the movement of Slow-Food and would like to offer a quality European product in the future in the Ice-Cream industrial country.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and she would like to start her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian woman at home Julia came because her children loved Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the ice cream.
It is decisive not only good taste, but also silky silkiness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during her training on the Southern and patriotic cherry cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a small amount of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which all heats with an electronic programme of 85 degrees and then cools immediately at four degrees.
Then it spins on the machine with a tap and leaks pasteurized white cream, the basis of all types of milky ice cream.
Immediately, the docent is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano warns to get carried away by the spirit of time until the unknown.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently used stabilisers equally - mostly a natural product such as guar flour made of guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise the customer will meet and its own ice grain.
Certain variations in basic matter are allowed.
It'll be more intense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes in the taste of ice cream according to ingredients that are bought in a supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to force you a lot of flavoured ingredients."
"You should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets of sugar and fresh fruit.
Or ice cream from white base matter that changes eggs to yellow cream and cocoa on the basis of all sorts of chocolate temptation.
Now he can take a course in ice cream machines.
Luciano will always make them four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and lichen ice cream - either with or without eggs in base matter, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment shall be carried out with fruity types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruity pyres - it is not always better in view of the taste.
Liquorice ice cream may not taste more peanuts when it contains more peanuts.
The most popular ice cream makes up a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture lifts the right taste of Gelato, Luciano says.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach pyra with lots of sugar is used, the sugar content of the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, you need extra sugar.
Luciano pulls out a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (the vine measures the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the automatic production of basic material.
There is also a machine that uses a finished ice cream mixture simultaneously into a cream and cools to the minus the temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will dirty himself and his colleagues from the top to the bottom with fruit feathers when he gets out of control of a huge mixer.
"In every course," said Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Double-light auditors
The Efsa European Food Authority is associated with an industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This charge has now been made by a group of experts from Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institution for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," said Chief Testbiotech Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efs expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efs experts have had a contract for several years with the Ilsa lobby team.
This is financed by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in the control regulations of Efs for genetic plants in a decisive way and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
Efsa's regulations are said to be consistent in all paragraphs with Ilsa's documents and so carry the manuscript of an industry that should be controlled by the Italian Parma office.
It is the second time that Testbiotech draws attention to a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efs passed without accessories or transitional time to the Swiss Agrician Group Syngenta - and this changed the parties.
Also, the Central Germany (MDR) Radio has recently revealed an EU staff link to the industrial lobby, which has aroused the interest of both the Ministry of Environment and EU Members.
Meanwhile, Efs can't recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. those from industry, if they are of high professional quality, it is stated in one statement.
Experts working for the Efs are not required to have contacts with industry.
But he's got to prove it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, to assess the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that currently permitted genetic plants are altered in animals without any feeding attempt and that the environmental effects of genetic plants are not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, geneticly modified corn will do in the fields," says Then.
The current practice is simply to test isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If they are not looking for risks, how could they be found?" asks the prosecution, Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
A scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at a Technical University in Zurich.
In this area, industry as well as in the US are trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who would not be connected with the companies.
Most do not publish studies that are critical to companies.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
Traces of stones
Gsell Street's also got some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was in front of a station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September, coppers arrived and began to tear away a large piece of north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: the thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar reduction of the station.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings lay in ruins.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
A limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldrn, 43.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He must not disappear."
It spreads out, "Lovable and poor stone, simple and dusty."
When one of them cut, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what to do with those pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Gsell Street, too.
The footprint of the Stuttgart stones leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former French army ammunition deposit, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all of them that were created during the Stuttgart bombing.
"It would be a shame if they came down on a gravel or disappeared on a deposit," he says in his office, a wooden box that was previously a guarded house.
He says that he was strangled and threatened by the fact that in September all the newspapers cost him to buy the remnants of the northern wing from a society that carried out the democracy.
But he's been talking to S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for a democracy.
And since it's already happening, it's the smartest thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21-optimists each one about 80 kilograms of heavy block, price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope to return it during the reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cost 25 large trucks.
Half of it's still in the woods, the rest was sold a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came out of all the corners and dragged what was in the trunk and on the trailer.
The Stones of the Stuttgart have long been turned into "tits" or as the margins of the herbs.
"This stone is actually nothing special," said Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political plug."
He gets into his field car and goes for a drive through his 20- hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, study interrupted, later biology, then cared about the computer, and eventually became a stone salesman.
And a stone lover.
He's saved 40,000 tons of rocks.
He weighs his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest merchant with old stones in the Republic.
It's a brake.
In the snow lies an artisticly worked sandstone.
"One belonged to Marien-bridge in Dresden," he relates.
The writer from Laba, yellow, warm, he's excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're on our way up through the woods.
He points to the pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And go on.
"Nice travertine."
Once upon a time, the squares were in the Neckarstadion Tribute in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the police station in Stuttgart, a red granite from the Temple of Sankt Blasien, a tumor from the hospital in Heilbron.
What a job, what an effort, what a journey.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were being crushed by hand and transported using simple hammers and bulls' chariots, it becomes completely respectful.
"It would be scandalous if something like this were crushed."
He didn't become rich, he didn't become very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemakers, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glasssmith, and one gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the person who evaluates the rest.
In due course, he must go to Cologne.
Stones will also be saved there.
The battle of talents on High-potentials
There's a lot of people at the diner.
16 students are pressed for losose bread, tomato soups and sweets.
Technical University in Braunschweig and car manufacturers Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design to a workshop.
Together with VW developers here are to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way to get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies try to compete with the smartest heads in the race, as well as VW, to succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible, recruit the most gifted graduates in the hearing rooms before they reach the labour market and are interested in others.
Since universities do not list the success of their students, companies are trying to discover and acquire exceptional talents in practical-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig trying to get the car company talent the next day.
One young lady in the personal department distributes pens, rubber bears and boards with VW logo.
He tells promising young talent about practical programs, student jobs, and tells them how to go to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"The VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates, and think about who would fit as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is, he's fighting so openly for students.
"On the other hand, it was a rather substantial professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably get tougher.
In many sectors companies are no longer able to select their employees from long ranks of candidates.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract particularly highly skilled labour.
In particular, graduates of engineering fields have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Institute of Engineers, the VDI remained in October without 40,000 engineering positions.
And as predicted by the VDI, the shortage of engineers will continue to grow.
The KPMG's audit and consultancy firm is headed by Roman Dykta to hunt talent.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
Participants can also see KPMG branches and meet the company.
It will be decided in advance in two selection wheels, who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many stakeholders will fly to the US.
In the battle for the High Potentials at the universities, the laws of Dykty will continue to be tougher.
"We want to be different from the others with our Race."
"The simple trip to the sailing boat was too little for us."
It looks like Dykt's talent hunter is lucky.
"We stayed in contact with all participants of a similar event last year."
"Some will soon finish their studies and plan to go to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct address on campus, mainly small and medium-sized companies present classically in the labour markets.
"We're trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"As in Intersolar, for example", says Sitha Stübe, Head of the Personnel Department of Solar Technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue of young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are posted on the company's website.
"It's just complicated right now to occupy vacancies."
"It's a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld works with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Profesors tell us that we can do practice or write a diploma."
A solar specialist doesn't throw expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Great companies often can't offer it," says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
Money has long been playing a major role in the search for work.
The flexible working hours, child care or good options of the procedure are other decisive factors.
Solarworld placed in one study the Great Place to Work 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, the co-workers are asked how they are satisfied with their work and work environment and how they monitor the staff's framework conditions.
The head of the personal department of Stübe hopes her placement will bring points to the job seekers.
"I believe that stakeholders are particularly informed about external evaluations of potential employer," he says.
Wolf Rainer Kriegler from German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy a good reputation as an employer.
They're advising their customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, that means, above all, internal action.
"The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer leads through your own employees," he says.
This is specifically referred to as Internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of an employer on the market within its own employees.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they'll self-advertise their employers between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a string game," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil wells
During the following years, new oil wells will not emerge before the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued an appropriate ban - and has consequently abolished the earlier plans.
New wells are banned so far, too, before the Atlantic coast.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar reported it on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban that should be paid for at least the next five years is the explosion on the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling tower in April.
Prior to this disaster, which cost eleven employees lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the pressure of opposition and industry to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
In this way, advocates try to reduce the dependence of the United States on deliveries of oil from abroad.
To this day, it is not clear who bears responsibility for the devastating oil disaster in the bay.
The centre of criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted by billions of requests.
The Commission of Inquiry commissioned by Obama should present the results in December.
In October, the Minister of Interior, Ken Salazar, lifted the drilling ban that he had paid since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies applied for new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters with more stringent controls and strict security regulations.
At present, a major reform is being made by the control office, which has drawn attention to itself by many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would disrupt the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
Industry now openly warns that stricter regulation will substantially reduce the volume of heavy oil in the bay.
"Governmental plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the gas and oil industry", the result of the current survey in the field by the consultancy company BDO - before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance is still complaining about uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what regulation is going to change."
Investments in new mining projects are moving until appeal - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned down.
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of escaped oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People feed on stealing, corruption, and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't be embarrassed," calms the journalists ecological activist: "Today you get a lot more oil mud before the lens."
A 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who waded through the breasts of water, surrounded by smudges: the scene acts in a watery forest with spiritual colors almost as pretty.
The fact that under the surface there are brown oil clots is not visible.
She used to collect enough garnells in the container, reports Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil spilled into a vast moist area from broken water.
The fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must fish for at least six hours to get into the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, belongs to one of the most polluted areas in the world.
On the way to the river by mangrove swamps with a lot of side tributaries, the entire range of the trigger is still visible.
The boat’s engine boils its brown, brown, instead of light water, and the man who plunges his hand into the water pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves stick out of the ground like black bars of pharmacy, rarely appearing palm trees let their leaves hang sadly.
We are not looking for a flock of birds that normally occur in wet areas: Once the engine is quiet on the boat, it will wander in the former paradise, where it smells like a pump, scary silence.
"What happens here is environmental warfare," says sadly Celestine Akpobari, "we live in constant fear of health."
The comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield, where several decades ago the fighting has taken place: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe, here in the 1980s, formed the first retreat with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiva, here the Shell company had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for employees.
To date, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while the company daily weighs from the whole area of the delta three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 mining drilling yards and 7,000 kilometres of lead more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil field in the Ogoni area of the iceship lies too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters are barbed from the water of the steel structure as bizarre sculptures: " Christmas trees", so they are too gently called the heads of drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, mostly rusty to sea.
Every moment such a head of a drilling hole breaks, says Akpobari, and then pours a constant stream of oil into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres of oil per 50 years were released into the delta ecosystem: each year, the amount of oil spilled into the sea near Alaska during the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes over who are responsible for the continuing environmental disaster.
While Shell describes sabotage and organized theft of oil for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists speak of bursting heads of wells and loose conduct as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than in the world, he complained to the US-American scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only a number of lead disorders are said to be "severely higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks remotely abandoned, oil-based workshop under the wide sky, it emerges from the character's mangroves: they are completely naked and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly bound by leadership, partly scattered around the earth, fire burns: illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First comes out of the lead into the capture pot gasoline, later drips at the end of the kerosene and finally oil.
This is how Michael and his four coworkers produce up to four barrels a day of 300 litres: "We'll make about 34,000 Naira" -- about $22.
The inhabitants of the delta use the chronic lack of fuel in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of EUR 40 cents per litre of oil can still be overrun by illegal producers: because they have free raw material.
It comes from "bunkers" who connect to lead everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, in the whole area of the Niger Delta, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost daily.
But only a marginally small part of the carefully stored raw materials will illegally be billed: The largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, to which both politicians and high-ranking military representatives belong, into tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate on whether they have caused the disaster and its interventions or its lax way of production is considered by Akpobari's activist to be purely academic.
"If oil companies were not considered an alien, and if they didn't completely destroy the life of fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni relationship is particularly damaged to Shell, which is considered only to be the departure of the company: "Perhaps other nations like the Chinese will appear as better."
Michael's worried.
"It's time for you to disappear," says a muscular producer.
"Any minute soldiers can come."
If a special military unit found them, they wouldn't be in prison, but a painful bribe.
Soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
"This damned thing has got our land in all respects to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous building error in A380 engines.
A380 clearly has a major security malfunction.
Investigators discovered a possible building error during a search of a machine that had accidentally landed, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
On the emergency landing, Qantas passengers had apparently more luck than they knew before: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority found a major safety failure in its investigations on the engines of some A380 - and now warns against a possible construction error.
Perhaps the failure would have serious consequences: a single oil connection could cause cracks due to weariness, said this Thursday in a published statement to the ATSB.
This could lead to "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines made by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is an airbus of Qantas, which had to land in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine producer.
It justified the action before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal measures against this company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said that his company would seek compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released, and they damaged the nasal surfaces.
Rolls-Royce identified the cause of the damage to the burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be switched around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out additional safety tests with the giant aircraft equipped with the engines concerned.
The security recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said spokesman ATSB Martin Dolan.
The security deficiencies were considered to be of sufficient importance to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a security measure.
A two-storey plane is the largest personal plane in the world.
The nationwide snowfall causes chaos in transport
Germany is all white: almost all the country snowed overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, train connections and airplanes being disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the whole republic fell into the snow on Thursday night at freezing temperatures - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, it lies in some places up to a foot [15 cm] of snow.
On several highways and many roads there is very limited traffic.
On the A7 in Flensburg, the road service was still on its way, but it didn't manage the new snow.
There was still a strong storm over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Sailing and Hydrography (BSH) expects to be on the coast of the Baltic Sea in Szlesvik-Holštynsk in the morning a storming flood with a water condition of 1.2 metres above normal.
The snowfalls caused considerable problems in Saxony on highways and state roads.
According to the weather centre, Meteomedia was therefore the highest degree of alarm on purples in Saxony Switzerland.
From the section there occurred 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused the curtains.
There were a few trucks left at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhaltsk, police authorities reported major road problems.
A2 caused wind and snow to slow traffic and traffic jams.
In Durinsk there were trouble over the snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German route, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhaltsko, Durinsk and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on track, overturned trees on tracks or broken upper lines and bends.
Remote traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg must have been stopped in Saxony.
In Durin's Saalfeld, he had to stop one I.C. into Munich.
165 passengers were given on the train by firefighters and paramedics of woolen blankets, food and drink.
The snow wind was rolling across the road.
In large German airports, many years were cancelled due to snow winds.
According to the speaker, information centres for years have already been reported from Munich’s cancelled flights.
In Frankfurt our Mohan has been canceled by the Speaker of the Fraport for 40 years.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
Although there are only a few unconnected passengers at the airport, 400 field beds are ready for them.
There have been accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, one truck driver died in a crash with a train on a rail crossing in eastern Holštynsk.
The machine driver was slightly injured.
The snowed road caused a similar accident near Nuremberg: a truck was also caught here at the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
Driver's dead.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until morning hours.
And a 30-year-old woman died after she turned on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg with her car.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow remains in the form of light dust, and so it will rise in the light waves of the wind.
But the wind will go down.
Only by the Baltic Sea will there be quick winds of wind.
But it's going to be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for tower-doubles
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to his mark: according to one newspaper report, a buyer's bank is looking for two towers with offices at Frankfurt headquarters.
Real estate could cost up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: the tower-doubles in the Frankfurt banking district were modernized; in the meantime, bankers were able to resume their old jobs.
But now he probably wants the financial company to renovate again - and he's looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland reports with a recall to the speaker.
The speaker didn't name the reasons for the sale planned.
"We are constantly exploring whether it is more meaningful to own or sell property and then rent again," he said.
In this way, the largest credit institution in Germany again gives up its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The Bank only took over the towers and twins in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from its own fund investors and then renovated them costlyly.
The energy transformation of the regimen according to the data of around 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate, according to the newspaper text, the value of the meanwhile renamed towers to "Greentovers" at a price of around EUR 500 million.
The speaker said it was not decided whether the building would be resold into the assets of the fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of grieving dead miners.
More than 10,000 people worshiped the memory of sunken miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions down there.
Still, it has not been possible to free the dead, because the security situation in the shaft remains complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
The 29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the lower plain.
A probe was launched into the shaft, but there was no sign of life.
Because of high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not be deployed for safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts came out of the fact that miners no longer had any chance of survival.
Still failed to deliver the dead.
Now they worshiped the memory of dead relatives and friends.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand for sunny weather.
They've been silent for two minutes.
29 tables were built for the observance of the memorial of the buried miners, on them helmets, lamps, and the names of the miners.
Also images and personal belongings, such as clothes and surfboards found their place here.
There were half-fares of flags on government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come out of the depths of the country again, said to the participants in the commemorative event the Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead, said Lavrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the bottom.
Several foreign diplomats were also involved in the event in addition to the Prime Minister and related victims.
During the explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also flooded.
Rescuers started by firing fires inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as toxic gases dissolve, it starts cooling high temperatures inside the mine, said police president Gary Knowles to the Journalists.
Hell, warriors!
Does the horror gourmet fit the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome the old border with his "Wallala Rising" fight episode.
What kind of audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he was shooting "Walhala Rising"?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be freed from his torturers and in large measure kills almost with the supernatural strength of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young male viewers who are looking for bloody action because our hero is helping with cruel methods of killing and his enemies even fights the guts of the belly when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-Eye, as he is actually called, will not say a word during the entire film, and the other characters will carry at least one or two sentences, or they will be allowed to fall to the passionate dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and they are playing in a dreadfully beautiful hilly region of Scotland, which offers the Vikings a landscape about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult fans of cinema with an interest in existentialism and very peaceful footage of the camera.
It's good when a movie has more target groups, it's only a shame when they're excluding each other.
Director Winding Refn, after making his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantin, but instead defends himself to bring his works closer to either the humor of the main stream or less brutal to the artist's audience.
Most fans of the art cinema are likely to be discouraged by spraying their brains and guts everywhere.
The supporters of the action films will be bored at the latest at the moment that the One-Eye will be released for freely explained reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries shiping to Jerusalem and will remain hanging forever in the wind and fog before perhaps the men join the Americas and remain silent there.
So there is no wonder that in Germany "Walla Rising" did not get to the movies and was now released only to DVDs.
It's a pity mainly because of the beautiful footage, but also because it's behind a personal facade, places up to the blood pool, hides an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
In this film, it's not a dialogue or an exact event, it's all an atmosphere, a burning dream that's become a film.
And it's not for the viewer to escape.
Refn won't give him a moment of relaxation and slowly chokes him with his cloudy images and cloudy hypnotic soundtracks, especially the indescribable hatred that wanes from the heart figures.
Only a little blond boy who helps One-Eye keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by rage.
Of all the most one-eyed heroes whose motives will never be explained, which will become time for enemies and transition allies as a warrior from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
He's producing destruction, perhaps but also only for the depraved ones.
"Walhala Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
The experience.
Mysterious Land Work
The IAEA Nuclear Power Authority has a new alert to the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country defends its expression - and does not even allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli combat aircraft F-15 I will attack the mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IEEA) reveal its name when it is a reactor that is allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley that is turning away from the current.
Based on a communication from the CIA US-American Foreign Secret Service of late April 2008, a reactor known also under the name of the nearby village of El Kibar would be well suited to the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technique from the '50s is no different.
The CIA presented a video of unfocused satellite images.
By means of computer animation, it has clarified which components of the reactor before it could be destroyed, should be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
In addition, photographs were still presented that showed the building near or even from the inside.
The reactor said it was shortly before the launch, but no fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, there is not much more than that, even the puzzles have increased over time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently announced in his memory that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building in an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no evidence that there was an "active nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
Some intelligence secret services in Europe are even more cautious and talk only about "the alleged reactor", even though CIA presentations consider it "trustworthy".
They lack clear evidence, as well as IAEA.
On the question of how certain he is that he has a reactor, he answered a senior UN diplomat in the summer, the IAEA said it has "the material to ask questions".
The dry allegedly "unused military building" was quickly removed and also properly lined up the terrain.
However, it was possible to find in June 2008 the IAEA team under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received through the Member State satellite photographs of commercial vendors from the time immediately following the attack, which should be more sophisticated than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they were exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria always claimed she never had a secret nuclear program and never built a reactor.
Uranus came from Israeli weapons, expressed himself Damashek.
But that's what the IAEA reversed after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss things as well as satellite images.
In addition, he banned the auditors from the second inspection in El Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed building.
But Israel also shuts up.
"We will never comment," confirmed recently the official opinion of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time.
The investigation of this case has been carried out continuously since June 2008 and is "increasing to a serious problem in view of the credibility of the Authority", as acknowledged by the IAEA High Western Diplomat in Vienna - it is indeed a serious breach of the nuclear-weapons ban treaty that the IAEA is overseeing.
The IAEA considers the key to progress in three other devices to be "in a functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
The auditors, however, have not yet indicated which device is involved, nor what function or why they are suspected.
According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, once again based on nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found them on satellite images of buildings, which is probably one of the suspect objects.
Apparently it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason it rejects Syria's access to these three places.
In Vienna it was said that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would have been sent in advance by the United States to search out military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the facility by US Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite images that between these three places and the square at Euphrates transported the material here and there.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one well-managed should be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there is no "no evidence of sensitivities", i.e. the enrichment of uranium and new processing; the processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by a uranium that is not enriched.
But where does the uranium come from and where the plutonium should be recovered from it on the bomb, there are only likely estimates on these central issues.
It is also unknown whether the debris that could hide important traces is preserved in these three places.
As if hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the surface of the earth, no one seemed to have the information to which it had gone.
Only a few kilometres away from el-Kibar, and on the other side of the Euphrates lying salt mine al-Tibni, which let Syria check in 1998 as an appropriate storage facility for radioactive waste, considers the IAEA unlikely.
Former IAA Inspector Robert Kelley put him into contact with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from the universe show that after the IAEA requested access, it carried out Syria in all suspicious places of land work and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, they speak diplomatic circles about the fact that the IAEA spent many months creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to preserve any military secret - only the effort to demonstrate the great interest of the auditors.
In the meantime, the ladyship rejected this proposal.
If, a year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna calmed down that the reactor was destroyed, and that is why this thing is not burning, the US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the strongest means that the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
Although Chief IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already spoken of "the possibility to which in future clones" but he hesitates so far.
This option poses a major risk: On the one hand, the majority of the IAEA Board of Governors needs to do so, and many of the 35 countries represented do not have a strong interest in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love in the Time of War
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on a nameless first-line job in the summer, there have been troubles.
She wrote the script herself, it's a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known yet - but it also causes unrest.
It is always said that the Muslim woman will fall in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, so the planned recording from Sarajevo was moved to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film was made in Hungary and is in post production, but in Bosnia it is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN-Organization to help the refugees of UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also the Ambassador of the UN-Organization to help refugees.
It's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where the rape took place, the love stories didn't work out, and Jolie's attitude about the victims was telling a lot about the script.
Her organisation therefore recommended that the UN organize to assist refugees to release Jolie as Ambassador, informs the Guardian.
What scene did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her script read, allowed for smaller moves in Sarajevo to be filmed - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author points out that she does not follow any political intentions in her film that she devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give all the parties involved space.
Due to its contents, it remains indeterminate.
On the Internet there is another version of the film that sounds really different: the lovers knew each other before the war began and they meet again when she is like a Bosnian Muslim dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer".
The fact that the film Jolie really starts before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that there is a pressure on her that "is not fair and based on misinformation".
Now they can free her from Hollywood hackers: By illegally publishing on the internet her script, as many times have done.
Nothing but away
It's good for the Irish again this evening.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates too much of its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy at the sound of loud music, ass-kicking.
Bailey-Pub in South Cork boils because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and hit.
"Pive Pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and for this ticket to Las Vegas at the world championship in beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screaming beer game and a slow computer, it doesn't work together.
Yet, a 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, to respond to the difficult questions that the future will bring.
His plan is not a playing passion in Las Vegas, going to an interview with New Zealand in January.
"I have this weird feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home, they've tried their luck abroad for two of Tanner's three siblings.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT representative in London.
Boys leave: Just like Tanner looks like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict experts from the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of the ESRI in Dublin.
They count even by 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, it is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar displacement wave that Ireland suffered in the 1980 ’ s.
After a decade of uplifting that brought great prosperity to the Irish people, the displeasure is spreading again.
In particular, the economic crisis affects young, educated Irish people, who have only experienced an increase so far.
The loss of employment and social inclusion seemed absurd in these years.
The need was everyone, the money was too much.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men under thirty years of age are unemployed.
In Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: "In Ireland everything is coming downhill."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away and our country loses the whole generation."
"Please turn off the last one."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees the future black because the government only deceives and offers young people no prospects for the future.
"They redefine the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20-year-olds.
He watches her classmates wander from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she's going to have to move herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarn try to see the subject positively.
McLarnan organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a total service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners on the labour market is working abroad is a great chance to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website there are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
About what it's like to build somewhere else, he's known Sean O'Donovan for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen right now.
In January he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts so he can pay a house loan.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says, when for the first time in a long time it goes beyond the threshold of its own house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm basically not."
He laughs in despair and walks in cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, parking large expensive cars in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent funded by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, easy money was without many questions," he says.
Is he worried it wouldn't have to go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, he pours hot tea, and he says, "I don't have children I have to live and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
A construction engineer doesn't like yelling, which he hears so often right now.
"No one needs to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it was on this island," he says.
"If we work abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who left for the last economic crisis in England.
After seven years he was back and life moved on in Ireland, quite simply.
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep an open future and just wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He's been working in London for several years now, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend?
But there's one other thing that worries him a lot these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might turn into a bachelor party.
"No emotions at all," she says, and she'll have a lot of beer.
"Bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a departure party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common practice of democracy
Democracy support in Latin America is growing, as is supporting private business.
Criminal activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey of Latinobarometry, which took place in 18 countries and came out exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in positions across the entire area.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and early October, two related matters dominate.
The first is that Latin America has a rather happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific coast in South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth is on average 6% annually since 2002, the support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
She also grew up in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most populous areas, are the beliefs of the democrats, which download the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001 when it was 25%, it is a big increase (graf 3).
About 34% said they trusted the House in their country and 45% trusted the Government, once again the same numbers as last year, but it was a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
Support emerged during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and rejoiced with a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network helped to protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin American people living in poverty only slightly increased in 2009 and again dropped to 32% in this year.)
But the mood is changing in a wide range from country to country (see Chart 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President Luis Inacia Luly da Silva are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where recession was more serious and the state of violent crime deteriorated.
Only the second time that surveys have started, they see more respondents across Latin America as the most important crime problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or their close relatives became victims of crime in the last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% of last year's data and is also the lowest since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private business and market economy: around 71% of respondents across the entire area say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela share the same view (and 80% of them support private business), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country with a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% last year (as opposed to 18%), followed by the United States (9% compared to last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and in much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critiqued elections
No one expected the general elections to Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were much worse than the outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The elections meant full hours and repeated voting, ballots scattered over the canals, broken elections rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, roamed around and tried to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of supposed drafters, shouted that it was a fraud and called for the abolition of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, said that "it was in many respects a rather good election."
Observers from the Organization of the American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that "they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they were, did not necessarily cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The election body, whose opposition votes are binding on René Préval, the unpopular outgoing President and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is scheduled to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Mangat, the former first lady, resigned from their initial call to declare the vote invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support between the voters, is identified by the electoral commission as achieving a decisive battle.
Because of the ongoing epidemic of cholera and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voting participation would be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
About 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for the vote, remained shortly before the elections were undivided.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear that the Haitians are doing so on their own.
After tiptoe to the center
In the weeks when she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, lives out of sympathy for the public, when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, the reversal of this success in a successful second term campaign in elections next year may depend on the fact that the grieving Mrs Fernández will give up uncompromising her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs, everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife had become president, was in the habit of compiling budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to lose another income according to the will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost most of the Congress last year.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized at Mr. Kirchner's death on a heart attack on October 27th.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (in which the crackdown and accusations of corruption were being made), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to deny it," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also be paid for next year, with the President spending more space according to his will.
The economy is overheating: this year it is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about the figure approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, set the priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to act with the IMF, loaded the private sector and cleaned up the INDEC, a statistical agency that had acceded to the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Now can President Fernández moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade unions.
And her officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was encouraged by the rise in world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted the growth based on the big devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández knows she wants to renew Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government created an agreement with bond holders who had previously refused to restructure a debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
President Fernández is now facing an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion to him.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact should not be supervised by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index that would resemble an introduction to the cleaning of INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of the term of office when her husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If he wants to win the next election, he will have to decide whether it is not necessary to give up many of the opinions her husband held in politics.
Half Encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the authorized elected on 27 November the mayor and council of the city in five city districts, which can be considered to be a wider assessment of President Ma Ying-You.
President Ma himself is the representative of the feelings that have prevailed firmly and have been strongly established in business relations, including the partial free trade agreement, in the greatest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma has passed the test, but only in close order.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayor's offices, she could not win by majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is favored by greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it was the presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the vote of his party has decreased by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP side was together with KMT in city councils.
The elections took place like most of the Taiwanese elections, which include noisy lorries and mass gatherings with flags with a bunch of dressed girls.
Part of it was even a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honourable Chairman of the KMT, was promoted for KMT candidates in the eve of the election.
The man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien over his face, hurt him, and killed the viewer.
It was not specified whether the gunman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards the KMT.
I hope China was the only big winner of the campaign.
It was remarkable how the issue of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates are pro-policies about plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
KMT therefore tends to avoid government ties in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also given up on the rise of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact that China's trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma confirmed for his part that China's policy was acceptable to most Taiwan.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue to pay commercially, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
They would certainly like to see political integration, but in a row.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
In any case, the DPP site found itself.
Two years ago she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The President in 2000-08 was a storm and a rebel of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai was summoned as a DPP candidate for the president, such as Su Tseng-hang, who held office under Mr Chen.
Their side is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai has published plans for research institutes serving as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their proceedings can take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai reports to the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr Ma's elegant approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In a statement issued by his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's evaluation was bad, despite the excessive pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His lack of love seems to be based in particular on unemployment and deepening the gap between the rich and the poor.
The KMT speaker says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as well as the local branches.
Strong proposals to support Taiwan for establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, the prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has passed."
Grammy Award nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
A performance at the request of the President and people must be taken into account in law.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer, whom President Obama chose to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, is named as one of the surprises of Grammy awards this year with a nomination in the category of best new artist.
Given that Spalding was a celebrated character on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in line with the Grammy rules, when an artist can't issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is determined."
Her ambitious album from 2010 "Chamber Music Society" certainly marked a step forward and thanks to her carefree vocal style and flexible hand with elements of pomp, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Norah Jones recorded in 2003 as the nearest equivalent for voters in Grammy who are looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Other jurors of Gramma rightly appreciate the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing album ride that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and John Beasley's "Positotly."
Trombone Shorty, a frantic New Orleans favorite and a frequent guest in the HBO "Treme" series was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise favored by Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained several well-deserved recognitions in the category of large files, where in competition there was a chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the Octe "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a band.
Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in classical music category
The nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at 53rd annual Gramma prices.
The head of the nomination has Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" as a piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eccletic orchestral work, with a number of three points.
Among the nominees with ties to South California was the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandoline Concerto also has a chance to award.
The nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music of the year has five nominated Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was given by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the categories of opera, the nominations are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kai Saaria and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Schedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariansky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated for Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffeti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered in Disney Hall in January 2009 for the performances recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salon.
Approximately 30 minute part is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and Mandolin Concerto were nominated for the soloist's instrumental performance with the orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for the mandoline interpreter Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it with the help of tone from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for the lead of Chicago Symphony in recording the works of Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nomination are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists, only women were represented this year, including Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Meash Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical transition she won the nomination of soprano Jessie Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecule gets the approval of the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public witnessing.
Critics have attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in line with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project - the Christians, the Jews, to whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Center at Temecul Valley, on Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of the American citizen."
"It means justice will always prevail."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"Those who oppose only shout aloud."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The talks began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted until almost midnight, when most of the time they held discussions with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly divided, says Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the news website.
"There is no more America," one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty fallen into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, the tragedy scene, which took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York City.
In Temecula Valley I have Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community of some 135 families co-existed in Riverside County for years without incident, but wished for more and more space than storage space, which he rented together with a filter system manufacturer.
The new mosque with dimensions of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should cover a 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometres east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the space for searching for new life forms on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and fundamental.
"This organism has dual ability."
"It can grow either by phosphorus or arsenic."
"This is a very strange fact, but it is not proof that this is a form of real 'mymomous' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a coauthor of the news that appeared on Thursday in Science's online magazine.
Six main elements of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur were considered necessary for life.
Scientists have nevertheless found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"You will be amazed at what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This find is important for finding life outside of Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this news published in order to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of finding, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar elements, so she thought that the microb, which is exposed to both elements, can be able to replace one after the other.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very difficult to separate these elements from themselves."
"However, the arsenic is so different that just like phosphorus doesn't work. When it gets into the organism, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better when phosphorus is applied, but given that they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility is increased that the form of life used by arsenic can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or on a month where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but never found an example to prove it.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could have been used in earlier forms of life.
"This indicates that there could have been other ways of creating life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining dogs were found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower Motel were found. He informed the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department on Thursday.
Four exhibition dogs - two Akites and Velšké pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, told the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs then Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say where exactly the dogs were found in which location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught in order to comment on the case.
They were very happy when their two akits found themselves at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's agents found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old Trace dog and 10-month-old Didi, were unharmed, told by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek tribes, who were planning to take part in the field competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, were not found until they were discovered late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the ACC/Eukanuba National Championship at the Long Beach, where they were planning to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions planned the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, said the Peek daily The Times on Wednesday.
South California is only one stop on almost a month travelling steam after dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car outside the room window.
They also took three dogs with them - boxer puppy, Parson Russell terrier and a Bretan ogre - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akita and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car, where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little bit so the dogs in the car could have enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported car theft at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who'd lead them to missing dogs, and the dogs had implanted microchips to identify them.
Thursday, it was not clear whether prices would be awarded.
The lion is ready to scream again now when the restructuring of MGM receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got green to start over.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvency Judge of New York officially blessed the "front-packed" plan of creditors to settle about $5 billion of debt and thus clear the way for 86-year-old entertainment society, which focuses on the production and production of movies and television shows.
Fourthly, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Competitive Order, and there are no legal obstacles to restarting the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders of the reduced studio.
The number of employees drops to about 320 of the original more than 400.
MGM does not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance new operations and production of MGM.
It is now a connection with the investment bank, which itself needs $75 million and funding is expected around half December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances, as management fought to afford interest of $300 million a year.
This August was replaced by President Harry Sloan by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and an expert on the turnover known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts by Moelise and Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 creditors of the study lasted much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to sell the company by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay US$ 2 billion plus the finances that the creditors demanded.
In the spring of this year everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million in payment.
Cooper's companies, which collect for their services that run the company, $375,000 a month, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production in MGM, which this year released only one film and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films that will be proposed by the book "Hobit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, was looking for the possibility of combining the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technological toys that keep your budget on gifts in balance
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing toy iPad, followed by the video game system. However, in both cases it is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX rounds for 99 dollars and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 coral screws or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
There is, however, a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy salesmen - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was working; this year's technological toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to last years.
While there were relatively fewer new toys with associated websites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with buttons, as well as toy with batteries charging, is increasing.
Here are some recommendations.
(All listed prices are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases which are otherwise marked.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their belly.
One press produces an animal tone, and the second press starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start machining, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, from 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animator doll on Elmo Live Technology, who can play Simon Says and can also walk a month thanks to his innovation clutch with wheel blocking.
The kids are testing Mickey's toy dance instructor, although their parents are complaining about lack of volume control.
If you're a kid in the '80s, maybe you'll remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, 40$, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn the car ride into a fun job with a self-warranted, funny workbook.
If you're screwing on the smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with easy use, with qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective lessons as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change in the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with the older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on the SD card that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a set of five cubes that are no bigger than a box of matches, each of which has a LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before the time runs out; it is great for competition in improvised word formation.
Still more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in toys.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old, which contains a coin with hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child will receive enough credit at Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include a roller skate or a Puffle animal.
A little bigger than the brush of your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years of age), the latest of the series of microbots on a button battery.
The beetle moves rapidly onto 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's fun to make a loophole out of cubes and see if he can find his way out.
He's also very resilient.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and spend even some time in our dog's basement.
The introduction of gentler police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked across the square, scrutinized his orders and issued orders in half with military authority.
He wanted women members - Chinese permanent extorts of urban order, feared and despised for their hard moves and violent ambitions - to mediate a certain impression of the commotions of the surrounding.
Stand straight!
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering silently, "How pretty girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood out.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted according to ruler.
Four head coverings perfectly fit on hair that are perfectly bound with blue and white ribbons.
"I personally think they look on average," said Mr. Tang excruciatingly.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered new recruits to have higher education.
Guangdong Province has turned grey-green uniforms into supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced his cautious glances for strong weapons: in 2009, one report stated that 50 officers surrounded the truck with snacks and looked intently at the owners when the salesman packed and drove away after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose operations as the main image.
Since 2003, the county has complemented its city police with 13 women selected specifically according to their appearance, proportionality and young age.
The goal is to show the police a gentler, female side, besides the rough side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson himself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
They would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce a municipal decree, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media are usually picking up a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province withdrew an unbiased viewer to death after he used his cell phone to shoot, as they do in protest proceedings against the landfill.
Last year there were training of police officers in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. Among other things, there was a description of how to effectively beat the attackers without signs of blood.
This year, a submersible merchant with melons in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered injury to the left of the brain.
A video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, lamented last year after further discussion of tactics.
The paper was "really thoroughly cleaned."
Skeptics say that this approach is not enough.
After the period of interest in October for eight new female police officers, The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real responsibilities or were just distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The period required women candidates between 18 and 22 years of age with a good figure and "fonds of facial features in the right proportion."
Adaptors should have a height higher than the average - i.e. above 1.6 meters.
Service at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials say that work is psychologically too demanding for women over 25 years of age.
"their image is an important thing," said one unnamed policeman on Rednet.com, as if by government websites.
"The candidates must first prove the external quality, which they then define others, include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes a number of character and "internal quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said, and he added, "Besides that they're bound, they'll also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of county management, disagrees with this description very much.
But he pointed out that the height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
Just like the demand for proportional facial features.
Which means that the issue of good sense is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
Medically disabled or crippled is certainly not applicable.
"He can't allow a lame or hunchy man to serve with us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps watch on Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn't think that the emphasis on her appearance might have a sexual impact, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her coworker with the dollies, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the city's image."
They did not object to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just starting traders into the streets where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning a group stands up against more than ten marketers running on foot or bikes and trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you many times!" said Ms. Xu, when the marketer ran away, and for time left his wheel with his noodles cart.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day is essentially the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the power to confiscate goods from their male counterparts.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The trend is then to protect them from sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after false rumors were spread that the police had killed the vendors.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or burned.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can only be guaranteed with difficulty.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang square, where police patrols were held this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The police confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner could cry like he wanted.
15 minutes away from the cops, facing rage, with elbows against the vehicles, and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator of the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 years of age who already have only a supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and image smoothing.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said in a matter of fact.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts with it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign.
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges involving his affair with a former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, advised the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, the Nevada Republican, faced and was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. Its affair reached national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said that he was the decision that followed almost after the annual investigation, "sure pleased".
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings with the Senate's ethical commission.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that he is not planning to press any further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign had prepared a violation of the Federal Lobby ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Mr Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to ensure a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a cashier in the Ensign campaign.
Mr Ensign has contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after they have hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, so many mention documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was until now Mr Ensign's assistant, he was expelled from the law from the lobbying of his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts argue that the unusual settlement of Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were friends before the affair, was contrary to the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that has been published "it appeared that it is a clear case of a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are investigated by the government.
While officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensign, Mr Brand and other lawyers with a specialisation on ethics, the Ministry is cautious about the political lawsuits, after a large number of setbacks, including last year's decision to suspend the action against former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of the charge of doubting the State's representative.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid the weapons", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), an attorney group who filed several complaints against Mr Ensign in the matter.
"It shows essentially that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Lawyer of Mr Ensign, in an interview, told him that he had been called by the Ministry of Justice's attorney on Monday and then on the second day, and told him that the Ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defense team cooperates with the prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in the midterm statement, "dealed in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had given to the State's representatives.
"It is not pleasant for me to deal with the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop an investigation into a separate complaint, in which the ethnic group filed charges that the payment of Ensign's parents to the Hamptons amounted to $96,000 in violation of the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it had insufficient evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbyism was NV Energy, the main Nevada company that has long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 proved that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyist, the head of Mr. Ensign's staff - John Lopez - had communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "busted" to the Ministry of the Interior about the subject under discussion.
Mr Ensign also took part in lunch with Mr Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline company after they hired Mr Hampton to do lobby work.
When last year's first news of the affair appeared, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned to his function as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the Senate's third election period.
In a report that Mr Ensign no longer aims to investigate the crime of his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the ethical commission would follow the Ministry of Justice quickly and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Nevada people," she said.
The challenge of the village of Cheshire turns to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in the courtroom.
A minute later, they sent reports of a terrible witness on Twitter.
In the end, defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter reports dealt with rape and child imprisonment in the house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, was scheduled to officially end the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have already filed an appeal against the courts with applications and arguments that the court would probably be employing for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - has created a "circular atmosphere" and this extended, immediate penetration of information with stimulating details then led the jury to make a decision with a view to affecting public opinion.
This claim could make the judge wonder whether new rules in the courtroom should also be required with the introduction of new technologies.
"As I have experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defender of Mr. Hayes.
The judge of the trial in question, Jon C. Blue, the Supreme Court of the State, briefly rejected the allegations concerning the return from last week and the fact that the media were "beautifully controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under public influence.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades the courts have recognised that reporting of notorious cases can raise questions about the justice of the process.
In the 1966 judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, the verdict of the Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when in his decision he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the "carneval atmosphere" was the subject of the communication process.
Some believe that this crime was an inspirational television show and a movie called "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts which examined Hayes' judgment half a century later might be surprised to find that there might be a need for new rules that determine how to communicate from the courtroom, which was inconceivable in the case of Dr Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor of legal Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying that it was carried out voluntarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be engrossed in the idea that restricting direct communication from the courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is only one of Mr. Hayes' many well-designed lawyers who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the judgment.
Lawyers, for example, argue that in the case of Mr Hayes, it may be a pre-connection, when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential judges by showing them the crime photos of horror when choosing a jury.
Some of the judges said they were horrified by the photos of the victims that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Lawyers argue that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a jury who was critical of the state's representatives and that by his decision he wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jury wasn't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scale of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They objected to last month's verdict that the case dominated the reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the Governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were constantly fanning the flames of emotion in this case.
"The daily news rush, the cameras and reporters before the court," wrote the lawyer, "was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven and is possibly also a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more discouraging than the reports later said and, in their view, the judicial police should manage the scope of other proceedings.
But some lawyers have demanded appeals courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require adjustment of courts.
Mr Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Dr Sheppard, in view of the breadth of the proceedings and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard case versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
After a campaign that was remarkable for its insults and negativity, a small amount of politeness appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first line of genuine cooperation between the two political parties or just an illusion moment before a quick return to a party fight in the capital city?
The Tuesday's meeting of President Obama and Parliamentary Leaders did not bring up any fundamental findings on the core issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion on the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party engagement.
The Central Public Meeting of the President's Deficit Commission was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for a few months has built mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological divide that the members are still dividing.
And it's quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both parties are now in the trial period - questioning each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, seeking to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience against the renewed side war.
That is why Tuesday meetings and its later assessment of the participant were also held with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the relationship that has prevailed here over the last two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"There is no question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You are inevitable after the election.
The elections aroused the emotions of the constituencies, and then they shut up.
It's okay."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the session, the Republicans and Democrats have a small chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax reduction at the end of the year is over and no one sees it as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, whether permanently or temporarily.
Like a likely compromise on unemployment benefits, it is only because the Republicans cannot see how they support tax cuts for the property, while the unemployed refuse to support unemployment.
Following Tuesday's White House negotiations, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, together with ratification of the new launch contract.
But William Galston of Brookings Institute points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between the two political parties when the 112nd Congress calls for January.
More likely a period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After things have been done that must be done, psychology will, in a short perspective, return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely extended - to the fact that courtesy will lead them to real cooperation.
"I am looking at all events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the construction of a new Republican majority in the White House and the volition of tea parties that helped to create it.
Republican leaders are now facing a danger of recovery, knowing that they must behave according to their promises and must reduce government spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These preferred lines are clear in initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing some taxes, raising pension age and reducing expenditure.
Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and are, in their opinion, to put pressure on deficits to the public programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in an 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore fight to get as close to this number as possible.
The greatest resistance is among elected jury officials who suggest that, in the case of financial issues, we have, at least today, a small basis or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary republicans.
The first begins next year in the form of side conflicts, when the Republicans call Obama to resolve the budget, taxation and health care, when the period of greater side cooperation will follow.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There's a lot of evidence that despite the party's recent elections, most Americans still want to see two sides that work together.
If it could be directed to the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will follow the public’s reactions very closely.
Whoever will be threatened with a reduction in votes, will probably change course and seek a compromise.
That could be an optimistic view of the thing.
The country and direction are now larger than it was in the mid-1990s and it turns out that there was a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary republicans than in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a foreplay for more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that has appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will be worth a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
The highlighted American document portrays Moscow as a refuge for corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of "kleptokrat" and continues part of the bribery and protection payments that come on the way to Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in the February records.
Police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organised crime groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "government vertical" - will take its own when the money starts moving up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington on behalf of Ambassador John Beyrlie, was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record shall be based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accused him of a large share of corruption.
He was withdrawn in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only monitor minimal changes in clearance.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, constantly denied allegations of corruption for many years, and won several lawsuits for false accusations of such defamation.
He said to the Russian television station in September when he was asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap."
Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of that the diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The government of Moscow and its connection with criminal lives have led some to call it 'disfunctional,' and confirm that the government acts more like a clecracy than a government," the report said.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'crisha' (the term of the crime world and the mafia, which literally means 'top' or protection), provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the State Attorney's Office, as well as all over Moscow's government bureaucracy.
"The analysts have identified a three-degree structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Lushkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of the Interior and militia are on second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in certain areas as the city does not provide any services."
The report says that the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "trade owners in Moscow realize that it is better to gain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (more than organized criminal groups) because they do not have only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer on course."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection itself can already have problems; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay fast enough are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but has admitted that he has made only small progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably stuffed cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said George Satanov, director of Moscow's Indem Research Team in a recent interview.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class because there are no political classes in Russia anymore."
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that Russia's corruption costs more than $300 billion a year nationwide.
The country ranks 154th in the recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (land is classified from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the report of the US Embassy, which appeared in Moscow only in late evenings, certainly did not arouse enthusiasm with the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov's shortcomings could be blamed on Luzhkov, it could be for Kremlin's argument in the matter of problem solving.
In an interview with Larry King, he told Putin that the documents WikiLeaks published could have been fakes and reacted bitterly to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole issue is that it is about our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, unethically."
The Red Khmer Veterans are forced to deal with the past
In a spore of illuminated concrete textbooks with dirty and robbed walls, the head of the Anlong Veng High School Men School who built it, the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his harshness during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, he remains a commander in this remote country of the Khmer Rouge in north-west Cambodia, popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Reds surrendered to governments, there is a broken long-lasting loyalty also in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victims of the truth and reconciliation were allowed to confront people who were part of the regime in public.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining for the first time to the children the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, the United Nations brought together and the Cambodia Court the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the verdict of a former leader, the notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With all such progress, he grew restless among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintroduce himself into Cambodian society.
"The former Khmer Rouge is a source of passion and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organisation investigating the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, it is estimated that 1.7 million people were executed or starved, sick or processed.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrowed the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara drove guerrilla wars from their base in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated a foothold in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of Red Khmer warriors began to turn to the government, which culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured in 1999 by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons were no longer guarding them, most of the former fighters of the Red Khmer Rouge fell into the ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them have nostalgic memories of the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouges maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unskilled farmers.
"These people have benefited only minimally from surrender," said Sok Leang of the Justice and Reconciliation Centre, led by a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"This Mok used them all."
"But now life is hard because all we have to do for ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Court also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Foreign Minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leader and the people responsible for the crimes, but it was not said that he would continue in the four cases in question.
It was just a bit to calm down the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Red Khmer government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced workers.
The recent steamy evening Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past between the Khmer Rouge.
If the court asked her out, she'd refuse to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and stability," she said.
"If there's another prosecution, there'll be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought further suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre.
"Accommodating in Khmer terms means blinding broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre has issued the first textbook approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties about the Red Khmer.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Red Khmer Rouge, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more difficult and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forum, textbooks and courts are starting to have influence, he said.
The Khmer Reds still have a powerful spell here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains mountains, the road is covered with weeds and sprinkled with plastic bags, which lead to a rectangle of black sasa, covered with rusted sheet roof.
The body of Pol Pota was burned here at a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the place.
"He has a strong spirit, many locals are here praying to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea was born and planned to visit the resting place of Pol Pota, where she will bring a bundle of mature bananas in hopes that it will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it appears to be its stockpiles of uranium-based weapons
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign to provide nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would surrender their resources to highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint declaration issued after the Security Summit of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government tried to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and it seemed that last spring had been struck by a rock of impact.
But American officials said The Washington Post that in the last two months, a few classified operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke under anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, on which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety support group.
Clinton called the deal "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to dispose of all their resources of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's summit on nuclear safety, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our Commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily irradiated, officials announced.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and flights were carried out, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of which are not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons to the Belarusian Research Institute.
"Everything was highly coordinated and controlled on the basis of trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bianjawski, an official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Study this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used to produce weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, seek to remove its stocks by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, especially because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But the Wednesday statement suggests the possibility of gradual twitching.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that the stricter observance of democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its inhabitants," he said.
The Spanish government hasn't done anything with the CIA's precious years.
The Spanish government has not been luxuriant about the CIA flights of the imprisoned Taliban and members of Al-Qaida to Guantánama through Spanish territory, as expressed in his telegram by the United States ambassador to Madrid.
It follows from the documents provided by the Wikileaks daily El País, where it also writes that the then first Deputy Prime Minister, María Teresa Fernándezová de la Vega, requested that the Spanish executiva be informed and "could thus show that it has proper oversight of foreign aircraft flying Spanish airspace".
in June 2006, a meeting between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega was held following a communication from the Council of Europe accusing dozens of States, including Spain, of participating in violations of human rights.
The Deputy Prime Minister said the Council of Europe's message "brought Zapater's government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
"They just want to be informed" in order not to be "obtained unprepared", says Aguirre in one of the documents.
Similarly, then Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos pointed out to the American ambassador that the Spanish government "was to give this matter as low a picture as possible, but with this matter in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as it is concerned, he did not intend to block the initiative of the judge to request the confidentiality of the documents of the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating component or sensitive information," explained the Embassy after interviewing the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concerns rather because of the "extreme coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the deceiving of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly among governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of lunch, US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he already instructed his co-workers to "let them avoid divulging comments with a view to reducing tensions".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - see para.) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that Partido Popular's party will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that Zapater's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if this revelation could have negative consequences for the United States government," it notes.
A confessed mother-slayer complained on a mother's care network.
A young woman spoke of a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog, "Terror in Galicia."
Monica Juanatey Fernández on the Internet calls herself "Muki".
She communicated with her cousin and at least one friend with this nickname, which she has been using since then; the two are from the village of Noia in the area of La Corunë, where the young woman comes from.
Reports are from 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life, which the ABC diary reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30 - year - old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if his baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
She just got a new acquaintance.
Alberto, a young man from the nearby city of Lousame, was her favorite.
Their coexistence took a long time.
Little César lived with them.
When a girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, she stayed with her partner, who even visited Palma for a week.
However, the content of her communication indicates that the relationship has broken down.
She's in Menorca alone in March 2008 and writes, "Alberto's angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, he seemed good, but now he realizes he has to be with a kid all day long and he can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about the text message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address to send you a baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving my little girl with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May they say about their return to their home: "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only going to be late until the 19th, because I have to go to work so that I don't get the place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he will take his son to his home.
"She'll be with whoever she's supposed to be with, then with me, and never in her life will I ever leave him with anyone other than my mother," doubtful intent given her bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When he taps this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month and was likely murdered on the 10th day is already dead.
"César is satisfied on one side, but on the other side he's not."
"He's with me on one side, and he likes it here, but he goes on the other side almost every day to school."
They're talking about moving to Mallorca.
"I'm going to go to summer school, so I'm going to save some money for a nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what e-mail videos, look how he wants it, he's meeting me, sex is needed."
The third report: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one report about Victor, the current partner, "Gives me money."
On the internet are Monica's contributions to blogs dedicated to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now audited, where she used to call herself "The Muki ex-prisoner."
"Teror in Galician (motto)."
The last man with whom she lived, the guardian, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica joined the Palma Provincial Penitentiary yesterday, where she came from the prison center in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant did not remember how everything happened and "that she had no intention of hurting the little one."
But earlier, she admitted that she had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and had put his body in the trunk.
Defence and the D.A. are asking for a psychiatric examination.
Humans would have won 4 chairs and PSC in the House (Socialist Party of Catalan – later) would have lost 9 mandates.
With the results of 28 November, the PP side could have the main word on the councillors in Lérida, Tarragon and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Catalan People's Party - see para.) already has an idea of general elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the national elections is usually one such as those of the Catalan elections.
In 2008, Catalan people obtained 610.473 votes in general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this number was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, PPC (People's Party of Catalan) won 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, supported by the PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that, if general elections were to be held, the PPC could obtain 12 Members in the House compared to the existing 8, the CIU (Convergence and the Union, the Czech Agreement and the Union) would also receive 4 mandates (now having 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 chairs (now has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is essential for PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers Party) parties.
According to this analysis of the human beings, an ERC party (the left-wing Republican Party of Catalans) would lose one Member - now has 3 - while the ICV (the Green Initiative for Catalonian – later) would still have one mandate, or another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest delivery will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the general elections, where also the people who decide on the end of the socialists' domination in the four major provincial cities, as well as on the changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest budget expected - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the council in Barcelona, Tarragon, Lérida and Geronna, where the socialists would not receive the majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV parties.
Given the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in Barcelona's representation - as it is necessary to obtain at least 5% of the votes.
The PP side has increased the number of votes obtained in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragon.
Nationalists believe they could play a major role in the Tarragon coup, where they co-ruled the PP side before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP obtained only 500 votes than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
Humans have also received other important councilors such as Badalona, Castelldeels, and Reus.
Currently, the PP is represented at 34 councillors in Catalan and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan Cell has provided the organization Al-Qaida thousands of passports
In addition to seven detained in Barcelona, another three were detained in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell managed by Thailand, which organised passports for various groups of Al-Qaida, including the "Tygs of liberation of Tamil Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", with the second named group being the author of assassinations in Mumbai, where 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure that the "Operation of Kampai" weakens Al-Qaida's counterfeiting apparatus internationally and "restrict its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that during the two years when the cell was active in Catalonia, it could send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then counterfeited and then delivered to groups that form the criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaida organization, so that their "wars" could travel without punishment across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active cell that had a jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units participated in these investigations besides Thai services, and therefore it cannot be ruled out that there will not be similar interventions in other European countries in the following days, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atthra Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) another development has been developed in Thailand, involving Pakistanans Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the men who were driving a cell from Bangkok based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, the part of which was abolished in 2009, was stealing travel passports for tourists, which met the Islamic requirements.
This means that documents must have belonged to men between the ages of 25 and 45, had to have been valid for several years and be without marked visas.
In the investigation documents, it is pointed out that so far there are no facts that would link the detained Catalans to the assassination in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from the Catalan transfer agency to buy cards in mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People’s Party (PP) requires Mas to stop a fiscal agreement
The president of the PPC (People's Party of Catalan) Alicia Sánchez-Camach had yesterday the opportunity to hand over to Arthur Mas his terms, under which she is willing to support his introduction to the office of President Generalit; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is the recovery of the economy and the rejection of risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the leader of nationalists wants to propose during his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people came to meet with Arthur Mas, with the certainty of 18 seats held in elections last Sunday, which is more than satisfactory for gaining a taste, so the CIU candidate needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his accession to the office.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliance, which the nationalists in the House would like to maintain when the general elections are held, but so far, the talks that are being held in these days by Mas with the rest of the political leaders are being carried out in the Catalan spirit.
As for the president of PP, in order to receive her support for putting into office, "he will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberating speeches", as well as to the economic agreement - similar to that of Basque - about which the leader of the CIU even wanted to vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to reduce the excessive political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce the inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations concerning Masov will be discussed within the framework of the Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat PP.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Kráděd (PSC), who has promised a strong opposition, Joan Herrero (ICV) and today meets with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric operator shall ensure that no "inadequate measures" have occurred due to death.
The appearance of the center of Olot does not exclude that their caretaker killed more than 11 clients
The management of the Geriatric Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to identify the damage caused by the institution of criminal behavior of Joan Vily Dilmé, a caretaker who, in the meantime, was employed here - killed at least 11 seniors who were in custody.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala accompanied the lawyer of the facility, the lawyer Joan Canada, and announced that "the desire of the home of La Caritat would be able to press charges against the vineyard" responsible for the killing, but "law and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to damaging the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not in time revealed the criminal activities of the caretaker, the great threat to the home of La Caritat is now a requirement for material compensation, which is already calculated by legal representatives of the families of the remaining.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight clients of home for seniors suspected that in many cases he had not seen a deceased doctor personally, but that - due to the age and poor condition of patients - everything was done on the phone.
La Caritat, through her director, strongly rejected this extreme, stressing that "the lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened".
The legal representative of La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that, in addition to any third party's own accused, any third party would have any doubts".
A man named now "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 executions yesterday and specified that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and that he killed a second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case caused death by taking too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first time that a mixture of sedative tablets was used.
Director La Caritat pointed out that it is difficult to control staff's access to medical supplies.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were likely in six cases with a nine-fold remedy, which this caretaker used to kill patients in his attempt to relieve them of suffering.
However, the analyses now under way in the laboratory should show whether Vila is lying and actually looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or killing them by serving a bottle, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they don't believe in medical claims, nor do they rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than the number he confessed to, and justify his behavior in the various versions he handed down to the court, knowing that he must change his actions when it turns out that he killed eight people.
That's why they say they want to be available to justice to be illuminated in the whole range of this matter.
The European Central Bank is threatening
Investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat posed by President of the European Central Bank, Trichett, who stressed that "trades should not underestimate our ability to react".
The marginal differentials were closed by force and the shares of the European banks dropped by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the liquid market, which, although falling, recovers - but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It'll take the investor some time before he loses his fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as taking back the liquidity level today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for a fourth in two years.
The Bundesbank requested the end of the recovery plan for non-efficiencies and the elimination of all exceptional liquidity ratios within a period of time and to leave unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity level to predict "minimumly until March" and to comply with the three-month licensing with unlimited access to the end of this trimester in order to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue to continue their bond purchase programme and that they will even announce its intensifying.
If they do not meet the expectations created, they will create a new reaction from the markets yesterday, and if they continue blindly to withdraw the level of liquidity, God will with us!
It was the same at the convention in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, this was announced by the armory on Monday and Wednesday, she announced that she had already bought many of them, causing further market collapse.
Yesterday's bid for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro released only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Therefore, the rates in Portugal decreased by 30 points below, reflecting a change in the mood of the market, which has occurred in the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures were published representing losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent around 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, and they have a chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be resettled.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after stress tests have not revealed the problem in July, the amounts are acceptable in the framework of the supporting plan and will help reduce the uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to get Parliament's approval of the new budget and still lack sufficient support so that uncertainty continues to prevail in Ireland.
Angela Merkel calmed down her tone in order to relieve the tension in the face of the next EU summit meeting on 14 December, at which a political compromise must be reached, which would show that we are a union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others prefer Beethoven Oda for joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action yesterday, which will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficits, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - into investors' ears it sounds like four years from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange rose by 4.5%, double the size of the other European storms.
Unlike February, the response of the government and the National Bank of Spain has been quick and convincing - we seem to be strained by the effect of surprise.
Today, we have a key bond auction for three years, which will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why, we hope, will be a huge demand to help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Requesting a rescue plan would be for Spain to self-sacrifice.
They would give us the cash we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more in March - higher rates and we would have a blue die.
However, it is necessary to continue using the strategy of Cesar's wife - "not to be, but also to appear".
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will challenge Vega Sicily's actions requested by his children
An open conflict in the family of Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, silently.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after being regarded as "very insignificant", the legal action of El Enebro planned for 16 months and the five of its seven descendants who should try to force their majority and take hold of Bodegas Vega Sicily with the help of the administrative authorities of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are in charge of the legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the control of a part of society.
The founder of the largest holding company services does not appear to be willing to fly in his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
five of its seven descendants, who were called ancestors during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January this year, objected to in the Commercial Register, were removed from its Administrative Committee.
The El Enebro trial scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was convened by the official of the Court of Commerce No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the heat in the womb of the Álvarez family.
The appeal before the judge is the only legal means guaranteeing the commission's call to settle the dispute.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the Álvarez Mezquirez considers David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving by means of a court-martial and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the hearings of 18 January, which was totally invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack of this act as "totally insignificant".
Single protagonists, who were discreetly silent, tried without success to summon the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned by Bodegas Vega Sicily alongside other activities, controls seven descendants of David Álvareze 100% capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right of use to 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key issue which the judge will have to decide when to consider the question of a court of appeal. The date of this trial has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula One with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software proposes improvement in real-time vehicles.
Since Red Bull entered the series Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the options of this new incoming team, and despite the rising trend from the recent time, everyone was betting on the Ferrari Fernand Alons triumph.
Without trying to reduce the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, in Formula 1 the legend was born - "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens put into Red Bull's hands to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is an efficient software simulating the marches that the German company placed on the market in 2007 for the purposes of very remote car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in energy plants and for high precision instruments.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenditure.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, the Sukhui aircraft or the most famous utility vehicles of Nissan brand.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this software tool enabled the Red Bull team to perform "in the course of several hours, in almost real time" modification and improvement, which are otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992 they employed on average 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four upgrades during one period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 young highly qualified professionals with an efficient information technology that analyzes and designs every type of vehicle modification.
The manager of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features shall be modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical capability is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull set up about 50 km from London a race of top technology to design and manufacture his racing cars.
These are two buildings, which are restricted to visitors - especially to journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "big secret".
The list of participants includes 580 persons including two pilots - the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is no doubt a fresh champion of Sebastian Vettel in Formula One.
However, other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, do not know them.
Chief of Production Technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was the credit for riders.
currently, this ratio has changed and technology is worth a success from 85%, while pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey recognises that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will establish 20 own shops in collaboration with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with her business partner Pont Reyes opened her first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of the 20 trading networks of 80 to 100 m2 planned by this multinational company in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 already existing business houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Ingles.
The Vice President of Spain, HP Helena Herrerová, cited as an example of a newly renovated shop on Barcelona's Gran Vía, belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has drawn up a plan to set up 200 sales sites in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish trades.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so Barcelona is third.
Herrera did not want to reveal where another store would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrera, who also runs HP's personnel systems, assured that the philosophy of opening business will still be the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with exclusive design the equipment of shops (with products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with the provision of staff for trade.
Helena Herrera denied that it would be a franchising, and stressed that the exclusive network of the shop aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when purchasing, serving, after-sale service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of the pilot pioneer programme at world level, which aims to address any problems with computer devices in the guarantee.
Online service is connected with the Maastricht Technical Centre (Netherlands).
"So we'll be able to solve in 10 minutes problems that may otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is specifically designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service," Helena Herrer said yesterday.
Sabadell bets he'll steal in three years his competitors millions of clients
More optimistic than the other bosses, a delegated member of Banco Sabadell Bank Board, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be difficult for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of a passive war.
However, it is calculated by reducing interest rates, which will, however, seek to compensate for the lowering of bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to be able to get a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with effect for three years.
The aim is, in addition to surviving without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by seizing a million new private clients - respecting 700,000, if those who, if any, leave the bank - as small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses rather than small clients, were forced into the present and the constitution.
This year 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses have already been acquired.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or can also be said to be sober, in order to reduce the cost of which the bank will show the challenges when it presents the results over the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare to set and publish targets, as the financial crisis has changed all plans for global banking.
Sabadell will conclude his programme of Optima four years ago this year, although originally it was for three years, but the situation in the markets required an extension for a further period.
Customers leaving the savings teams will be their main target group.
At a meeting organized by API, Guardian insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
Indeed, it believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be a long way".
In addition, in two or three years 'very difficult to create employment', which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe that passive war - which lowers the margin - is falling, the price of the deductions for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity, is already moving to the credit prices, thus compensating for the reduction of margins.
"The liquidity and financing theme is structural and will represent a push factor for credit."
"We haven't closed the corner yet, but the differentials are very high," Gardiol acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued his network on Thursday's orders to reduce long-term credits and increase differential prices - see CincoDías from November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now lowering commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
The strategic plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as a group it does not exclude corporate operations.
It does not in vain ensure that in Spain "they will demand greater size".
"The next year won't stay on the rock," he assured me.
It confirms that the capital needs are "well reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter between red numbers.
It points out that FROB can complement fund-raising in the market before the new capital measure.
Following the assurance that Sabadell can survive temporary market closures, it continues to pose a serious problem with what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes the next wave of the merger of the sporolene
The CEO of CECA rejected yesterday that further mergers should arise and again insisted on the pace with which the sector is reorganised.
When he began the process of bringing together Spanish collaborators, there were several institutions that ensured that the first phase would not be involved and would wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation, José Antonio Olavarrieta, has ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most mergers have already been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the group Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as the second round, what happens is the conventions."
"Most are fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 constitutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already in place and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which worked very well on this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Chiefs and Executive Officers of the Argon - see para.) Olavarrieta ruled that the process of concentration was "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the instalments, which have not now appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank", he stressed.
"Going out of 45 savings with an average amount of assets of 28.000 million to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that does not have a comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that these are larger and therefore falling in line with the Basel Treaty," he underlined.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of unhappy views on the slowness of the process", which show "the lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to remind us that we must be on a deadline before the end of the year".
The CEO of CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the strictest financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and that those who question it were given "a lack of knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings and the system that managed the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking was very good at the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German lines
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but has set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
The tension in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, through regulation of private mediation agencies, or the cancellation of 426 euros for non-taxed unemployed, to the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spannel Airports and Air Traffic Management - see above), Barajas and El Prat Airport Manager and 30% State Lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felip González, joined the critics at Chancellor Angela Merkel's address because of her responsibility for triggering the current crisis.
How do you interpret this drive?
In advance, it is said that Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redeficit of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is the idea of respecting old traditions, which is held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first represents a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the return to the brand - although it can now appear as a scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to the German proposals for recasting the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary authority, penalties for the guilty states, possible delays of payments for some of them, and the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is now no room for spins.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission initiated deficits in 2009, the German government drew out of its hands a constitutional reform to prevent them from being held since 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (the plans for fiscal tightness and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second showed this Central European country when Merkel was painfully stretching its decision on Greece's rescue.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion that was also published were strongly against Greece's rescue.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel again appeared with a clear view when it called for reform of the European Union's conventions in order to enable the rescue of a Member State and at the same time for private creditors to bear part of the cost.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat relaxed form, has been approved and we should follow the Union reform process in the coming months, which should enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it is not going to cross.
And it tells us all that, although it is now necessary to take measures that are likely to disapprove of them, the old functioning of the euro will be over from this date.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which Member States in breach of the rules will be severely penalised and may be forced to postpone payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany points out that we need to give ourselves a strict way to increase growth by increasing savings and investments, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and construction, with huge balance-of-payment gaps, which over the years have dominated Spain’s growth boom, is simply not tolerable.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not only about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulence will change more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statement (reforms promised after meeting with the big businesses of last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) gives the impression that through criticism at Merkel's address, the idea of putting things in order has opened up.
However, the red line that Germany had pointed out is here, and does not seem to want to move with it.
And the possibilities that can be considered cannot be ruled out by leaving the euro area full of non-serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
The Finty, shown by Alonso and Ramos in the fight with Ajax, show no intention of escaping the punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alons and Sergia Ramose) in the match between the League of Champions against Ajax of 23 November caused the sea to write an ink on whether or not this is a non-sport behavior and, eventually, UEFA should not punish both football players.
As we know, a few minutes before the end of the game (which had their team clearly won) the named players one after the other deliberately lost the time at the moment when the foul was supposed to play to provoke the judge, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending in their group in the lead - and will be able to, get rid of the cards, continue to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Commission awarded Coach José Mourinho a penalty for two games and the guilty players received a fine of money.
The provocation of the yellow card under similar conditions is no new practice, but it is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the football ethos, i.e. rules that are not written but followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was the Real Madrid team (who boasts in his anthem of nobleness and honor, and who has already punished for similar acts his player) and, it seems, also because of the dramaticism led by Mourinh, which thus adds to his long history the comedian and the proponent of another episode.
in any case, the debate is about whether this type of act, which is not strictly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these acts are circumvented by law; it is indeed an action respecting sports rules, the meaning of which, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
It deals with the type of harm that such conduct can cause to a sports spirit.
One aspect of sports behavior is the physical intrusivity of opponents who have not been violated in these cases, or have not been forced to play.
Another of these features of a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage against the team of opponents - which has not occurred here either.
So paradoxical at the action of Real Madrid's players is the fact that there has not been what we normally characterise as a scaffolding or circumvention of the law, there has been no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should have been as evident as possible in order to obtain the penalty.
They waited and liked to get the punishment.
However, another question is what benefits will be gained from their deliberate wrongdoing.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position and that there is no benefit in the current match, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy until the next game, because the club won't be able to count with these players.
The advantage is obviously that players will begin another phase of the League of Masters without cards, which could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, it is an advantage of a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first sight the team can be eliminated, and, in addition, it will be punished by the players, and they will cross over to the second round of cards, in which one card less than the first round is sufficient to be excluded.
So, as the wheels continue, it won't be quite clear if it's an advantage.
In short, and well, these negotiations are not against the sports spirit, which is part of a strategic decision that will make it possible to get the maximum benefit under the rules.
in the case that we are dealing with here, players did not have the aim of avoiding the award of a penalty (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather chose when to subject themselves to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or fleeing the punishment.
Although it is not clear that the border between the doctrinal and the circumvention of the rules is not clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a doctrinal.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and the way the transfer of instructions to provoke them from leadership.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Fighting offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictatorship concentrates this year avalanche reservations on December 16th and 17th.
There are fast celebrations by the employees themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the arrival of December they come again to pre-war parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but due to the crisis they have led to a reduction in prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, they match the business and association polls from this sector.
In order to complete the complication of the numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas day fell on Friday) of the request for a week from 13 December, creating an avalanche of reservations for days in peak (16 and 17), while in the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has been the case since 2008, when the thin years began, there are many companies that have been cancelling collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon tradition, many employees pay spending on parties from their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand the prices at the border of kidnapping, says the president of the Gremi de Restaurants Association de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of restaurant facilities is not currently considering what the celebrations of this month will be.
"People will think it through before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but as far as the price topic is concerned, they're careful," he adds.
Trades will go well for those "who will offer quality and good service at a favourable price", he says and reminds that due to the crisis customers tend to go down and most customers want to spend around EUR 25 now.
Research in various facilities shows that the greatest challenge to booking requests is at the evening of 17 December.
The Soteras Group announces a real boom booking for this Friday, with the most requirements for losses up to EUR 30, allowing the menu offered, the total prices of which are between EUR 25 and 30.
in another major company, Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the speciality of this year's calendar of more early reservations since the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, each of which should be chosen, move from 19.95 to 30 euros," they state.
In the AN Group Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQ and the total number of 23 companies, the group remains optimistic after having recorded an increase in profits since the second half of the year and has relatively solid prospects for Christmas marketing.
The sources of this company stress that the 18th of December will also be a difficult day, as it will be a pre-war celebration between friends.
to their six group menu they added a menu for Christmas, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded the trend of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as coffee (Spanish sparkling wine - see above).
They also noted that companies are already emerging that once again call their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
The vice-president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and the Center of Free Time in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "renewed", although clients "agree on maximum".
Even during Christmas celebrations, he did not give up, let him pay, and let him show.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused great unrest in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "at a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs published by the Wikileaks portal confirms the extraordinary unrest in Washington, which is fuelled by Pakistan's nuclear programme.
In addition to clarifying and significant details that they offer regarding the content of communication and the ideas of North American diplomats in Islam, they reveal these documents that cooperation between the two states, in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "is in retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The speciality of Pakistan's nuclear program - that his weapons are not assembled, but are consistent in the works to make their destruction more difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in a report before visiting James Jones' national security adviser: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, the alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and with the programme of controlled missiles is no longer seen only by the US, but also by Russia, as a spreading and constituting reason to be vigilant.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or programmes of controlled missiles," said expert Jurij Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their US counterparts.
The biggest news of documentation published by Julian Assange's server is the growing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and on the pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Despair issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies to communicate with Pakistan as "frustating", says: "Transparence often does not exist; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "and despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington that during his visit to the army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, "very well explained" that "the Pakistani army must end with the silent support of terrorist groups".
Hoon to Chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking worker responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to track and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth, where it's hard to be certain of the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday's "emergency challenge", the so-called order notice, to "localize and monitor the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates back to 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of over a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse against which Australia is facing in Sweden.
In addition, he assures the legal representative of Wikileaks Mark Stephens that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was 20 November when the International Police Committee, based in French Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions on the identification or localisation of Assange 'in order to bring temporary ties on it and issue them".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of the person concerned by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, but consider the so-called order of notice to be a means of arrest - this must be ensured by the national police component - especially if the States have a bilateral agreement on extradition of detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be located.
This step worsened Assenge's lawyers, who yesterday published writings, where they declared that the nine-year-old founder Wikileaks was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities using videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the legendary Lavrentius Pavlovič Berija, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a chase and not legal persecution," says a letter.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, however, does not remain silent.
On Monday, he provided an interview with Skype from an unknown interview with Time magazine editor - in this interview he demanded a demise from the U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering US diplomats to carry out espionage at the UN and thus violate the international conventions signed by the United States, she should withdraw," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for demis as "smary and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual running the website," he said for CNN.
Obama himself assigned a highly-built counter-terrorism officer, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding importance to Assang contrasts with the views that these days have overshadowed conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber since January, asked the Foreign Ministry to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organisations, "to be able to intervene and prosecute anyone who financially contributed or otherwise provided assistance".
Even further came Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's advisor, who declared that Assange should "be killed", which he then had to call back.
"Bobs should write a reward for him or use a drone or something like that."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckbee, Baptist priest, former Governor of Arkansas, and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever will be in government, who is responsible for leaking information, is betrayed and any punishment other than execution would be too mild," Fox said at the station
Puigcercos is looking for peace in the ERC to "snore" on the followers of Cardode
The Republican leader shall allow the secret vote on his/her election.
Huguet is proposing more plural execution and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found a recipe to fight several of the internal revolutions in the ranks of the ERC (the left-wing Republic Party of Cataláns – see above), unfavorably due to the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his demise gesture seems insufficient to the former leader Josep Lluís Carodo-Rovira, and also knows that the impact of this sector is now as weakened as his leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot cause him to worry as much as he had with other dead streams.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to get new criticisms by snooping to help him turn to the general elections.
First of all, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee would be able to speak in secret for his term of office.
With ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the president is to be given a criminal vote, he will be able to do so without fear of retaliatory measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the breakdown and subjugation of his own person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he did not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one additional, but added without specifying the percentage that would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
The followers of Carod demand more from the President than to give their function available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercos rules the largest body at the conventions.
But given that they do not have sufficient majority to force the demise, they will try to resemble the plan from now until May.
For this reason, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategy reorientation document, which will be voted by the National Council on 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to move Congress already in autumn 2011.
The ERC leader stated that "very loudness" harms stability, and that his goal is that the organization will be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
in this context there seems to be a significant article that current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking in the mind of Puigcercos's ideologist, this innovation adviser took on a finished matter that the leader would be confirmed by a "change for several purposes".
And he named five of them, two of which stand out.
The first is a "composing" exercise to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means to include new faces that are from the sector inclined to carod.
The second goal can be great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC completely terminate the meeting as a mechanism of operation.
He therefore fights for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates selected by vote.
The completion of the meeting system model, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended objective of the Puigcercos team, which has fought in this direction at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 Conciliation decided that the meeting must be considered at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has alienated itself from the solution of the matter.
Now, without moving critical sectors, it could be a good time to re-examine this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico has seen a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, as reported by MILENIO.
There are three women killings and a couple of separate bodies found in the Valley of Mexico.
in the last month of the year, they are experiencing a total of 390 deaths in Mexico, probably related to organised crime.
Cases include the finding of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, Toluca district.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, further wound from grace to the head, and had his hands and feet tied with rope.
The next day a body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early on Thursday, November 4, the team discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshots to the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the section of Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50 - year - old man was murdered in Nezahuallóyotl, after leaving his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7th, two victims were killed in the head at the age of 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony in the Ecatepec district.
In Chalco, a dead body of a man shot at the head was found on a remote road in the El Naranjo colony, and under the body was found a bullet casing from a .25 caliber weapon.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the waste water channel in the Playa Golondrina colony.
Rescue files have done a thorough search of other parts of it, but they have not found them.
The inhabitants of Tepotzutlán reported finding the body with their hands tied in the back and twisted head at the site of Pen Colorada.
The man had a gunshot wound to his back.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were packed in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, and reports of death were also found in the victims.
A day later, she was found in the colony Valle de los Reyes in Los Reyes La Paz, a cardboard box containing a human head.
a nearby colony found the rest of the body wrapped in a black plastic bag with a report from El Incorregible.
On the 17th were found two dead women wrapped in bed linen in the settlement Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan was found killed by a man wrapped in a yellow sheet, who was previously identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report left by the killers in his body.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no sign of life with two wounds to the back was found in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla.
A tattoo of Santa Muerte's sacred figure was found on the woman's skin (literally, "Holy Death") as well as necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a corpse of a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their head wrapped in tape were found and there was also a report in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
With the victims, the report was probably written one of the criminal organizations that said, "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
two bodies were found in Ecatepec, which carried marks after torture and had tied limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the Centre Justice in the colony of San Agustín.
The last day of the month was found the remains of two men in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first one was stung and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was packed in black plastic bags tied with a tape and kept a message; while the second one was beaten and found in plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Agents and a message card were found with him.
China respects its objective to reduce greenhouse gases
At the UN Conference on Climate Change COP16, the representative of this country assured that his country had made an extraordinary effort to reduce its carbon footprint and specified that it insisted on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the country's representative at the UN Conference on Climate Change.
In his first public address at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million over the past four years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he noted that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He recommended that the Chinese climate change strategy be divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been made, including the approval last year of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He further stressed that in China the federal authorities had cooperated in coordination with the provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives with regard to energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he has reported, various multi-annual plans have been in progress or have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, it is, as he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the last five years, which has received investments from the UN, governments and private initiatives.
Also running the provincial project on climate change, the project on the exchange of light bulbs for saving light bulbs, and the project on mitigation and adaptation, he specified.
At the same table Martin Krol, an expert adviser to this country for climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than they generally thought.
For example, he calculated that greenhouse gas emissions per capita are 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
Also, unprecedented efforts have been made with regard to energy use - e.g., increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects further progress to be made by 2020, he added.
Entitled Exclusion Espin: César Nava
The National President of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party, see para.) stated that the former Chairman of this Party is entitled to apply for his right to the National Order Commission.
The National President of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientose has been prohibited and that the former Chairman of this Party is entitled to address the National Committee of Order and to demand his rights.
In an interview, which was delivered before the objection was raised by the Governor of the State, Gabin Cué Montegud, he said that the expulsion of Espin is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"It is the Autonomous Decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Committee of the National Council in his case in order to make a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that it was never at the negotiating table for the presidency of the alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN would come out of the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, will be strengthened.
"This (the 2012 alliance) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, was the intention for local elections, which was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he noted.
The president of the PA said that 71 years of dialogue was behind him, and therefore "we are not cured by internal competition, but we are making it harder and stronger," he added.
He said that the committee could elect the best president or president, who for the next three years is worthy of PAN, without any debate, so he would hand over the staff to what "the committee will appoint".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, to any of those five proudly hand over the office of the President of the Party."
He predicted that the rise that the party recorded in the last elections of July would be reflected in future clans, although "there is no time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, which have roots in the alliances in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe, would represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, since "many expectations and actions are put into them, and I am sure that Gabino will meet these expectations".
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI party (Partido Revolutionario Institution, Czech Revolutionary Institution Party, see cross)) for his statements within four years, César Nava called on members of the PRI to think about the six-year periods of former President Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the governments of Zedilla and Salinas think that they were better than the rule of Fox and Claderon, let them defend them, let them come out of their hives," he testified.
He stated that the head of federal executive power had the right to express himself as he had done during the National Auditorium, since there was no gauze or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes a law on Twitter to support undocumented students
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to approve this law," the American president tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama has now joined national mobilisation in support of the Dream Act by contributing to his personal account of the social network Twitter, which should legalise students without documents.
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to approve," Obama tweeted.
His short report draws attention to the internet link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to connect immediately with the senators, as the vote on this law is approaching.
"As the vote is expected to take place soon, it is now time to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block any legislation unless the increase in tax reductions from the Bush era and government funding were approved.
Such blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential speaker said he believed that once a fiscal theme was resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be drawn up.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax matter before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we can reach an agreement in this matter and then we will be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the House of Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would request a "vote on the conclusion of the debate" on the Dream Act law, so the motion for legalization of undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
Senatorial approval Dream Act, or "American Dream" law, would legalize about 800,000 young people who reached the United States 16 years ago, lived in the country for the last five years and have been admitted to higher education or military institutions.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve, so that they need the assistance of several Republicans, so that the organisations of their supporters carry out intensive agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
Democrats, whose most Dream Act supports, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the proponents of the Dream Act need to obtain several republicans in case other Democrats choose to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the followers mostly negotiate with are the senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator from Florida, George Lemieux, who has supplemented Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they said they will no longer support it.
Another Republican, who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the House of Representatives adheres to another version, most analysts say Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature insert finger into the wound ("Poner el dedo en la lla", translated "put finger into the wound" is the same as the Czech "to hit nail on the head - late.
The second round of the language pleasure cycle was a promenade where the participants presented the literary gala
"I understand this with Sex in the language, but... Ring in the morning? What is expected of me?" writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Delight in the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (on another round table they dedicated themselves to the subject Sex in the language, explained).
The ring "brings us into narrow places" was delivered by the Argentine writer to an audience composed mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajar to hear this debate at the round table, the fashionable Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramíreze, Mayry Monterová and Luis García Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read a text dedicated to Gonzalu Celori, which Schultz later referred to as a great story in which Luis in the first person performed as a protagonist who, when searching for knowledge, goes from a doctor to a doctor, from whom she cannot answer, even though the same story has been traced to her.
From an infectologist, she's convinced that patience isn't my strength, maybe it's my wound.
Finally, after a frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road but explained that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst who will reveal the secret: "the wound represents it really open and the scar is symbolic."
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "the wound was only enough to learn that it is really open and that it does not exist", but it was convinced that the pleasure and the attacks in the language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel played both.
In addition, Sergio Ramírez performed with a delightful story called Praise to the Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but appears at one time.
With the elements of magical reality, he tells of a famous witch who played the clouds, brought back the people who had gone far, or fixed the honor that one virgin lost, this story, which then turned around to speak to America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers who had told him were not lacking, and here was quoted by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the overreach in telling the conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, mocked the fake testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in other ways, he never managed to tell the story of America with a kind of imagery that even the cold lacked."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have a bigger fantasy" and right where reality and a lie have come to light, where the story is no longer known to belong to one group and, secondly, to reach the fictional literature of its peak.
That's what it calls a "Cervan tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter stressed and praised the diversity of interpretations invited by the International Book Fair with her word finger in the morning.
A Cuban-portorist writer showed with her finger the great morning of social violence that goes through her country - and she is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs make a quiet compromise, which, of course, is not intended," she said after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that arises between the author and the readers - and their "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero concluded, whose performance also placed the emphasis "on this finger in the morning of the writer's commitment to the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and the control of consciousness, which overwhelms dogmatism, he forgets that "there is a small no hiding behind every touch, and there is also a small yes behind every denial."
"In order to be masters of our thoughts and reality, we must paint: and paint means many times putting our finger into the wound and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also harassing the authority that prefers this black and white world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano follows his first title
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the finals, experienced good and bad during his career, but he has already achieved three opportunities for a decisive series.
in the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the finals, two different styles will be met with their techniques, teams that have a clear difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the finals, suffered both good and bad during his career, but was able to achieve at three occasions on a decisive series, but to now he left with an unmanaged one, and that is why this chance for him is extraordinary.
Argentina must have satisfied himself with the silver medal, remained one step behind the winner and played with the same team following the finals.
As a coach, the Santist Stratég got to his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament, when he held the burden of the Morelia club, with which he fell overall 4-2 against Toluce; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament he again went to a decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Laguna club in the Tour Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Devils" from Toluka, Rubén again suffered the defeat, although his team played against the "Uzenárs" (a further nickname of the Club Deportivo Toluca - later over.) After 210 minutes of the game undecidably 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he got the advantage of three to one and had two chance to seal the title, but eventually his three players passed 11 steps and so the team suffered a turn on 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and he could for the first time celebrate the title, although he says he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm committed to, and the title would of course be for me, but the first one is the most important," the coach said when he was asked about the numbers he was talking about in the finals against him.
In living memory has a previous final, in which, as it confirms, many have learned, "we learned that until the referee closes, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as the players, because last with two penalts, we were already ready to run to celebrate, and I think that in this we have learned, until the match is over, we cannot celebrate."
He is not concerned that this series could decide in criminal shootings, he believes his players: "Unless you are trying to reach a series of criminal kicks, you are trying to end up in normal times, but sometimes there is no other option, and we have to be ready for it, we have been prepared in the last tournament, unfortunately we have a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, and we have left something behind, and we hope that this time there will be no such thing."
Romano has a chance in her hand to stop being the other and to taste the glory they bring for the first time.
United States changes visa allocation rules
People will have to turn to the Visa Service Centres before they interview the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
Since 10 January 2011, the process of negotiating visas for the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to turn to the Centres of the Visa Application Service (shortening from the English language ASC) before the interview at the Consular Department.
Staff from ASC will receive biometric information from the applicant and will be evaluated by the Consular Department prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of issuing a visa will be lower, no longer necessary to pay the meeting fee, the second to process the application and the other to deliver the transport service document.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including temporary workers visas) and $390 for a business and investor visa.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular official, but only turn to the nearest ASC where they submit their documents and get their fingerprints.
Given that biometric information will be collected in ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee of $26.

NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency called a press conference tomorrow to present an discovery that could cause a breakdown in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock by experts in astrobiology, science that deals with study of origin, evolution, spread and the future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When NASA invited journalists, it assured NASA that it would present a "discretion that would cause a breakdown in the search for extraterrestrial life", which sparked speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures other than us living in unhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and that could represent the possibility that one of them will become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
The image somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the probability that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere like that on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenics in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second form of life, different from what we know".
The Space Agency will announce the actual range of discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference is attended by Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron bear the opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", declared.
The 60th Parliamentary Period has not yet begun, when an opposition bloc was established in Congress, led by the MPs of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democratica, Czech "Page of Democratic Revolution"—later.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Partido del Trabajo"—later.), Convergencia (Czech "Agreement"—lat.) and Jesúsem Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" in the House.
Before the start of the 60th Parliamentary Period Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patron Montalvo "grained" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, since they are excommunicated.
This reform, they repeated, begins "bapartism" because it will now be two people from the same number of parties that will govern Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, coordinator of the PRD side, were the only Members who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brita by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" – see above) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms are institutionally a political marginality of the PRI side (Partido Revolutionario Institution, Czech "Revolutionary Institution") and PAN.
He explained that during the coming days they would speak to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they will again be subject to these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
"When the opposition coalition came here, so I look at it, because we are excluded from any decision, they are not even willing to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence stated that they are compatible with the PRD, PT and Patron and will therefore form a plurality group.
It's impossible to allow, to keep Congress from being monopolistic, now "dupole".
The law's aspirations to reform are not that there is an endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
According to PT, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained that the Congress has now become a "beast" of two - in an attack on PAN and PRI.
"It was once controlled by only one side, today it is divided by two."
Patron Montalvo asked for respect for the Member's personality to be given a seat at the table.
"For the five Members who will probably be nine, but right now, they see us at five, they don't stay because of the jeweled agreements outside, everyone in another faction, we are united to find a place at the table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed to, we stand outside, and we disagree with this reform."
Another 200,000 pesos are issued for "the supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another check to the owner of the company supplying electrical material.
Another check for a little over 200,000 pesos was sent to the council by Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This sum paid in the second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial will be raised to 1.200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last check number 925447 was sent on 16 November of this year, was displayed on the volume of 200,144,56 pesos and was referred to as "comparation of outstanding payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme Audit Office for sales at high prices, another volume.
What has not been said is the total amount that the council still owes to her, and how many checks will be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe her, as well as to other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks appeared "against" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this firm has not yet been published in the Official Journal, according to the law in the case of companies audited by the Supreme Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the Treasury assured that it had not used the services of the City Hall supplier again.
In the past, after July 25th, Noroeste published a review of checks issued by the advisers to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camachová Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checkes.
It also carried out a transaction with Jumapam, where it collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about a foreign tourist accident due to the bad condition of the Sánchez Tabood in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in depth at the Sánchez Taboods station, the authorities ask for a tourist sector in Mazatlán to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and thus do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Commercials Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked to care for the impression of the destination, and the bad that tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk through here and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Police don't know what it's like to close a business for one day, and they have no idea about the markets that they're avoiding, otherwise they wouldn't be dealing with these issues for that long and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist crash caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The board will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, it will have to deal with preventive maintenance, not only correct existing failures," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, we should be doing maintenance, even as residents we deserve a clean home, the town hall should change its strategy of maintaining the city".
There are other places that look neglected and poor, noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito (monument, the statue of deer - see over.).
"Today, in order for tourists to arrive, it is not only about promotion, it is important to offer a good product, i.e. a city that is clean with its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no need for attention here, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to all, maintenance is missing.
He spoke of a number of places that need to be arranged in cooperation with the councillor, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, subtitarian Tourist Promotion, said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural objectives and space, which, however, will need to be set in order first to make these places more attractive and so that we can include them in the list that we have to promote this destination".
IP asks for results after Congress
Eduardo Davalos, President of CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by setting an example in finding better Sinaloy in the various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary period full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State executive requires the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is throwing up in spasms and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th Parliamentary Period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 from PA, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and the last from PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations of the new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments towards society and the various areas that require responsible legislative work and that there will be no repetition of the same side and Paternistic patrons.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, Chairman of the Co-ordinating Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress should take great responsibility and be an example on the road to better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become the carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He therefore talked about the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary locking that would move the governing forward by order.
"We want them to do a decent job, and they are primarily committed to society and sectors, because they were the people of Sinaloy who gave them their voice in previous choices of trust."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to gather all the forces in an effort to achieve the economic growth of the country, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth in order to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in a certain way."
With regard to tourism, he asked the new legislators to give him greater weight within the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate because it is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which is also directly competing with agriculture."
In addition to spending funds on start-up tourist projects, Congress should help provide the state with certainty and help with an alcohol law that has failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
They're looking for the Three Kings.
The dolls, the cars and the bicycles are together with other toys on the list of children's wishes in the family of the Coronado Valenzuels.
For their parents, it will be difficult for the three kings to fulfill their imaginations at the coming Festival, since their home is read by exactly 12 people and one brother.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes that they so long for.
The family lives in a humble residence in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions because the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes we're having a hard time because our husband's unlucky, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes...
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As far as José Alfred's 10-year-old is concerned, he'd like a monster car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesús, Cayetana would like a one-year-old dress.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I'd wish for this monster car, but I said 'We'll see him, son' because it was very expensive," recalls Cayatan's sorrow.
For the older kids who were just at school, there would be perfect clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, has a size 12, a 10-year-old Isaacs size 10, while Miguel, eight-year-old, wears size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan misses his sneakers, so he'd be very good at a couple of sizes five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the family of the Coronada Valenzuel, you can participate in the campaign "Looking for the Three Kings", and at the reception of the journal Nooeste bring a gift or money in cash.
14 alleged drug dealers arrested
Ten inspections were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people were arrested and faced with various charges.
Tours took place in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
"Approximately 750 Indian hemp stalks, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that served to produce were confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the police in Quebek.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, both of which were alleged to be chiefs of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Arrested persons had to enter the Justice Palace in Sherbrooke after their arrest.
They could face charges of production of Indian hemp, his possession for the purpose of trading with him, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These visits followed a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that enabled us to proceed with these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Department of the City of Estrie State Police of Quebec, the State Police of Sherbrooke and the Police Administration of Sherbrooke Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problem.
The proposal for a law of conservatives who, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships imposed by illegal immigrants, will clearly be overpowered, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
"I depend on Charter for a significant measure."
"I stand on the right side of the side which has built a granite under your feet," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after a weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the draft law, as proposed, is a law that would allow for the retention of up to one year of any person originating from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Chief of the quebecké block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he was heading for the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said M. Duceppe.
The NPD critic on immigration issues, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticisms that they wanted her party not to be strong enough with regard to illegal immigrants.
"Neo-democrats agree to take measures against illegal immigrants' leaders, and that is what we consider to be a part of another draft law, C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill of conservatives because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year," Mrs Chow explained.
The immigration minister, Jason Kenny, accused the opposition.
"The Canadians collectively tell Members that they do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations that Canada is taking on a fly and treats it like a parrot."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures to respond to Minister Kenny.
The government did not vote on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
A Conservative also told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that any Member against it would respond from his stand before his vote.
New Unity Does Not Mean Unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to require the establishment of a public investigation committee for the issue.
Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil seeks this idea not to fall into oblivion: Québec intends to consult the Department of Investigation of New York in January next year.
Metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit available since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised us.
It should be noted that, at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, it was not necessary for the public security critic, PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to evaluate this announcement as "a queen pulled out of a hat" and "amateur solutions fucked on her knees".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who feared that political power had too much effect on the possible future of unity.
"He'll be happy with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting up of a witness hearing in a public hearing.
"In addition, Mr Charest argues that he doesn't want to create this investigation committee, and people think, just like you and me, he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the establishment of an investigation commission is the demision of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science in the Institute for the Education of Senior Officials.
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposed to Quebek to give a special mandate to the Inspector-General to investigate collages and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
It also considers that Quebec could give the Inspector the same powers as the Commissioners, who are allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the files of the Charest Government.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code so that it is better suited for this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would come from Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister of Public Security Vic Toews has confirmed that his judicial colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this file.
During Operation Jaro 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Ganging Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several watercourses have been under strict control due to severe precipitations that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
There was a land collapse on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated preventively.
In the evening, there was another land collapse in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road's swerved.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions hit a heavy rainfall, i.e. between 40 and 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 additional millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The stretches in the north of the river and in the valley of Outaouais were hit the most.
A total of up to 100 millimeters could fall.
If we calculate these precipitations by melting the snow accumulated in certain sectors, we can fear floodwaters in some water streams.
The Quebeku Rescue Service issued a warning Wednesday night about the danger of flood for the Auareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the woods of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood alerts and uninterrupted checks.
In the area of de Lanaudière caused severe decompositions of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelle-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a surveillance bridge was severed as a result of the heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated preventively.
In the Outtaaouais, spilling some lakes from the shores resulted in the closure of some roads, especially in the towns of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service has an emergency and is looking after the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
Quebec flood forecasting centre issued warnings against strong floods for several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assomption, Auareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blemished
Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements concerning social assistance and Haitians and, as well as gross expression during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI group 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "inaccurable information on social assistance and inadequate negative identification of Haitians with gross expression that does not correspond to the transmission to the broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, including the transmission of the names of both persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules for radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting and Television Board received a number of complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Quebek Social Aid recipients.
The group complained that the amounts referred to in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the broadcast of the "Dupont South reports" have stumbled on a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
No bulge was raised against him.
The last dispute concerned a statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort then took the media shoot, which caused many reactions.
Commander CHOI has declared that he has not sent any gift to help the Haitians because we cannot be sure that the needed money will indeed be given.
The Commission considers that these comments were not illegal, but that their cumulative effect creates an improper negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already canceled my three-day postponement of this thing."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in transmission.
Anyway, the CHOI-FM radio broadcasts have collaborated "over the limits of their responsibilities".
For the station, which will have to announce this decision once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung fuvà Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special experience.
Atlet, which excels in "Sanda" (Kung-fu "full contact"), enters the kickbox and Thai box into the tattoos and ringes of the world and seeks new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for games all over the place because for those who don't like the game on earth that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, just gave his opponents bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the kickbox category full contact and the Thai box, said."
"At present, I'm preparing for the San Shoo World Cup in China."
"They were invited by the rivals who finished the first four at the last World Cup in each category."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won the bronze."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up in eighth."
"In 2007 in China I finished the fifth morning tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third, added."
"It's interesting that in every competition I've made some progress."
"I'll be the first one this year or so!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where the fists and feet are struck, as well as throwing to the ground, allowed.
The games are traditionally played on the platform and rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As much as Nacer Zemmal has to keep in his career only one result, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a nice guy."
"It's kind of equivalent to Stade Lupinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before he suffered the loss in the finals.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four rivals in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will meet so that a single champion, king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 contracted million without public competition
Hydro-Quebec agreed, after mutual agreement, 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this avalanche over 100 contracts, it is the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which received the most significant contract, a project management contract totalling $295 million without a public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the Énergie gérance, was authorised in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Quebec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Energie gérance" consortium acquired a lucrative contract without any public competition announcement.
For Quebec, a complaint on a consortium of businesses is a serious ethical problem in front of us, which risks the exclusion of competition and causes price increases..
"It's a new way to realize the illusion and eliminate competition."
"This means that people, outside agreements, are no longer secret; today they are already making them openly," said MP PQ Sylvain Simard at the press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to bear how public interest could be sold like this.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon to deny that this contract would go on a loophole.
"I have my own way," she thundered and claimed that PQ was "unhonorable" and "wanted accuracy".
She said that "that would be the smallest" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually an alliance, limited in time, which allows two or more companies to group their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the call for proposals for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex given the scope of the work.
The building is already in operation and has to be deployed by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without competition; it was a trade.
It must also be acknowledged that the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, a consortium formula in the field of engineering consulting is under investigation in the government.
If we fly over at the speed of business registers of Quebec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's name CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular the fact that "the land of La Baie James is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Quebec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), provided an explanation that will make us wreak havoc over the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to the public competition and if there are few contestants offering offers, your bids may be higher."
"You have a choice of two options: that you're going to take the people who act as contestants in the contract, and that you're going to say, "Let's make a satisfactory and good deal."
"But the main idea is that it is not the price, it is the competences of the people," said Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebeku Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir calculated 109 consulting contracts in the field of engineering concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories conducting soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin collected 22 contracts, from which Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in the "Energy gérance".
All contracts were closed.
The quota read $449,783,344, including the contract with Énergie gérance on $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "very well known the Liberal side of Quebeku".
Minister Normandeau issued a report that PQ is also associated with companies that "finance it" before she specified that it was more of a management company.
Barometer responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire trust
More green, but openly skeptic.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in the "unbias" labels and environmental certification, to be guided accordingly in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that while we are bathing in the media universe, which urges us to be more socially responsible, this media universe laments the lack of reliable information, the failure to fulfil obligations that even qualify as a brake for its commitment, says Baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption has increased in 2010 so-called socially responsible products, the people of Quebec, who try to sell them, still do not trust them too much.
Two-thirds of us actually say that they don't trust the promises of environmental companies simply because the green advertising of companies is finding the measuring tool developed by the Observatory for Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the authenticity of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands identified as ecologically responsible, mentions Barometers.
In the same way, the debate on this subject is taken as a serious 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
Information on responsible consumption seems, however, to be the first to stimulate this site's recovery consumption at present almost a third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, a vacuum and doubtful nature of information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Baromètre identified at a higher price for these products.
Finally, a third of the population of Quebekuse is building distrust against the reported product or green services that we are looking for to let them pass by our hands.
On the other hand, almost half of the consumers in 2010 were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
All 61% of them preferred shopping from their quarters and preferred buying food produced in their region, Baromètre says.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québeku likes to present himself as king of recycling, which seeks the slightest environmental impact by caring for animal protection.
But their social and environmental consciences apparently remained somewhere outside their vehicle, says Baromètre: in 2010, hardly 28% of the population of Quebec stated that they were using public transport or recommend the use of a car to drive at least two persons, in order to protect nature.
The walk and round also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan to purchase a set of eXcentris cinemas
The government of Quebek, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the cinemas eXcentris Company Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the loan.
Angus et le Parallèle, a developer company who sought a gift of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to purchase a cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and who demonstrated her mission as a lover of film art, did not get what she demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the government of Quebeku proposes a loan that would ultimately be lower, some original expectations that could form the basis for a viable solution under favourable conditions and with resources from the State.
The first action plan and the requirement of 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebek last spring, but requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and action plan were sent to the Minister of St-Pierre by the President to the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the eXcentris cinema project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December time to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Let us recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebek has opposed the direct investment of the state in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture should not finance a project relating to properties when he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the discussion demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, owner, got into the space of his cinemas within ten years of film art after financing the construction of the complex himself, which could have been a reason for the change on the part of the State's Financial Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shrieking in Montréal, and eXcentris could get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his command, is running a private sector fund-raising campaign in the belief that he will spend $700,000 on pushing the acquisition.
Since spring 2009 one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27th of next year and present the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remind Le Devoir and so ignores him, he and his group are thinking about the suggestions for the reduction that they've made to him.
A raised curtain to Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American springs, known through WikiLeaks, reveal what the United States considers to be a complex minority of Canadians towards Americans, but also as a blow, they express their sense of superiority toward Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian vote has the heart of Canadian-American relations when they go to vote, and believe that the visit of President Obama helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new news reports between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, released yesterday on public dissension, provide additional sensitive details to enable them to get under each other's skin.
On 22 September 2008, the Communication, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great admiration of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian Minority Complex, almost stuck, mentions maybe political leaders to talk about internal bets instead of realizing that these elections concern the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), " he writes.
"So the United States are," he concluded, "by a proverbial elephant in these elections: everywhere, but potentially too threatening to talk about them."
The ambassador means this "major silence" less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party or even better head of a party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your path will help ensure that the government retains confidence in the vote at the beginning of February on the federal budget, to which Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a $30-40 billion recovery plan," writes M. Brees.
There was no mention that the Government had to postpone the Parliament's pre-war session, so that it could not be defeated by a coalition and that the opposition parties mentioned their survival with the quality of the proposed reconstruction plan.
Another report of January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins draws Washington's attention to the increasingly negative picture that the United States is throwing dramatic series on CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too sensitive references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or kidnappings for violent CIA interrogations can be observed.
Another report reports that during their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked his French partner, Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe is ready to accept some of the prisoners from Guantanamos.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but based on the principle of "case of case".
At the end of the meeting, it says here, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, state secrets."
"The secretary accepted with her revision of the file."
Finally, let us note that the persons concerned by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, declared on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "broken".
Mike Huckbee, in the United States, heard about it.
World Light Restoration Plan
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancún a plan for the restoration of home lighting, the lighting of shops and industrial space in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction in the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional restrictions to be achieved for the stability of the planet's climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is located at the stage of the major concrete projects that the UN wants to launch in Cancún to compensate for the lack of difficult implementation commitments to reduce on the part of the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if heated bulbs monopolized by 50 to 70% of the market are replaced by fluo-compact or, even better, by bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial quantity of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet caused by lighting would be broken down.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the car park on the entire planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, have been involved in voluntary reduction plans that should allow for a fall in global GES emissions from 53 Gts to 49 Gts.
But it will have to be subtracted from this balance for 5 Gts to be achieved by 2020 to stabilise climate warming at 2° Celsia so that it can be ruled out that it does not get out of control.
In hot bulbs, 95% of energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluo-compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs will last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
New bulbs with DEL, wafers that put Philips into production this week - this company allegedly participated in the UN study - have an estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the hot bulb, which gives us an idea of a possible savings with a compensation plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with reostates and light less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations to fluo-compact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be treated as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, but manufacturers would have set up a collection site.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-compact bulb, but rather heat-fired coal plants, which emit many mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centers put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation each year.
The report also details the benefits that each country would have made of this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 heat plants, whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
Côte d'Ivoire eagerly expects the results of the elections.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadline set.
"The Secretary-General emphasises the need for the Independent Election Commission to complete its work and immediately announce the preliminary results, stressed the UN President's spokesman."
"He asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiatives until the notification of the supervisory results."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the election committee had the latest date – the middle of the night - without disclosing the results, three days after Sunday's collapse.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, President CEI confirmed on TV that the Commission "progresses at work" in order to report the results.
In the middle of the world , the challenges have multiplied in order for the CEI to finally declare the name of the second round winner , between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But Gbagbo camp relies on the cancellation of the Constitutional Council for "stupid" voting in the north, managed by the former insurgents of the New Army (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the electoral intimidation maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country had discouraged the president's supporters of the Ivory Coast from going to vote.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council looked at the complaints Gbagbo made.
However, President Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally to President Gbagbo, is driving it.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who is demeaning any connection with former insurgents, condemned the delay in the announcement of results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
Its allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered a loss and that it would be illegal to file a complaint against the Constitutional Council after he has prevented the election committee from delivering the results.
The second round of the presidential elections, which took place on Sunday, was considered a coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two and a half years.
The United Nations warned on the Wednesday of the political faction of Côte d'Ivoire that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished on the first round, October 31st, as a winner with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassan Ouattar, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédie (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
According to the International Labour Office (BIT), the unemployment rate in France remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as illustrated by the background data with the correction of seasonal deviations (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed settled to 2.631 million in the metropolitan area.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolitan area and 9.7%, including the overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 point.
In a broader picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work and whether they are looking or not.
The situation of young people today in the labour market was still rising with a new increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan France (+ 0.9 point in three months, +0.5 point in one year) and 25% in the overseas areas.
In the third quarter, the International Labour Office stated that 637 000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed.
As far as seniors are concerned, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 point in three months, as well as in one year), 482,000 people from 50 years of age and 6.6%, including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 years benefited from the unemployment rate of 8.3% in the metropolitan France (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after the controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, a statistical agency of the European Union, continues to produce monthly statistics, and announced on Tuesday 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and imprisoned.
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the directors of waste-processing companies and the brother of PS Management Board Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of public procurement investigations allegedly subdued.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of abuse of the company's assets, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, payment, acceptance of bribes for the purpose of affecting the office and holding the ammunition, his lawyer states.
"Alexandre Guérini is a warrior, and he insists that the judge explain all the questions he intends to ask him, and not some delusion."
"It is easy to pursue him for many punitive reasons, but another thing is to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, said before questioning her client.
Mr. Guérini told his lawyers that he had sent a brief message to the judge before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than to ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their functioning, he never knew such a thing, said Mr Simon.
In this matter Daniel Pinna, former Director General of Aglomeration Services Aubagne, was charged at the centre for mistreatment of public funds and composting, and left at liberty under the judicial supervision of the ban to meet, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client has been able to explain to him all the facts that have been raised against him."
"The investigating judge will look into it and let him go free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnux.
Another four persons were charged and released on Wednesday night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with being under judicial supervision for two of them, said the prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with elegance of Marseille Provence Métrople (MPM), is charged with accepting bribes for the purpose of affecting the Office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "disposal and abuse of the company's assets", the other for "competence in the misuse of public funds".
Finally, business associate Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "detaining the abuse of the company's assets".
Among those confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused of parallel cases of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company was helping to clean money out of large-scale gangs.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009, following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities in the Marseille City Community (MPM).
The case of Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian Palace exceeded the mediation of Syria
In more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotilda Reiss, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spionage", unified his views in France, put diplomacy into action and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this has been closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases by hostages in Iran (a small group of fliers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was no compensation for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and a wanted American justice for the long trade in material for the benefit of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they submit to sharp light the way the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media in order to credulate the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in liberating Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title: "Iran:French comments on the solution in the case of hostages".
Counsellor from the Elyse Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Central East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to the American diplomat Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that the Americans do the same for him to be transported back to the homeland of his own nationals by violence in Iran.
"Do make noise," they say, "always put emphasis on the words "in the media of the fundamental rights of man", "innocentness", "immediate deliverance".
It is necessary to bring into a difficult Iranian mode, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop."
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, 'which will not solve anything', the Iranians are 'masters of evasive maneuvers'.
Mr. Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is "Iran family tactics: defending hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail".
It announces that the liberation of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, on the day on which the French Embassy will provide her shelter) "will require the payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (coutage 230,000 euros).
And they will announce that the Elysée Palace is anticipating cases of hostages, a phenomenon that will "envelop."
The Iranians "could arrest in the future some 1,800 other French people living in Iran", says.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but he remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, declared by the United States to have been expelled for illegal trade in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The American Embassy, as well as many observers, is questioning this disturbing consensus.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to acquire material for the nuclear programme, the deployment of Majid Khakavanda is a bad news.
France enter into a contract?
The liberation of Iran for the liberation of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4th, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he states, was not only "stunned by this decision by the judge", but was looking for a way to resist it.
"Conversations were held between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court," it notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
Counselor of the Elysée Palace turns up his phone number, hangs up his phone headphone, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is currently in the Paris buildings administered by the Iranian Embassy."
At the time of Klotilda Reiss' imprisonment in Iran, the Elyse Palace is developing efforts, negotiating, through communication and organized "disasters" into the media, to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play "a prominent" and "influenced" role of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and find that manipulation carries its fruit, because several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
Telegram dated 25 August 2009 evociates the media "blist" of French officials.
On what basis is such a rate of "thank you" expressed against M. Assad? He asks the embassy in Paris.
"Though their statements are full of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only vague ideas of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons which forced the Elyse Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "focuss on the validation of President Sarkozy's policy of opening Syria", analyzes.
The policy applied in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "the way the Syrian role goes beyond", Paris seeks to "demonstrate Syria, which praisers can enjoy when playing a constructive role in the area".
The aim is also to "sow grain of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows it from a very good source.
August 11th, François Richie said to him, "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we still thanked them."
"This should at least cause confusion and confusion among the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts it at the Elysée Palace.
In the communication, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of freeing our country".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecivalský", which will ban the adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, the responsible government officials stated.
The draft law will be submitted to Parliament in December in order to ask companies running online games to block access to these games after midnight to under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with schooling and are unable to lead normal lives during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the head of the Ministry, who has a draft law in charge.
Online games will be newly available from 6 am.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, clarify.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit their daily access to these games for young people whose parents are asked to do so by a responsible worker.
It will also make it available to people who ask for it, free programs, allowing you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "honest" and daily printing brings on a regular basis various facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
The World Cup 2018-2022: Fifa sets up host countries.
Full unrest over suspicions of corruption is established by the Executive Committee of Fifa on Thursdays of the World Cup Host Country in 2018 and 2022, a choice of supremely politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk that technical criteria will precede.
The thing is certain, Fifa's royal competition in 2018 will be held in Europe , the traditional fairy tale of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping that it will be able to acquire new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere of the African continent in 2010, or continue to enter the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities involved in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, Head of Government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of the world's economic and political betting.
Negotiations behind the scenes face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to Fifa's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments as well as documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for 22 members of the executive committee in an hour to vote.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of its discovery leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for Corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may thus have destroyed its country's chances, the cradle of kicks, which so far hosted the world championship only once, in a year.
On Monday, the BBC planted a crown when it sent a document that "drunked a pin" three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa dissatisfied and bring to the trouble of the English executive with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will succeed in repeating the move that his predecessor led in the function of Tony Blair, who managed to win the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Will this intensive activity suffice for England to add a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the couples of Spain-Portugal do not miss the trumps of the already prepared stadiums, their welcome (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Case-laws against the Englishmen and doubts about the payment capacity of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly declared "several competition in the preparation of the vote", in the words only barely referring to the accusations of the English press against the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022 it seems to be a logical favourite for the United States with its considerable experience from 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of the main sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a great run ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem premature for both countries that together did "test" in 2002.
Another threat: Allocation of World Cup 2026 China, which Fifa desperately desires, has made the Asian chance for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, which pulled out of the sleeve of a large ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new regions, but these two countries pose more risks than security.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for cheap TV charges (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, which constitute the driving force for Fifa.
Second mandate: obvious (certainty)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand seemed to hesitate.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysée Palace calls someone else.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in line with the contribution to the secret of the presidency.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts persist.
In one way and another.
In 2006, friends of Jacques Chiraca claimed that the third mandate should not be excluded.
In November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy said that he would "make a decision sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As the UMP members are reminded of Wednesday evening at the Elysée Palace, the perspective of the "two mandate" has taken on a little heat.
Was it the official notification of his candidate?
He wasn't far from that.
The President merely recalled that the revision of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not a notification.
It's not the first time he's reminded of the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he sold in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His earlier statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate nor less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the double truth.
Speeding up the way to the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to Ségolèn Royal's cradle, pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, it is because its candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to organize in combat teams rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, the voters would prefer Françoise Fillon to run for Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the issue with the UMP," they reacted immediately and cautiously people from the immediate vicinity of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes possible defeat, he won't run," reports Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, which is balanced with clarity.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue its procurement of state titles.
The last meeting of the Central Council of Governors in the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for recovery from the crisis or, at least, a notification of the suspension of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of the sovereign European debt is binding, the securities institution will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of a deterioration of the situation today so tense in European securities markets.
The political price would then be higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, gave up the active role played by the Central European Bank in addressing the crisis of European states' claims.
She didn't want to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing their program to buy sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners..."
The President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear more eloquent about his intentions in Brussels in his hearing of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, and was satisfied that he stated that the programme for the purchase of state titles in the secondary market "is going on" and that "we will see how we will decide" during the session which takes place this Thursday.
The only certainty: The Central European Bank will keep its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the central European Bank’s treasury bonds doubled to nearly EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the misunderstanding of the market participants, yesterday she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the Eurosystem's central banks have bought EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the market-based anti-cipation agreements on the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Neither economists expect any significant change in course.
If the lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central Bank's arsenal, the last designated bank shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquidity under generous conditions and for a period of between one week and three months.
Today, economists expect this mechanism to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she'd change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, economist Commerzbank.
"The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In order to plan its public debt market interventions, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchase of its bonds in order to re-energise the cold market", adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, there is nothing more to choose than to maintain their presence on the market.
"He needs to replace, at all costs, the lack of investors on the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the recovery of the paid performance of the countries that are among the most fragile," the prominent bond administrator testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates were to take off, the states would be more concerned about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It is saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi's back humps
After the beginning of the week for Italy, the situation eased slightly, with a backlog of bond interest for 10 years last night.
Back to a temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the presidents of the regions said they had heard Giulia Tremonti, how he qualified the situation as "unsolved" and that he expected a "unforeseen" weekend, which he then denounced.
In any case, on Tuesday, the derogation from the long German interest reached a record of 210 basic points and the price of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) flew up to 263 points, which caused some disruption in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was more than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, declared himself to be "too busy" by the "best development of markets" and a possible disease originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Right and non-encrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and the lack of fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk that it will not be able to cover up its funding needs.
The last of Brussels' forecasts were cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is currently expected to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission is calculating, the deficit of public finances will be 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% of the expected government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From there, a report on a new set of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," says Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
"The underlying stones of her economy are fine and her calculations are correct, we repeat it for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian member of the Board of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term or long-term, because, despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the effort to stabilise the effort required in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the main economy of OCDE.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be facing a motion for a statement of mistrust by the Chamber of Deputies, and then elections to be held at the end of March could be organised.
Such a period would start, it would not be appropriate for a decision to be taken in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde stressed it again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans demonstrated it on Sundays and nights, are obviously very solid resolves, engaging in defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion concerning interest on European sovereign bonds has brought water for mills to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
Standard & Poor's Notation Office has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, the goals to which various speculations focus most.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and clear policy, based mainly on banking systems," says Exane BNP Paribas.
Moreover, "political time is running slower than market time".
Knowing this interrupted context and the danger it conceals, European countries are intensifying the debate aimed at strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected problem, and on a broader scale with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
In view of Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroup) and Ecofin group meetings from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is taking place today.
The programme has the fate of non-conventional measures in support of euro area countries with a focus on the market (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, ordered a trip to Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors from the Far East of the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not intended to increase the funds, it prepares its real land to achieve this objective.
The first issue of FESSF securities is expected to be issued next month.
Yesterday, an American official told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in the mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries concerned in the first instance, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are attached to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid are a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international assistance at any cost before applying their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their trust.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the process of normalisation of markets with sovereign bonds.
On its way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether it would not be enough to mobilise EUR 750 billion for Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to re-arrest its securities.
The Barclays Capital economists, who is the actor of the very first European sovereign trade plan, believe that an addition of about EUR 100 billion would suffice, rather, in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The budget exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is subsidized to this day by €60 billion.
The Council, which has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorated.
Snow and surroundings: 24 regions has an orange emergency.
Snow rations cause further difficulties in transport, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting certain economic activities.
Twenty-four districts now have an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, forest deux-Sèvres a la Vienna, joined the 20 districts that have already declared an orange emergency, 18 since the middle afternoon and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snow flows cause problems in the north of La Gironde and les Charentes, and are weakly snowed on Ile-de-France.
Snow blanket from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and a blanket from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the region of Paris.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dorogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snow flows are big enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts prohibited the passage of heavy freight transport - trucks over 7,5 tonnes with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police officers, and police recommend driving their vehicle only if it is really necessary and the traffic of some trucks was canceled for this day.
School connections were banned Thursday in Picardia.
On Wednesday evening no special measures shall be envisaged to restrict freight transport.
The district office "calls all drivers of cars to the utmost caution on the road and to adapt the driving nature of the road".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissa Airport in Paris on Thursday and 10% at Orly due to expected snow flows.
DGAC recommends to passengers using air transport services to connect with their companies.
In the UK, Gatwick airport in southern London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the discussion on modernising transport to Ile-de-France in full stream, it has rained billions.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we recall the 23 billion Grand Paris Metro to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this building to be launched, the State announced a grant of EUR 4 billion.
It is purely theoretically an amount that will allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Act, which examines the Financial Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms established to ensure such funds.
There are two: creating special tax on equipment and increasing tax from offices to Ile-de-France.
First, the text of the draft law, Article 15, reads "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The return on this interest is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for offices already in existence "to be modernised to increase its yield and to touch Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
It's delusional.
That's not calculated in the text.
We've got four billion miles away.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are connected to the 4 billion euro from the capital subsidy that will be mobilised by the State and invested in Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in explanation of reasons.
This system does not seem shocking to us in SGP.
"Since we created revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study for three years and then go to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It shall be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will be added to the 2014 budget in 2013.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised still belong to absent subscribers, risks causing a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and caustic scouts
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is a clear scandal, a scandal that seems to be just a scandal in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level, and it moves forward with a future controlled regression.
But let's move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this confirms the fact that every document drawn up by the secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of press releases.
The "immortal revelation" of Americans about the way in which Berlusconi's sexual life is reported is what everyone has been able to read for months in any newspaper (all except those two Berlusconi owns), and the ridiculous cartoon profile of Kadafí has long been an object for sketches for cabaret artists..
The rule that secret documents may consist only of reports already known is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to the esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (the graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Temple or Zedních) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And that is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (not knowing where to look for reports of non-existent), but because those who practice occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before.
It's a success mechanism for Dan Brown.
The same applies to classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or a limited spirit) head of secret services (and, if not, he could be, as I know, editor in Libération), who considers true only what he himself admits.
Information with high secrecy about Berlusconi, which the US embassy sent to the state resort, was the same as Newsweek published a week ago.
Why, then, was there so much commotion around the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, and although the embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can call or fly on a plane to a common dinner, they have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into a spying center.
Any viewer watching films on the investigation knows very well that only out of lycometry does it seem to ignore it.
However, the fact that it repeats itself in public, the disgrace of the duty of hypocrisy, and the mislight of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the most top secret information the most powerful country in the world is a hard hit, not a careless one, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and his "customer."
But let's move on from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to take all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every move of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since the possibility of controlling every movement through the phone, every transaction carried out, the visited hotel, the used highway, and so on, became a citizen of the ultimate sacrifice of the age of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now that even "graves" with the most secret information powerful can't resist the intervention of some hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes an obituary.
It's a lot of control for every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker, elected as the citizen's vigilante, can know all the secrets of power.
How can power be maintained that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that George Simmel has already said that true secret is an absolute secret (and an absolute secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious mystery because it is extracted from public life; but to reveal, as did WikiLeaks, that Hillary Clinton's secret was absolute secrets means to take all his power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this morning’s giving of power so significant?
It is obvious that in the future, states will not be able to send online sensitive information - this would be equal to its publication on a poster mounted on the corner of the street.
But it is also absolutely obvious that it is unnecessary to hope with current technologies that you can keep a secret message on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and connected with one of her colleagues.
How will they be kept private and sensitive reports in the future?
I know that for this moment my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government agents who carry discreetly performing formalities after uncontrollable routes and carry only those messages that know memory or rather hide rare information in their shoe heel.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in key-locked drawers: in total, the attempted spying in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, which means backwards.
One century after a wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogs) have allowed movie lovers to film step by step, move it forward and draw away and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, so now the CDs (numerical) allow just to jump over chapters, that means macropores.
By means of speedboats, we will arrive from Rome in Milan in three hours, while on the road by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is not unusual, therefore, that politics and communication technology will return to the cars of drawn horses.
Last remark.
On another occasion, the press attempted to understand what had been established in the embassy’s secret.
Now it's an embassy asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to keep the promises of fast-delayed financing (said fast-start funding (fast-start) or premature) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were discovered.
In the Copenhagen Accord, the developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion for three years and France €1.26 billion (that is 420 million per year).
At the beginning of COP16, the EU pulled a large esa to convince its partners about the reality of its fast start funding commitment: a report clarifying the action of its Member States, a press conference, grand side event, distribution of pamphlets...
Transparent operations are invaluable and valued at their real value: advanced countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and to do the same with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, leading it to the right path to keep its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the burden is increased without harming public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no match in what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the referendum that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered the 2009 reference: international funding has been maintained and it adds 150 million to the title of fast start funding for three years.
Other countries have chosen similar references to annual payment terms or to terms at the level of public development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of all new projects in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide publicque and the développement.
In particular, the total amount of France’s aid to developing countries may remain constant (or even decrease) and should respect its commitment to financing “new and additional” ...
The next decisive element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule there, and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that the 1st loan is equal to the 1st gift.
Obviously, it's hard to prove: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be proven for certain investments that are profitable (often related to projects related to emission reductions consisting in more efficient technologies), the debauchery presents one euro that we will receive as equivalent to the one euro we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments but as the price of the loan for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only make this statement: "observes" its commitment of €420 million, making 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the donations (€36.1 million) - see an EU document to verify this for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan to that extent.
Germany demanded 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (between others) adhere to their commitments with 100% gifts.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives 1 to its promise, France will only give 10 cents and sees this effort as comparable.
Beautiful barber's piece!
In order to sum up, France is operating with a double sheikh in its funding, on the one hand with the development of a stock in time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Although only €36.1 million is issued, it can convince that it issues €420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems to be Bertie who made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when just borrowing?) and negotiating, because developing countries are not entirely naive...
The early funding chapter is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine such as the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever this is, it is necessary to draw knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounts for 2011 and 2012, in a manner consistent with its obligations and due diligence and justice towards other countries of the European Union.
But first of all, France should avoid discussing contributions to long-term financing (other major chapter currently under discussion): we will not avoid the question of "additional" or the way in which loans are credited.
France should change its position to become as progressive with these deposits as with others.
So everyone is putting hope in the new Environment Minister, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, who will come to Cancún next week.
Surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of "additional" and the use of loans could lead to an increase in the level of international trust needed to move forward in the discussions.
An alarm about pesticides that will kill children.
A ten-year-old child dies one day of 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Move for Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The Association, which points out that its results "does not have a significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed problem", bought between July and September food normally consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for a child roughly decades in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water daily - as well as diabetes, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is crushing: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are carcinogenic, possibly or likely, and five substances belong to clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to glands with internal mixing (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all cases, the statutory limits for each individual chemical adopted are not exceeded, in our research we see well that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants may be carcinogenic, and/or PE is contagious," the association states.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain, in themselves, about ten residiums with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
An apple imported from Brazil, submitted as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, which are included in lunch, where studies have found traces of strong insecticides prohibited in the EU.
In addition, meat steaks, tuna in the can, and even mushrooms and gum were spicy pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
The salmon steak for dinner was "the richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "contamination cocktail" is likely to be underestimated", according to the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greening Group (EE-LV) proposed to set up a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increasing of civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the condition of the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in sheep and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which were in cereal.
