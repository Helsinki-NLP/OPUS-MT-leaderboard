On an emergency call, the professor admitted he shot his girlfriend.
During his call to the emergency line with the shuddering voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and had to come home to them.
Lamb presupposes that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that contacts on the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and handwritten report on the white office paper, "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," was in a letter signed by Lamb, according to the authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would have traveled 300 miles to the school campus where the police thought he had shot his favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
Chief of Police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said university staff heard shots at 10:18 this morning.
I heard the lamb made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
Finally came another death; Lamb took his own life when the police came to get him.
The day after the school shooting forced the students and the faculty to hide behind the locked doors, the authorized authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details published by state investigators and students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented but likely problematic teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record in the criminal register or violent history.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote to thank the "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, along with the other 17 members of the Faculty, and many students attended courses at the same time.
At the same time, there was inclination as regards problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed encouraged and shaken, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that a doctorate that Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba must have been in trouble."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving campus, police picked up his trail as he crossed the Arkansas border back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single shot from a gun at the door of the house about a mile from his parents at the Greenville suburb of Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb started working at a university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and education lessons.
He got a Ph.D. in spring.
One of Lamba’s long friends described him as a clever, charismatic, and funny man.
Carla Hairton said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when she met with her friends.
She was with her friends at high school, and he was the great older boy who had been teaching her guitar playing for years.
He was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The heart of all the girls grew stronger as soon as he appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss seemed to have been dating for some time.
During an emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was never a record of a wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house that was next to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely devastated," said O'Sten about her daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
He said that he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail staged a summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter is writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and an occasional entertainment coordinator at The Jule Room, a sporadic bright bar near Gautier, said he had last seen Lamba and Prentiss at night on September 5th, the path Lamb won on guitar and harmonica for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We flattered and made fun of each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led the seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and government students.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, staff, students and community members, attended commemorative events with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also took part in the violin, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story has been edited to reflect the fact that the police are now claiming that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb named Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually given up.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer season workers
Toys R Us declare that they will not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the producers of children's toys and products claim to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in shops and distribution centres throughout the country, which is a decline compared to 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting applicants this month, and the staff will be recruited during October until December.
While the holiday itself is months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to accept employees temporarily to assist in trade and sales, to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royal family to come, when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that there would be Princess Diana," said in the trailer for the coming document, "back in time."
The film begins and I realize that I am within reach of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in Time," is a document on "Return to the Future," which lists interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It is indeed the best travel document ever filmed for me."
"Back in Time" will be available for water, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there's no military solution in Syria.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of almost five years and more weapons only worsens violence and suffering millions of people.
Once again, the UN chief urged all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said at the Wednesday press conference that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of countries - the USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the end of this month's meeting of the General Assembly ministerial meeting to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed his regret that the division in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation insolvent."
The Ban called on five permanent members to show solidarity and unity, which they showed when they reached the Iranian nuclear deal in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers showing Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes opinions.
The rest of the hands above the head of the head as above the inconceivable joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But even though some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are failing (for the time being).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people are seriously asking what this means for the nominal chance of this magnate in the area of real estate.
Of course, it is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011 Rick Perry took the lead on the way to Herman Cain’s rise, finally not one of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might encounter general elections.
But outside groups such as the Super PAC Jeba Bush and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and begin to put their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent votes indicating that a real estate magnate is not just a passing phase:
Trump's benefit rating turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now he has six of the 10 Republicans with a favourable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have negative views on him.
And these numbers are kept in the initial stages.
After the University of Quinnipiac voted last week, it was found that 60 percent of the Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey, which took place last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would be either "suspension" or "satisfaction" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "worse" from his candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "suffered" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
Another closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters claim to be "unsatisfied" or "disturbed" if favoured by Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his inaccuracies and insults, 52 percent of the Republican voters are all over the world inclined to think that the real world has the right temperament for the post of president, according to the Monday vote of the ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is kept in the senatorial club of the state of Iowa, which is the first in the whole country, where 52 percent of Republicans think they have the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think that he has no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independent say that his temper does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this idea.
When he wears his academic hats, the Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
To the question of who most likely wins the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC survey of last week.
That's a change from July, when four out of 10 staked their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete publication: GOP voters had not in the past the brightest crystal ball.
This time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the 28% candidate for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
However, it turns out that a number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump still defeats almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trumpo support is diffused between more than a dozen other candidates.
But research by Monmouth University in early September shows that in the hypothetical direct struggle between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates Trump will receive almost always majority support.
He leads the Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally by Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christ by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead a merchant by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match against each other.
The vast majority of supporters of Donald Trump claim that they have already made their views.
A new Tuesday poll by CBS/NYT shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump claim that he will not change his mind.
It is obvious that many things can change, and no one really can say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep an open back door for a change between candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 of the 10 republicans allegedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even from the moment Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapers" in his campaign's announcement, immigration still holds as the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some fear that Trump's embezzlement diverts key Spanish voters from the Republic's side and undermines the rebranding force.
But according to the new Monday poll of public opinion ABC/Post, six of the 10 republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the light bulbs, Donald Trump will remain as well.
The government's frustration is reaching new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are receiving approximately half of the support from the Republican voters today, especially given their situation as outsiders.
Six of the 10 republicans in the new Monday vote ABC/Post say they prefer political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The vote of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four republicans in Iowa were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "disturbed" and 21 percent were "infernally angry."
The House supported a larger proportion of the state's coal charges.
The Czech Republic gains more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Chamber supported the government amendment of the upper law, which regulates the amount of payment of the surface mining charges of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that this would result in extra money for both the Treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
Members of the opposition who fear that the mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they do so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The Assembly, in its first reading, supported the government amendment of the upper law, which means, among other things, that the State should receive a greater part of the payment of the surface mining charges of brown coal from the mining company.
The State's share will increase to 67 percent, while the proportion of municipalities will fall from the present 75 percent to 33 percent.
The proposal also changes the way in which the remuneration for the non-growth that the companies will exploit will be calculated.
The change in mining charges is expected to bring CZK 427 million to the Treasury by more than in 2013.
According to the Government, the revenue of the municipalities should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
About 450 million crowns and a state budget of 150 million crowns were paid to the municipalities in the previous year.
The mining of brown coal was about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns of state.
The novel is also accounted for by an increase of one hectare per year from the extraction area allowed for mining to 1000 crowns.
The revenue from these payments should continue to belong to the municipalities to the full extent.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MEPs that the municipalities would receive 14 million to 100 million crowns per year.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Reimbursement shall be recalculated as a product of the amount of the extracted minerals and the rates for each species of the minerals.
According to the government, the possibility of a flexible reaction to the current economic situation is a reason for the change.
However, Ambassador Marek Benda of the ODS warned that the determination of the fee by government regulation may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax case, since the state pays the non-growth that is State property.
Fees shall be paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the city's money and a quarter of the state's money will be delivered.
The same ratio will be found in the case of mining of radioactive rock.
Part of the money that the state collects on mining charges will be purposely tied.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a bane rescue service.
The opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by mining and the regions, criticized the pretext.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and the Mayors) warned that the mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they have so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance improves his budget," said David Kadner (Usvit) elected in the Ústice region.
Before the rise of unemployment in Mosteck, she warned the Member of the KSČM Hana Aulic.
Kadner and the Aulics unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted the law to return to the government for processing.
The reason for the report is that according to mining companies, the increase in charges will not be reflected in the price of coal because prices are over 90 per cent long-term negotiated.
The main consumers as power plants or heat plants should therefore not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that a mining organisation will compensate for the increase in remuneration for its efforts to reduce its operating expenditure, which would in particular mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government allows.
However, according to her, the increase in employment charges is a lucrative one.
According to the rapporteur for the novel Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members of Parliament know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government decision on coal mining limits prior to the adoption of the law.
If the coal is going to be worth even the limits, then it will have implications for the state as well as the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the lower Czechoslovak Army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of ČSA should already be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy, according to him.
Happy will guide the Czechs as a refrigerator, setting will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear during the Thursday break of the Davis Cup in India on the board and this time each of them will most likely hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to place the burden on the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
In Delhi there is a heat and high humidity of air, so there are challenging matches that can take up to five hundred.
We have to keep an eye on this.
I'd like to expand it according to the weather.
And according to what it will look like, he said Navrátil during today's Czech selection training in the center of Raja Kumár Khanna.
With the team's 1st and the world's 40s, Jiří Vesely is counting on Friday and Sunday's two games.
Luke Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are likely to be responsible for the position of the two.
I'd like almost everyone to get involved.
I've got it in my head, but I'm not saying it yet, the captain said.
Another surety in the Czech composition should be Štěpánka's participation in the Saturday four game.
It's just a question of who's gonna stand next to an experienced deblicacy who's got in Davis' cup in the four-game balance of 18:4.
He's probably not happy.
There are other options with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know who and what it will look like," Navril said.
It is decided according to the development of two games.
Variantou can be Pavlásek, with Happy, surprised at the 1st round win in the arch over Australia.
"He's decent in the trunk," said Navrátil.
I've done it against Australia, and if I'm gonna play, I'd like to do the same performance I've shown since the second set.
"I am happy for those experiences, and I would like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
The home is placed in Yuki Bhambri's two games (125th ATP ladder), which won last week the challenger in Shanghai, where he defeated the players of the third and fourth hundred ladders.
The double will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challengers and ours have experience with ATP Tour, but we've been convinced many times that the ladders in Davis' cup don't decide.
"It decides the current form, the weather," said Navrátil.
Friday's opening two games will begin at 6:30 PM SELČ and can be drawn due to the weather.
It's supposed to rain, and it's not under the roof.
It may, however, be played for artificial lighting, if appropriate.
They've already burned it, and it's got about two grand, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," said Navrhal.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on Prime Minister's Quests
Since his election, Mr. Corbin's debut in PMQ has been very excitedly expected
Jeremy Corbyn's new working manager will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time will be working with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement, he asked "less theatres and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC annual congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leader to stand quietly during the singing of the national anthem on Tuesday to the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle for Britain was met with criticism from a number of conservative Members and is the focus of the attention of several stories on the headline pages of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing a national anthem draws attention to itself.
The speaker Mr. Corbin said he would be "standing in a respectful silence" and that he recognized "the hero of the Royal Air Force in the battle for Britain."
However, Mr. Corbin's member of the shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, informed BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend to the Labour Leader to sing a national anthem "without regard" to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbin's top team, quoted differences in economics, defences and foreign affairs, and only less than a dozen parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "harmonised" after the appointment of Mr Corbin over his position in the European Union and the government dose limit.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Working Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, stated that the party 'very clear' had opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26.000 to £23.000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party, faced by David Cameron in the last decade of his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the working party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas "from the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims to be too confrontational for PMQ and that it will hold back both the "hot responses" and the toothless business, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secret, will represent him on PMQ if he does not participate — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea that he would let other colleagues step up to him from time to time because he heard that the whole matter was still under discussion with the House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to turn away from the political style of "Punch and Judy," which was often associated with PMQ, but he admitted that he had failed several years later.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the judgment of the leaders, their leadership of the House and their attitude among the other MPs, although critics argued that they have become a cartoon and need far-reaching reforms.
"Focation in Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
The Johannesburg Center is a tough place to be homeless.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra rises while salary growth in Great Britain accelerates
Libra jumped the following dates and showed a recovery of British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was led above with the SABMiller offer target.
Between May and June GB profits including bonuses rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed as if the estimates were getting closer when the rates were going up.
Sterling stood more than 1% against the dollar at $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped 20% after he got close to the offer from his AB InBev rival.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and the approximation of brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry stock was 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the rival luxury group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
The shares in Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
Stocks in the Mondi packing and paper group were the biggest failure on the index and dropped by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating to "sale."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in mid-year in the before tax rate £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion.
Executive Chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
Costs could affect plans for the expansion of JD Sports, added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of Prague apartment marshmallow are screaming.
Controversial construction got a trace.
Investor Prague Progetti e Investiments considers the annulment of the decision to be illegal and will appeal against it.
A petition was also made in front of the Prague office for protesting the building, which is to be built in the vicinity of the Anez Monastery in the centre of Prague.
The magistrate in the decision found that there had been a breach of the construction law because all the elements of the territorial decision had not been respected.
"The preliminary territorial decision does not contain certain features, such as the type of land, distance from adjacent buildings, sufficiently clear and understandablely described shape of the building, delimitation of the territory affected by the influence of the construction," it states.
The illegal magistrate also considers that some of the grounds for the decision have been issued to the original documentation, which has changed.
For example, it is the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the plots of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid approval.
The inventory material shows, however, that the landowner has only submitted his consent to the project documentation for the territorial management, does not agree to the placement of the building on his property, writes the Construction Order Department.
According to Francesc Augusto Razetta of the investment firm, the committee of the building code did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the start of the review has expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, following all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which is claimed to have been called marshmallow because of its proposed facade color, is triggered by strong emotions in Prague.
In the city center, hundreds of people have protested against the building in the past.
The association and the people of nearby homes resent the fact that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the construction for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Anez Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Franek, the project has changed several times.
The original design of the 2008 project, which included a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the view of the National Memorial Institute (NPP) and cancelled the permit of Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investiments with windows into the shape of the faces, but the NPU and master monuments approved and construction permits were issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the reproaches of the opponents, said he never counted with the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname for the pink-white sugar.
Czech politicians have taken migrants away.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way, he and his crew drove three Syrian refugees who said they wanted to drive about a mile.
At that time, he believed that Hungary was not yet criminal, claiming to the people's papers.
We knew that the guardians of the law did not act in such a way.
But when the police stopped us, we were arrested for our surprise and transferred to the Szeged investigation, he described a letter.
In the end, the politicians spent nine hours.
The police said they were doing the right thing, but they were communicating because they couldn't speak English too well.
However, he found the prison to be threefold.
For example, in our cell, about three times four metres in size, 15 refugees from Syria were under pressure.
Among them was a two - year - old boy or a four - year - old girl.
These people have been imprisoned there the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them, Berg said.
What's he not to confiscate?

You can ask her about changes to the law on executions applicable from 1 September 2015 and to other matters related to executions, or exectors.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA business from the Aldi's resistance in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand with marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added with brands such as Dunsborough based on Simmo's ice cream maker offering flavors in IGA shops and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of his defence strategy on 29 September, when food, alcohol and hardware sellers celebrate their annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake, because Southern and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in Eastern countries.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will count on 5 per cent of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of opening the first deals that took over from all existing players but mostly independent retailers.
This week in his report analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose USD 360 million per year and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in South Australia and 30 in Western during the next year, and will generate sales of $500 million and 600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes at the firm price base of Metcash could cost him about USD 13 million on income before tax, confirmed Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, especially Aldi and Coles, although the latest survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that food sales of Metcash will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Head of the Hamish Douglas Fund Manager, Founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that a business lunch in Melbourne could "very likely disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas's comment.
But it is known that a board member of Metcash contacted Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and the Metcash food trade, which supplies about 1200 retail IGA , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the speculation change as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesale trade has gone into the counterattack and invests more than USD 150 million a year to match the flat prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and thus helps IGA retailers re-arrange IGAs by adding fast-growing food and news from privates.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the pricing and shopping programmes will fall and hopes that wholesale sales will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more than criticism for his behavior of fame.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a secondary loss in the recent outburst around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves to be praised for his behavior rather than critics, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself thanks to an affair with the notorious Kyrgios and State of Wawrinka on Montreal Masters.
Soon afterward, in a passionate qualifying game in Cincinnati, there had to be Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated by the referee, Harrison then said, "Wawrinka had one to pull on Kyrgios and I should have pulled on him too."
While he was last seen crashing the missile after the cramps burned Richard Gasquet's possible defeat at the US Open, Kokkinakis was relentlessly defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he and Sam Groth competes for the second two-game placement behind Bernard Romace in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I was thinking quite intensely about Thanasi, in my opinion, being a bit strained in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost for the convulsion in the US, but he's not the first player to throw himself out for frustration at his rocket. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he was really doing very well because in the US he was exposed to very provocative circumstances because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a great deal of recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, and he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated kind of hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he falls into the team great and so on, he's never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he's trained hard, he's in an amazing condition, he's a very stable and mature young boy, and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own merit.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios due to the important match that starts on Friday, and states that "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports the parent from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term stand.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy surrounding [Kyrgyos]," says Healy.
And I think Nick stepped up very quickly, as Federerer, Murray and other people point out, in public eyes he's growing fast, he's also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and for some time outside the message, when he's able to think about it, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and for him alone.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the status of the threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who attempted to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country no one, and Serbian authorities reacted in an uproar.
Those who have been confined to the strips of the earth for an unknown time between the two states stand for those who flee from violence in their homelands, and establish tents and dwell.
But there's feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter crosses over them, the migrants together call "Open the border!" and they hand over a regular unit to the Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water for protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just an indirect injury.
Over the next days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacc in Prague.
Disturbing the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the bloc of 28 countries did not come with a single immigration policy at the ongoing meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece, and talked about the prospect of reaching an eventual agreement for another month or the end of the year that the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for another week's European summit to discuss a continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not turn its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the threat situation in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a fence from a wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees seeking to cross their country when a fence at the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D ́Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to pull wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point in the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go to a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, a view which is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary are now criminalising a violation of the 4m fence that the government has set up on the southern border with Serbia, and also establishing longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the threat," Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesman in the southern town of Szeged, told reporters.
In this we have quite clear: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of an army that was expected next week, but reporters Associated Press on the border have been watching a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, Orban's home defence adviser, said that the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and caught 15 already on state territory.
They've penetrated the fence and now they're in police custody accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence fixed.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after the use of a tractor covered by a barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at Rozke, chaos arose because the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and the push of people.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's raid in front of Bernie Sanders fell by half in a national vote
The former Foreign Minister, Hillary Clinton, still holds a two-digit lead in the Democratic Race for National Appointment, but Senator Bernie Sanders is ahead.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of democratic primary voters (a fall of 58 per cent), while Sanders is second in 27 per cent (a rise of 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is about to announce whether he wants to become president, receives support from 15 percent of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic electorate claims that it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions that candidates will support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton's soil has been lost under her feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton keeps a great lead between women and eases, but her leadership is narrowing down.
Her support between men has fallen significantly and Sanders loses only 5 points.
The benefit of Clinton with democratic voters under 50 years of age has disappeared, and now Sanders is equal.
However, Clinton still has great leadership thanks to the older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit head start for Sanders between the liberals, but now Sanders loses only 5 points on it.
About half the democratic primary voters in all the states say they would be excited to support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support it with certain reservations and another 15 percent would only support it for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
I don't think it's surprising that present-day Clinton followers are particularly resentful of her.
The views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the time has come to be president of a woman (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, there is a large possibility of selecting and agreeing on problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential candidate, 57 percent of the democratic primary voters would wish that - a third of them again think that he should not run.
When the primary democratic voters were questioned, whom they would choose as the second choice for the nomination of the party, the most common option is Biden.
Clinton's supporters listed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden is running, to 30 points without his candidate.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance of winning the general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 percent last month.
Poverty is a far second in this scale, but the percentage of people who see it as most likely is increasing.
However, when it comes to the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance to be elected.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate will stand as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics between the primary voters of their parties.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and credible and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Poor man of all three leads honestly, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary voters don't think Clinton's fair and credible, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't.
Primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
As far as all these measures are concerned, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal e-mail and the server as a state secret continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter and say that this did not affect her overall view at all.
But among the American public, it's a completely different story.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were already divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no impact on their overall view of Clinton, while their view of Clinton has worsened by 36 percent.
It is mainly the Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim to have worsened their view of Clinton.
Although Clinton is perceived as being honest and credible among the voters of her party, this question is still a problem between registered voters overall: only 32 percent see it as an honest and credible one, which is a fall of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and credible.
However, Clinton and Trump both have good marks for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson, and Bush were the best in honor.
Sanders sees more people as honorable than dishonest, but, like Carson's, a lot of voters didn't think of him.
The error margin for sample 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up behind Donald Trump in national elections.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest polls and the others are asking for support.
Votes from a number of republicans across the country continue to support Trump with a crushing majority, and have climbed from 23% of the support in the latest CBS survey carried out before the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and excommunicating Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The remaining field with the exception of Carly Fiorin and the Governor of the state of Ohio John Kasiche, is behind together with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker completely on the verge of 10% support dropped to the current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckbee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place together with 6%.
The error margin for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of support among Republicans for Trump 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
At Carson's rising trend, Trump decided to go blind to a neurosurgeon in his service, and even Carson apologized for questioning about Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged with the death of a student in the first year Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the overworked brotherly ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder charge against five people was filed.
The fraternity members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Denga during the ceremony in September 2013 and the late ones took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, announced to the police.
The policeman states that he had his eyes tied, had a bag full of sand of a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches and then passed out.
Members of Pi Delta Dogs didn't call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and allegedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police said.
However, they took the time to change Dengo's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and essentially preferred the welfare of brotherhood to the life of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be revived and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with blunt object in the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been devastated by overwork in the fraternity, and at least one student dies every year due to overwork since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengo's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be responsible and this step is important for the authorities.
The grand jury of Monroe County recommended murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr Menga, will also be charged with assaulting overload and criminal association.
"We want to hold not only the persons involved, but if there is an organisation that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will push them to responsibility also," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national brotherhood to cancel its relationship with the local branches.
This is the situation when the Fed increases interest rates
Growth of rates will come and the bull market will stumble, the yields of bonds will rise and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it'll take.
For the economy specifically offers the history of a small timemaker.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why the US central bank officials stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when higher rates begin, but rather on trajectories as long as normalisation takes place.
There are really more variables in the game.
However, in the end, members of the market can make sure that all the fuss over the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
"The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as the end of the era of 'value money'," said Julian Jessop, a global economist-leader of Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to more common but still low, creating seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has observed in the last about a month, the expected increase in rates can make the air a bit unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There appears to be a trend for the re-stopping of shares 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the increase in Fed.
More specifically, the market in the last 35 years is often the most - about 14 per cent - heading towards higher rates in relatively flat in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent) and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return from the last six cycles 14.4 per cent, according to recent analysis by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's main liability, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares tended to become more significant later in the tariff rise cycle and the return is beginning to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but increases in rates often help her.
At present, the Fed faces certain conditions that have not yet existed and could speed up recession.
Most remarkable is that a crude domestic product close to its lowest point in history when increasing Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 increases in rates since 1950, only twice the nominal annual increase in GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Although it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, it was rarely expected to be maintained when only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, says Atlanta Fed.
Increasing the rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question might arise, "This time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were prepared to grow the Fed all year round and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase at this session, future trade indicates only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the increasing cycles have been in the super cycle of lever effect increase with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far the longest of the Feds have been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are 74 months and we are still continuing.
The steady yield was also volatile because the market expects higher rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what shares are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more apparent in bonds than in shares when the Fed changes the policy direction.
For bonds it appears that yields change immediately after the first arrival of the cycle increase/decrease.
At the end of the bond increase cycle, they fall immediately," Deutsche said.
The strategic Charles Schwab believe that the increase in rates will bring revenue closer between long- and short-added bonds to the level of the curve.
The high-income observatories often work better in this climate, although "we are still careful about the supply of income," Kathy Jones, a firm analyst of fixed pension in Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are on top, the yield curve is flater, the credit spread has spread and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed tightens politics.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US will win after an increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
A large number of debt companies will do worse because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also increase.
"History shows that the "quality" shares tend to overcome within three months of the initial increase in rates," Goldman Sachsve said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balances preceded a weak balance sheet company in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital, as well as low volatility stocks, have also overcame their ratios of lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points), respectable 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of moving interest rates lose the most, Goldman said.
Consumers also benefit from a growing dollar in addition to pure action games.
Companions can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims Member Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham has criticised this station for "studenting"
He believes he's becoming increasingly unrecognizable than his commercial rival.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards and says he's just cheating on the British.
Ambassador Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says neither he is the original idea.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" in Classic FM, claims the senior MP and builds fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove they're doing something that commercial broadcasts don't do.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station seems to be "absolute" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be--I don't like to use the word "cooled"-- but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that are attacking me when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the charge by arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I've learned about classical music on Radio 3 would not like to learn on any other music.
And their commitment to live with music and making music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and putting into operation new works is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, the regulator Radia 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the public than before, because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire for treading on business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and came to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and as distinct?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the September stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "by way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when he was starting a fun series next time.
However, he refused to exclude ordering more future series of The Voice series or spending money on licensee fees on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be on blame
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since the records themselves began in 2000.
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe November Black Friday could be a reason for stopping spending.
For more than a decade, virtual shopping was on the rise, making many British capital streets a city of ghosts.
However, experts argue that there are signs of online sales stagnation and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total August expenditure represented the lowest growth since the beginning of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared to last year.
Experts argue that there are signs of online sales stagnation and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth in the past years and you go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalised," says the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMPG marketing index.
It explains that internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones for buying.
This meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as the sofa.
But now (he grows) somewhat stagnating, and therefore he seems to be receding.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from buying before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average of buyers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and throw away several sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers renegotiate, can keep customers from other purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the sales are done through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the crane in Mecca and the family of Bin Ladina was sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred by the streets of muslim to perform the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of Saudi Binladin Group construction magnate.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of the crane at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims on the street.
Dressed to a certain degree in white, the mourners chose their way and paid tribute to the victims when the first of the fallen got on their last journey to the cemetery in Al-Moais.
The sad message was passed by the holy place, where only a few days earlier the builder had broken through the ceiling of the mosques and turned to the believers.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king punished the construction group of the family bin Ladin over a disaster that also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of a crane in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the launch of the annual shackle.
Saudi officials have already promised that the hose to Mecca will take place and thousands continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group shouldn't have left the crane's shoulder up when he wasn't in service.
The Arab version of the decree, carried out by the state run by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of a fall.
The English disk agency service did not report this detail, but indicated that travel abroad was prohibited to the company chiefs.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to discover what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims konverged before Hadz's pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any declarations of collapsing the crane and no comment representatives were present.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of failing to use the latest security measures and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Tens of cranes surround Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive building effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladina's family has been close to the Saudi Arab ruling family for decades and have been running large construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda Osama bin Ladin was the son of a apostate who was abandoned by the family in the 1990s.
In the midst of a strong wind and rain, the Havária became only a few days before millions of people in the kingdom arrived in a bond that must be enjoyed at least once in life by every capable Muslim.
Officials say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials determined that one million riyals (£ 174.000) would be devoted to relatives killed and the same amount for permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.
Chief B&Q says Eastern European traders working cheaply already in trend
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laura
Number of East European traders trained behind growth
The result is the opening of 200 Screwfix shops focused on traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets all over the country
He worked on Rupert Steiner, top correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are said to lay down hammers and brushes and hand them over to employed Eastern European craftsmen to work with them at home.
If it goes with a hammer or a paint brush, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do handicraft work at their home, according to the head of the company for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laura, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns the chain for domestic needs, claims that a large increase in the number of East European trained merchants offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
The result is that the Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops focused on traders, and closes 60 B&Q outletes.
Mrs. Laura says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better half of them.
Currently, most male workers are male.
She said that there is a need to address growing demographic trends, which show more women's households, which make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Laura says, "There's still a lot of men working in our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
In essence, half of our customers are women who make 80% of decisions on purchases of goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laura, who is one of only five women at the management of companies according to the UK FTSE100 index, also restructured her top team to reflect the equality between male and female directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees including executive and financial directors.
Mrs. Laura says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't difficult to find the good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher reported a failure as in profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the costs of closing the shops.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new shops
A request for a contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is at risk.
"It is equal stomach justice, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
ODS President Zbyněk Stanjura noted that a one-time contribution sounds good, but it would be better in the long term to be in standard valorisation, because it would be reflected in the next years.
"We have the space to find the mechanism that we will arrange," Stanjur said.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marks (ČSSD), according to which it was due to be issued next year over the law.
Marks argued that she would improve the social situation of pensioners who she thought would not be pink.
The highervalorisation next year would, according to her, amount to a budget impact of CZK 5.5 billion and the ministers are debating every stamillion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) recalled that in the past the pace of valorization had decreased.
Reporter Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right of payment in December will significantly complicate and may even make it impossible, he said.
The President of the MEPs of ČSSD Roman Sklenák therefore proposed that the deadline for the Committee to discuss the standard for 10 or 20 days should be reduced, even if the rights were blocked.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should total up to 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to come from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in particular.
In the coming year, pensions should average up by about a hundred crowns.
A contribution should be made according to pension novels by people who will be entitled to a pension in December or part of it.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension in December before it was paid out.
However, they would have to apply for an additional fee in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly eligible for January, with a rise in prices and a third in real wage growth.
This year, it corresponds to a salary of 41.5 percent, and next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent 314.7 billion crowns on retirement pensions last year, which was about five billion more per year.
Expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 per cent of all budgetary expenditure and 46 per cent of all statutory expenditure.
Last year's average full old-age pension increased by CZK 104 to CZK 10.714 according to data in the State Final Account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided for the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 relative pensions.
Jakun's left his political career plans, he's going to go to science.
At the same time, a billionaire in Russian media was almost certain.
In the Council of the Federation, he was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose Governor Nikolai Cukanov, as the candidate of the Government of the United Russia, was to defend his position in Sunday elections with an overview.
According to Russian laws, senators are not elected by citizens, but they are selected by the Governor from the three candidates whose names are announced before the Governor's elections.
After the election, the senator will choose from the three candidates himself.
It was a complication for Jakunina that he had been dead for 20 years in the Kaliningrad area, as required by the law.
Although Kremlin found an exception to Jakunina, he is an extraordinary and empowered ambassador who is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The Czech comedy Theorie Tiger finished filming.
The last drop in the main hero's premeditation is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, whose strength and patience have come to an end.
Grandma - Iva Janjura decided about grandfather's life, age and funeral.
John is clear that he is on a similar road with his wife Olga - Eliška Balzer.
He will remember that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain government over his life - and, as a solution, he chooses to flee from the present, he points to the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted to comedyally capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners did not feel entirely free.
From the beginning it was clear that the main role would belong to Bartoško, with whom he had already collaborated on the Invisible.
Yet, he was told by an actor who appeared in front of the camera after a long pause connected with reconvalescence after a serious illness, surprised him.
We had an arrangement three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And he surprised me that he's probably a vicious sportsman.
He used to ask where he would sit before making another scene.
This time he rode a bicycle, climbed rocks, and even walked on a hill.
And all in record tropical buckets, the director said.
According to Bartoshka, women take a tiger to make him a rabbit in time.
They're feeding him a little bit, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't happen to play the tiger outside the rabbit shop.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film, and he's commenting on it.
His wife, who may have a slight negative effect on viewers, created Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also nice, intelligent, empathic, and she means well.
But at the same time, she's a usurper, and she wants to train her husband to death, and he told Bajgar.
The film parallels the fates of John's married daughters Olina and Alenky - Tanja Vilhelmová and Pavel Beret - and son-in-law Erik and Pepik - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohak.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, coproducers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google, an American Internet company, has promised to provide another up to 5.5 million dollars ($132.6 million) to organisations that help thousands of refugees streaming into Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday Google.org, which is a charitable part of this internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled part of the visit to Teliček for the criticism of human rights violations.
Czech Member of the European Parliament for the movement ANO Pavel Telička postponed his planned Thursday trip to Baku because he was suspended by the Azerbaijani authorities today by the official part of the visit.
According to Telička, this is justified by the EP resolution of last week, which criticises the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan and by which Telička was a co-author.
By decision of the Azerbaijani side, Telička lost the opportunity to speak with the official partners and also to visit political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, explained in the press statement his Brussels office.
He wanted to use the road, which had been planned several months in advance, to meet with Parliament and the representative of the executive and democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, to clarify the text sent to the Czech Republic.
The EP Resolution condemns "the unprecedented repression of civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent judgment on Azerbaijan's opposition journalist Chadijá Ismail, who was suing for the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out the building of its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovskij did not rule out a Russian air base in Syria in the future when he visited Novosibirsk.
We don't have that kind of plan yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia already has a sea base in Syria at the port of Tartus, which has been used rather as a service and logistics centre so far.
According to Russian press reports, from the beginning of August, supplies of Russian weapons and military material to Syria have risen.
According to Moscow, it is an arms shipment resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians are planning to establish an air base near Latakija, which remains for the time being the bastion of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
But Washington is not clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, and American commentators agree.
Foreign Minister John Kerry discussed the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov, their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go to Moscow next week to interpret the concern over the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The Speaker of the White House Josh Earnest marked Asada's support by Moscow as a lost bet.
Russia's policy objectives in Syria are rather unclear.
Moscow, according to him, made its satellite from Syria.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is following rather a long-term goal, but what, according to Ernest, it is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is supposed to be the main theme of Putin's speech at the upcoming meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York, according to today's speculations.
On the contrary, the Russian leader said that the situation in Ukrainian Donbas was not to be discussed at all.
According to today's report, The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out the possibility that President Barack Obama and the Russian president might meet during the UN meeting.
I hear the White House counselors are breaking up so far.
The TASS agency today, with a reference to the words of the Kremlin spokeswoman Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet met Obama on his New York residence programme.
Apply the sesame oil with a gallbladder diet, the hemp helps to strengthen the immunity.
The use of extra virgin oils is a good way to increase the presence of delicious unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits.
When pressed from seeds for colds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladders.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics, the Czech Republic has been the most frequent cause of death for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation affects women mainly, helps with sesame oil.
If you are among Asian cuisine lovers, you must not miss sesame oil in your sleep, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used for the heat treatment of foods and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in a gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids that it contains are a good preventative of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties three times more often than men.
In general, the problems with gallbladder concern mainly those with overweight, who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fat.
Sesame oil can be used with success in a liver diet that is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that the consumption of this oil brings, they should be careful about the goods from exotic foods.
Asian producers often use overcrowded seeds, which have a more pronounced flavor.
Oil thus loses all the active substances, described by Ladislav Hačeký, executive director of Bohemia Oil from Kraslic, Sokolovsk, who produces bio virgin oils pressed for cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our fox can hatch eight kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material will be heated to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil contributes to heart and blood disorders.
The Czech favorite among oils is the sunflower.
Research by Jarmila Hamerska, who led to Masaryk University, revealed that he preferred it in a warm kitchen to 43% of the respondents.
But it's actually not suitable for frying, it's already starting to burn at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, for the flavoring of salads and is especially useful in the diet in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, most of which reduce cholesterol.
In the case of heart problems, care should be taken for the amount of total fat and calories received.
For example, in one spoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a spoon of rape oil there are 99 calories.
With regard to the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore appropriate to touch extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last just as long as it's sesame and hemp for nine months.
The storage in the refrigerator will continue to last.
The old oil is especially known by the bitter tastes.
On the contrary, it's not a bottom-up mess.
It's a sign that the substance has not been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of a technical hemp are classified as so-called superfood, and therefore hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
For this label, thanks to the highest omega content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot produce the body itself, and one must accept them from the food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study of researchers published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while the Icelandics accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the menu as part of a supportive diet to enhance immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about the use of cannabis oil, they don't have psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
It'll sell 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon in the morning.
Grass oil is not tastefully significant, but excellently enhanced immunity, advised Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Oil’s beautiful company.
According to the statistics, Americans are the most vagrant of the nation of barbecuers.
For one household there is 1.4 barbecues.
There are then various barbecue competitions around the world which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs behind.
On the basis of consumer surveys in the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in life did not graze.
The vast majority then grilled several times a year.
In order to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat marinating several hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is most suitable for that purpose and at the same time retains the health of the beneficial substances while grilling?
In general, fat should be saved during the barbecue process itself.
Experts agree that much of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain when consuming oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
This does not mean, however, that extra virgin oils will not find their use in grilling.
Terrible oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When they say meat, experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will immediately get the grape oil.
Amazingly, the flavor of meat and fish adds to it.
In the kitchen there is a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion up to 216 °C.
Thus, even at this high temperature, as one of the few oils retains the health of the beneficial substance, describes the benefits of the grape oil by Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Oil, which belongs to several Czech producers of this vine.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Because of the favorable contents of these substances, it helps to lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
The consumption of grape oil helps to increase our external beauty - because it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps care for dry and broken hair.
The chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, such as for the cooking of salads, but also for the heat treatment of meals.
Thus, it is possible to use two different methods of grilling, marinating, and barbecue.
By marinating meat and fish, we will preserve their juicyness.
Three ingredients must be present during the preparation of the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
We supply acidity with apple vinegar, for example, and we achieve softening meat.
The spices again add a lot of flavor and oil to preserve and deliver the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
It also adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can pass through dark meat.
So the marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how do you proceed?
Extra virgin oils are indicated by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare their food.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method.
This involves mainly flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before the grilling itself, rub the oil, thus preventing the burning of the food.
Preparation of annexes is also an essential part of grilling.
The grilled meat and fish are suitable for practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
For example, chefs from Bohemia recommend hot summer salad.
To it you need: • 1 pcs of peaches • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of salad leaves mixture • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a roll of salad leaves, sliced cucumbers, and a sliced peach to the large cubes.
According to the taste of salt and pepperoni, you can also taste ground chili and soy sauce.
Finally, dig several drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste then you can sprinkle the salad with finely sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it's not only medication that matters, it's also the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complex disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapy, ergotatherapy, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist, and many other specialists.
However, it is not just medical care, for example women with multiple sclerosis need consultation if they choose to have a child, social counselling, housing adjustment recommendations, etc.
Yet, all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can affect the patient in a fundamental way.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work, and the more he does not have to change his lifestyle.
Doctors point out that the passivity of patients releases the area for disease activity.
For example, regular movement has been shown to significantly delay the time when a patient needs a compensating aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not be subject to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is why a site was created Take a chance (www.bezmitu.cz) which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Take a chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, a double saying is that the first thing that a disease starts to treat is that the doctor may have something to do with it.
It's because we have multiple sclerosis medications in an inflammatory stage where the neurodegeneration process is not that strong.
The sooner we hit, the more hope we can stop the disease and delay the disability, MUDr. Eva Medová explains from the Neurological Clinic of the General School Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which most often solves weakness in the lower limbs or imbalance of balance.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain condition, improve walking, strengthen the pelvis, alleviate swallowing or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the particular difficulties of the patient," says MUDr. Martin Kövári, the prime minister of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
Although people with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, it is shown in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, movement activity also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that the patients verify everything they can do, which strengthens their confidence.
"In practice, endorphins are also flooded and people feel good about it," cautions PhDr. Kamila Řasová of the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine of the Faculty Hospital of the Royal Vinohrady.
By affecting the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for our emotions.
That's how we intervene in the psyche and immune processes, and stabilize the disease, it adds.
"These patients used to be so-called "safeguarded, today we know they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaidDr. Pavel Kolář, the advantage of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
The aim of physiotherapy is to allow a person to remain self-sufficient as long as possible, including employment.
Physiotherapeutics therefore cooperate with ergot therapists to make sure that each person gets a compensatory aid to him in peace.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people will be shocked.
They're going through shock, panic, fear.
It has to respond to a huge burden - loss of health.
With this sick soul, we're supposed to go to somebody's house, not try to take everything on our own.
"I work with them so that they eventually come to the conclusion that even with a handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubert from Neurology clinics General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer, Latcoere would not fly the airbuses.
Air production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft is filled with titanium or light and solid composite materials, which can no longer be produced or processed.
However, next to the super accurate, computer-controlled machining machines, next to the autoclaves for the design of composites, you can bump into something as common as mermaids.
In a drum that resembles a sugarcane pot, in a pile of kiln, the edges of the metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are mistaken.
"No one has come to any better," smiles Ivan Dubský, director general of the air door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague Letňanech, the former Flight makes a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world, they supply a door for Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, the part of which is built in Prague, also include passengers in the first and higher class on the top decks of the world's largest airbus A380.
There are also doors full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Precision is the main motto here.
Maybe the moment key lets the company handle twice a year.
If the yellow sticker lacks control records, they should explain to the airbus or Boeing auditors who drive regularly to see if the doors are made according to agreed rules.
Human senses, however, have not yet completely been replaced by advanced technology.
One door to A320 has 1500 rinds.
The insides must shake hand.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of a falling hammer, they'll know if the thread is properly cracked.
The tolerances in which they are moving are minimal.
The filament may rise from zero to 0,13 millimetres above the surface of the plane.
That's roughly twice the thickness of human hair.
A series of trained matter comes into play during the checkup.
When the controller crosses with his finger in a number of threads, he'll know if any of them are out of tolerance.
Then, when he takes the exact deviationometer into his hand.
Flights of food before 1989 program of training military aircraft L-39.
But in 1991, there was no one.
The company had to quickly find new orders.
At that time, she joined up with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the emergency door supplier for model A321.
Talking to Boeing wasn't so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable supplies," Dubsky recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain blocked if Letov did not take the French Latecore Group to the Prague conference of the International Air Industry Association in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, a meeting with the French went off, says Dubsky.
A year later, Latecoere bought a Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
The installation of parts of the doors for A320 started immediately in 2000.
Three years later, the top deck door for A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company built a new warehouse for processing compositions for deliveries to Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecore, we wouldn't be able to get to these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
Partners want a supply guarantee for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubsky.
Last year the Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profits after taxing 147 million crowns.
An exclusive position among aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Since 2000, Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certifications and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the business wouldn't have made any doors to the planes.
To obtain certificates that production processes meet customer requirements, and in repeated checks it is worth maintaining them according to the Dubské million crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and stricter.
We need to train employees, equipment equipment and re-certificate the whole process, adds Dubsky.
Now, the company is finalizing the process for zinc and nickel coating, which will replace the harmful cadmium that has been used for human health.
Although they got the assignment from the manufacturer, then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come in, check the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
One set of samples test themselves in their labs and then compare the results with ours, brings the Dubsky way in which the customers control them.
The reward for Prague companies is long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague race today stands and falls the production of embryos.
For A320 makes half of the total door volume.
It is either impossible or very difficult to replace the Czech Latecoere for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
This does not mean, however, that he can tell himself any price behind the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It shows how many doors will be standing after ten, fifty, stitch made pieces.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price pattern.
If we don't, we're gonna do it, it's Dubsky.
Half the hall, where electric cabinets are assembled for military aircraft A400 M, is empty so far.
But it is a symbol of the future.
A new semi-bottom line for threading and mounting doors for the innovative model A320 Neo is built behind the wall.
The suction will speed up and speed up.
"This is the trend that the installation in aviation is taking away," Dubsky adds.
The waste has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that air companies have so far ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Just a few meters next to the line will be created for complete mounting of doors for the upper deck A380.
It's our parent's strategic decision.
The aim is to shorten production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubsky.
Before that, however, the company must pass the qualification tests for the installation of certain electrical and electronic devices into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, she should also participate in the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company when it can process composites besides metal materials," Dubsky says proudly.
However, in the Czech Republic, latecoere is reached on the edge of production capacity.
There's no other location in Letov's area.
Before the French mother entered, the company had 180 employees.
Now it's 800 and within three years it could still be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing get ahead of themselves, how many hundreds of new airplanes they order every year, they don't have to worry about work.
Although he has contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague Latecore faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay off their loans in glow.
Eventually, Latecore was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, some of their loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors gained a share of EUR 57.4 million in the company by an increase of EUR 37.4 per cent.
The debt of the company has dropped by two thirds, i.e. by 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company has subscribed EUR 222.9 million to the existing shareholders of the new share.
In total, it raised capital by EUR 280 million.
At the same time, the whole group is benefiting from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which accounts for 85 percent of the market share.
The average growth in contracts is expected by four percent per year until 2017.
In the contract book, he has orders for EUR 2.6 billion, which is equivalent to four-year production.
French media claims that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on slippers.
The Czech race in Prague Letňaney is important for groups.
16 percent of the group's sales.
According to the number of employees, the largest foreign branch is the group.
Members supported a larger proportion of the state's coal charges.
The change in mining charges is expected to bring CZK 427 million to the Treasury by more than in 2013.
According to the Government, the revenue of the municipalities should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
About 450 million crowns and a state budget of 150 million crowns were paid to the municipalities in the previous year.
The mining of brown coal was about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns of state.
The novel is also accounted for by an increase in the remuneration from the mining area allowed for mining per thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments should continue to belong to the municipalities to the full extent.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MEPs that the municipalities would receive 14 million to 100 million crowns per year.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Reimbursement shall be recalculated as a product of the amount of the extracted minerals and the rates for each species of the minerals.
According to the government, the possibility of a flexible reaction to the current economic situation is a reason for the change.
However, Ambassador Marek Benda of the ODS warned that the determination of the fee by government regulation may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax case, since the state pays the non-growth that is State property.
Fees shall be paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the city's money and a quarter of the state's money will be delivered.
The same ratio will be found in the case of mining of radioactive rock.
Part of the money that the state collects on mining charges will be purposely tied.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a bane rescue service.
The opposition MPs today criticised the pretext, who claimed in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and the Mayors) warned that the mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they have so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance improves his budget," said David Kadner (Usvit) elected in the Ústice region.
Before the rise of unemployment in Mosteck, she warned the Member of the KSČM Hana Aulic.
Kadner and the Aulics unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted the law to return to the government for processing.
The reason for the report is that according to mining companies, the increase in charges will not be reflected in the price of coal because prices are over 90 per cent long-term negotiated.
The main consumers as power plants or heat plants should therefore not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that a mining organisation will compensate for the increase in remuneration for its efforts to reduce its operating expenditure, which would in particular mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government allows.
However, according to her, the increase in employment charges is a lucrative one.
According to the rapporteur for the novel Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members of Parliament know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government decision on coal mining limits prior to the adoption of the law.
If the coal is going to be worth even the limits, then it will have implications for the state as well as the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the lower Czechoslovak Army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of ČSA should already be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy, according to him.
Time for decisions on interest rates for the United States Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists addressed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates within a range of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been a year since the Feds reduced their rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The American economy was doing quite well, there was recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared for increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see great odds against this step.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday 20:00 CET.
A gunman at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day also his colleague - wrote a message stating that he was "flyed" by the first murders and wishing that he could take it back, revealed on Tuesday's government office.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, stated that Lamb, a professor of geography and social science at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10:00 p.m.
And he said he shot someone.
The lamb dispatcher asked him to send the police to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "loving dog" in the house, who "will not bother anyone" but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb never introduced himself.
Lamb also failed to explain why the house was shot.
When the police arrived at the scene, Amy Prentisse’s 41 - year - old body and handwritten note from Lamb found: “I am so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb set out on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teacher and then took his own life.
University Dean William LaForge said he did not know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was clearly something going on in Mr. Lamb’s head”.
Despite the Monday declaration that Lamb allegedly believed in the romantic relationship of Amy Prentiss and Schmidt, government authorities have stated that there is no "no evidence" about the "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steena and Prentiss was "shuffled" in the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald said, Prentiss worked from the house on the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunter's dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles was heard.
The police said that Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said that he would “not go to prison”.
When police caught him on a highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled to the woods where he was shot.
According to a resume published on the school’s website, Lamb received a Ph.D. in the field of education at Delta University in spring 2015.
Stars That Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was detained for possession of drugs in 2008.
I'm sure all these things are taking their toll.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for a couple of months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the League of Champions against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this injury in tears and expelled him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The wound caused an insensitive procedure by Héctor Morena in 15 minutes when 20-year-old Shaw penetrated the PSV area.
Nine minutes he was treated on the playground and oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture, and now he's in the hospital."
He will be transported tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester when he's 18, it's very hard, but it plays fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in his closet, he also had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group phase.
I believe he'll still play this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalt kick.
Judge Nicole Rizzoli Mexican didn't punish.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalta and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thanks to everyone for their messages, words can't express how destroyed I am, my path to recovery begins now and I'll come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injury to PSV
An English defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of a European championship in France next July.
Phillip Coco, PSV coach, said, "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, each player is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the players, and when you hear about the severity of such injuries, it's not good," Coc said.
I wasn't able to notice this moment.
All I saw was a ball that was heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched him, but I didn't see a procedure for Luke.
In an interview for the SBS6 he said to Moreno: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: When a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't last long before they learn to remember it.
But you must not be David Cameron.
When asked by the provider of children's schemes to name a favorite children's book, the Prime Minister of the Lorax, a fable from Dr Seuss of 1971, chose to do so.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report published on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Smart, touching, creative and strong content, which I liked to read to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had not seen before."
Well, then, after that, in the next paragraph Cameron reportedly described the story of the book by the 2012 video elevator, which added other figures and details to fill out the brief original text.
"In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a wall, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of the girl of her dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," is a brief content of a book that records the object of love of the unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it itself weren't suspicious enough, the text delivered by Cameron was read as a summary elevator of the film Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words: "In Thneed-Ville city, an intrusive wall where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Since he was an open - minded parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not be familiar with the story of a book where an unnamed young man would learn that the local nature is defiled by a robust, strumbling industrialist, Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titled Lorax, twisted, knightly creature who "speaks as trees."
Most likely so relatively little important PR task was given to an assistant who had never read the Lorax child 20 times in a lifetime.
The speaker Downing Street said the text probably came from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without any further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of renunciation of England, but still holding
To compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England chose on this tour, I think the repeat of the 3-0 defeat she suffered last time in a test series is unlikely.
I wouldn't directly rule out winning the guests either.
Alastair Cooka may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in this battering system and collective thinking is strong; they will not take scars from 2012, only youth positive.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth fell out of the team of England in an experience series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is a hard nut for me to analyze, because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks in demanding conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no questions around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement because — and this I mentioned earlier — players are their best selectors.
A few more half centuries, and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more jogging for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
Chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not entirely high, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much time a bat gets to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson in front of him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and out.
The only thing you could say about it is that England gave Jonathan Trott its first chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best form — but this missed opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and he's a bat, and I appreciate very well.
He's the x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field, which he did a little.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this will all depend on the overall composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when Moeen started by Cook's side, who would get another extra spinner while he kept four quicks, she was lifted up, and I have no excuses against her.
I don't understand why a strikemaker can't go off and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests before his 2001 performance.
He immediately succeeded in three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and when I had the opportunity to follow him, I was considered a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a spring, but there are not many spinners that raise their hands, and the selectors decided for the young.
They'll learn a lot about this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardenea, a batterer from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the rehearsal game can be a master move.
He's one of the most beautiful guys who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the white-ball part of the tour and brings both energy and ruthless spark.
I always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and just as Mahela has the intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even though they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes relax and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham Ben Stokes' teammate got a one-day break, just like Root got a similar break from Australia, and I don't have a problem with this decision.
Although many do not agree, coaches and selectors do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts stagnating by 2017.
The unthinkable strategy of renegotiation of David Cameron for maintaining Britain in the EU comes to other problems with every passing day and without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the head of the Workers Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Aliens also have their Corby and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British self-centred agendas, divisive concessions and disruptive changes to the treaty, which they generally did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided not to want to do so even if social protection was in place.
We can even call it selfie agenda Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a picture before the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to take care of Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German carefully balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she was in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with the far-reaching 11-year-old Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also falling.
Poland can soon have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see them breaking their legs with the help of Selfie Brits who could better invest their energy in preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan deliberately useless SNP notes during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, a friend claims.
"Repetition solved the problem" and "Britjania has nothing of value from the negotiations."
Europeans know for their own injury how annoying Fleet Street can be and how skeptic against the EU are oligarch barons because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Ben in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at 2:1.
They can easily remember the name Boris Johnson, a trippy Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels rapporteur "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his embroidery, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of non-payable tax collectors, foreign hacking phones and pseudo non-marginal departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in the cage with a wild gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so she doesn't want to have you for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair had accepted the principle of abrogated EU constitution, which had been drowned by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and gained his card of resignation.
Print never forgave him either.
But the lovely Jeremy Corbyn, who will make me a friendly pat on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he must not waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of reintroducing a boycott strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake even now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, I say nice, developing.
He claims that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the raging trend of the Ucip and the wild shores of Tory Small Englanderism can certainly come to it.
The same was said by Hilary "Bem, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week when his inner scout couldn't afford to admit Corby's appointment as abrasive McDonald as shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting for us to remain "under all circumstances" - Benny's frame - it seems not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to his fellow Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whether the background is any, sensitive image Corbyn wants to tell - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the report remains important for the ages of all-day television and especially in the faith, the paranoia and betrayal of social media
It is fair not to provide Cameron with a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to consider the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign to be self-evident, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonald's and Corby's basic screw-up about EU membership - in accordance with their Bennet surrounded by an economy, an anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion between leftist dissidents, for whom narcism is a small difference in the central essence of dogma gambling.
As with his twisting about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC's campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of all this for their own masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - for British concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the British 'bad military power' in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded of the Monday start of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise the review of electronic published by Public Health England
A government-funded announcement by the agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to tobacco industry, researchers say.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet critic of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE released a "internal" report last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the extent of the data and drew attention to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
The founder in Lancet’s expert journal last month attacked the “immortally remote base” on which the PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who wrote for BMJ questioned the claims that were allegedly "built on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "The fundamental principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They argue that the public could expect that PHE’s claim, which sounds "current best estimate, is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking", is based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to prepare an analysis of the multi-criteria (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which the Director-General allegedly had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also approved the entrustment of public health to BAT in the sustainability report, it states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not from the funding allegedly obtained earlier from Philip Morris International tobacco.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industrial financing in newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting was also attended by tobacco management.
The report created in this group "explainly admits," missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most of the criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE claims that "there is yet no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, stated that the BMJ claims had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of two lifelong smokers will die because of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small compared, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what they do not display, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die of smoking and smoking-related diseases a year, cost NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly stressing current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
The BBC should be done with EastEnders, alleged former CEO of Channel 4
Former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give a right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for putting on public service programs, which will probably only watch a handful of people, in complex broadcast times, compared to his rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he was unsuccessfully trying to connect to BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I am struggling with the idea that the BBC is setting up and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast rivals without the contributions of the state," Johnson said in a communication committee in the Upper House as part of the talks on the future of the BBC.
If you maintain a licence fee that I am not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation of programmes that others do not or do not produce should be reduced.
They broadcast The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, ridiculous.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be financed without contributions.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and, of course, produced on domestic soil.
To be honest, other channels would give them the right hand.
I cannot understand how these public broadcasters are.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at any rate.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC that he felt guilty by catching up with ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those that former Sky Executive Director Tony Ball used his MacTagart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sells the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more rigid BBC public service programmes "goes on to BBC4, where quite often it is not possible to measure the audience, but they fulfill their powers and can argue that when they are preparing for their capricious mission to justify £4bn the receipt from the licence fees, "But of course we do all these daredrous programs that no one looks at."
They're being broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
Regarding the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people who are 150 pounds a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look at BBC so much.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should review its reithov mission in the sense of "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now previously classified as education - it was 1% TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and he should take the example of public broadcasts in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the theme of the partnership Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which only a handful was broadcast on television, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
“Sonogenetics” or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the ankles move.
Scientists raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny ankles change direction at a time when they are affected by sound impulses that are unheard of to the human ear.
The pulses function by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists have indicated that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said for a Guardian diary that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are administered to the patient's brain. The method is used for e.g. to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The ankles usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would be delivered when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As it has been discovered, bubbles strengthen the ultrasonic waves that then pass through the bodies of worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves operate in the ion channel TRP-4, which is located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells to which they are connected, the Nature Communications magazine reports.
In order to control the ankles by ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
Then, when used on such modified worms ultrasound, the sound waves were strengthened by microbubblins and transferred to worms where they turned on modified motor neurons.
In many ways, the new method resembles optogenetics, a pioneer tool that enables scientists to turn neurons on and off with light.
But Chalasani was told that sonogenetics could have many advantages compared to this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired position in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," said Chalasani.
He added that the method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and cells producing insulin.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
adverts stifling the British arms trade.
Take a look at the video about the arms market from Amnesty International.
Horrible killer drones!
Knuckles on the legs that break ankles!
Shots fired!
And electric shivering batons that cause unbearable pain, but they leave no trace!
The joyful voice and cartoon metaphor leave no doubt that this advertisement on the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to oppressive regimes through the defense and security facilities of the International Veselice in the ExCel Centre in the London Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with the opening of posters at bus stops and metro stations, which require a second view.
"The important announcement, Traveling to the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using the letter with the London metro mark with the DLR links becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, the swarm of arms dealers will join the DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The Special Patrol Group collective has helped distribute across London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 for a piece of Allen keys, which allegedly "takes access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London is not entertained by this fleeting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and associate professor at Essex University, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to spectators outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order to have an impact on society.

The Amnesty video was posted on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCP agency working without a claim on the honorary and graphic designer and the commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of the VCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the quiet advertising of the arms trade - saw an empty space in the ExCEL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that tries to avoid."
They played with the creation of more realistic, risky corporate advertising, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, I've achieved that more people are going down."
"They did a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about selling illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the United Kingdom government to take measures and ensure that torture is not dealt illegally with at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantasticly euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army on "on the shoulder of the AT4CS RS."
This includes "a uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects behind armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life on Student College
11 years ago, I moved to college as a disrespectful 19-year-old boy, still believing in bars and moral relativism, but until now, I'm getting the tense smiles of those I've been practicing - and numerous, long-lasting complaints on the other.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to colleges can move slightly to nerves walking up to totally shocking.
It's tempting to talk to people about where you're from, if you took a year off, what you think of Corby and why "really you don't love or exactly hate Marmita, because people, it's just an extract from HAHAHA's yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask and show interest.
It drives the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and the ones you don't talk to, even if your algae are in one fire, and they'd be issuing fire extinguishers.
Let the people have space.
People's rooms often change to drinking receptions, movie nights, and communal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and adjust their underwear.

Introverts in college will be here shortly.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of dormitories change into an extracurricular walk culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It could be hell for someone who needs a charge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to figure out when a classmate is tired of socialization and maybe write him a knock-off.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
A boy in my dorms used to say that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to baking.
Because you started going to university at the top of a baked mania, knocking on a stranger's door and showing with a fence baked cakes seems a little less weird, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile while I ask for personal questions."
Offering homemade lusts is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and perhaps everything will end by assigning your face to a delicious surprise.
Of course, that's the subject of being a cheap baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and fat will likely prevent others from pretending to sleep when you try knocking on their door.
The theft of food is a common crime in student colleges.
The theft of the whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is there a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Double check with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they get mad inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more grown-up than my roommate, who swapped her milk for washing dishes to punish the thief.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make sounds that keep people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decrepit human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could make the drum and bass a little quiet because they were 3 nights and in the morning she had a song.
Their answer was to strengthen the music.
When they finally shut down at five o'clock in the morning, she let them sleep for two hours, and then she played her own music out loud, locked the door and left for her three-hour song.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband went to the same college as you?
On the contrary, it would not be terribly embarrassing if you mistaken your roommates for your future spouse, slept together, separated, and had to see each other every day, and perhaps take control of your mutual friends as well?
Of course, you can't tell your hearts - but if your sexy roommates are not your future spouse, try to talk to your weaknesses a little bit.
At a moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in their unclosed room, there is only a thin border between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and entertaining lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the doors and put the keys in the bottle with water, which you then put in the freezer - but never put their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eve looked forward to twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eve has had a heartening moment in her pregnancy with her seven - year - old Vítek.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
With the situation coming up, I was dealing relatively quickly - I was looking forward to the baby and looking for a positive one.
Insecure and being alone with the baby, I tried not to waste.
And I'm sure I had the hope that we won't be alone for a long time, remembering Eva's first pregnancy today.
She had already met on the Internet at the cottage of an elderly Vázko, whom they began talking to about favorite movies.
Vášek Eva and Vítek even brought home from the womb, but the stepdad didn't get involved too much.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in this 3.
The theme of the third series of the Czech TV series is the search for happiness for a second attempt.
The care of Vítek and the financial security of the family were managed thanks to the part-time work and the great help of her mother and the help of her aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child eventually failed to disapprove of Vaskov’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vitek's second birthday, and he now understands your father as his father, and so he addresses him.
Even though Vášek has two adult daughters, the fatherhood in his 60 ’ s also enjoys and devotes more to children.
In addition to the Vítek, a two - year - old Leontínka came to them, and finally two - year - olds.
"Your family has somehow entered our family naturally, perhaps even by not having a lot of talk to my mother," Eva thinks smiling.
Little room?
At least we're close.
Em and Ela twins were born in the imperial slaughter after Eve’s pregnancy was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis.
This is a disturbance in the production and activity of gallbladder acids, which, in excessive amounts, occur pregnant in the blood and are mainly due to itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn, threatened by premature birth and death, most of which will spontaneously disappear in the mother’s postpartum.
Ema and Ela were born healthy for Evina and your happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emička was placed in an incubator at the Intermediary Department, where she works, and the niece of yours, who was able to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was larger and right after I moved from the IIP to the room I had it with me, describing the demanding period after Eve's birth.
In the womb, she spent 20 days until doctors allowed babies to be released, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting to pick up children in Eve's womb did not work.
"I was a mad pathway to my husband and children," recalls a difficult moment in the six-week department of a four-fold mother.
She and her husband also considered signing a revision, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen in the end, and the doctors released Eve and the twins to home care.
The stories of four pregnancys and childbirth broadcast on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
A large family can be modest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva must have had enough electricity with two cooks and tight conditions.
Although the house did not grow, it made Eve happy to install a gas cooker to make cooking more comfortable for six people.
If it gets any worse, we'll switch for a cab.
Eve is convinced that children are particularly conscious of family well - being and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or demise of the house.
For the time being, we've been putting together a lot nicer than we expected.
Although the mess is worse hidden in a small space, and the peeking baby sometimes crosses, but at least we're all close, Eva smiles, which can find a positive side on any situation.
Your work as an illuminator in the film is not a guarantee of regular intake.
That's why sometimes they go to Prague streets like a cab driver.
In his 60 ’ s, according to his words, his family and children’s finances are physically well controlled, how long will it take?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be once I who will live this family," admits Eva equally when questioning the future.
She'd like to go back to her job, but she's even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
I'm not an employer with four kids.
And if it's worse, my husband and I can switch for a cab, he's joking about a cute blonde.
Apple's affected the yo-yo effect.
There's displays for everything.
The more efficient processor, a camera with more resolution, a tighter chassis or a display that detects the force of touch, these are, in short, the recently introduced iPhones of the ninth generation.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The present trend of Apple was that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous generation.
The exception was only the third and fourth generations whose weight slightly increased compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram mass difference in the non-profit of the novel was indeed negligible.
However, this is far from true for the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams in a smaller model, then 20 grams in a larger way.
One side can't be surprised, last year's affair with bending in Apple's pockets suffered greatly.
The new scale is thus from the more resistant aluminium alloy 7,000, which has also been shown on the weight.
But they have a much greater impact on the display.
Apple used 3D Touch technology to help the displays discern the strength of the touch.
To this end, it was necessary to provide the display with another layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of the new iPhone displays has thus increased more than twice compared to the previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from the original 12 grams per 29 grams, in the case of a larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s, the most difficult component used is the display.
The weight of only 143 grams is then reached in this novelty thanks to the dexterity of the crust, which has touched most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, then the most difficult element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed against the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is seen in the display.
The weight of 5.5" iPhonu 6s Plus is 192 grams.
To the extent that new technology will be available, the screen will show up when it is used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday 25th September, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Are cereal champagne breakfasts for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists managed to find an interesting possibility.
They've discovered signs of settling with modern people from different times, including wall paintings, leftovers of tools and so on and so forth.
In 23A, which according to the tools is dated until about 30,000 years ago, scientists discovered something that very much resembles the rest of the breakfast buffet.
There were traces of oatmeal grains found on site, which apparently passed through the production process of so popular flakes today.
With it, the grains will be wet today, then the dried, ridded of the packaging, the so-called lungs, then burned and spilled in half.
In the cave of Paglicca it was possible to discover grains that appeared to have been heated or roasted, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this is evidence of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, scientists have not been able to demonstrate in their publication for PNAS that there is a complete process of production of flakes in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very obvious.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat the flakes, but the assumption that it was with some fluid and quite possibly even warm is of course offered entirely logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before the establishment of agriculture.
If the sunscreen is correct, the oldest tracts have been preceded by agriculture for about 20 thousand years.
New report of the stations in the Transport Company of Brno City.
So once again I listened to the report of the names of the stop in the trolleybus: Gross, Spectrum, Frazova, Spratcká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so the male voice was a little less understandable than before when the stops came out with a woman's voice.
The woman's voice is higher, so in the deeper volume of traffic, it's better visible than the deeper male voice.
While DPMB argues that this voter was chosen by the passengers themselves - I do not know who, I was asked by anyone, but it was certainly taken from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than in the frame of the bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for several decades, so the correct names of all these stops I know to remember, so I don't need this report, but foreigners who don't recognize themselves in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended may be confused and may be at the end where they've wrongly arrived, then say that the stop they were supposed to go to was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of the speaker - but better again the loudspeaker - should be done again, and this time colored with normal traffic noise and a race engine, in which the speaker's snooping on the bus almost loses.
So that we don't have to keep listening to the names of the water stations, the Šměrová, or then the Pomorna, in the shrapnel that I went to in Komárov.
I suppose my old hearing didn't suddenly worsen so much during the only day that the speaker's stop changed.
I understood the report quite well the other day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the tracker's notes.
Today, few people know what the biggest and smartest parties in the country's governments were so-called complex checks.
I let myself remember that.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office the moment the radio said it was seven hours ago.
"You're lucky you didn't meet with Comrade Chief, came a minute before you and it seems like he's not in the mood," said the dispatcher while I was writing myself into the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Please write to me that I'm going after the precincts for a review of the minor mechanization.
It's not gonna work, it's checking today.
They're all fucked up about it.
What is it, anyway?
"You'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next time you will.
I ran out in the hallway.
That's when the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Uptight, with a stone face, in perfectly falling parallel.
"Good morning, sir," I greeted respectfully and quickly turned on two buttons of the jacket the same way.
"Good morning," answered the reply, and I rushed quickly to the second floor without realizing the cold, sinister tone with which the old man replied.
"You're playing," said engineer Eva, the elderly lady I appreciated very much.
She said she was even chief of staff before the comrades planted her.
There are checks and you come like this.
How many times have I asked what the complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it too much?
They say they have to be there once in three years, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
I'm afraid I'm gonna see it.
I pulled a fascicle from the drawer with periodicals and a phone.
"Here, Holcman, come to me now," the chief's voice answered.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing ... I've mumbled, but no one answered me, just everyone with their thoughts.
"Good day, Comrade Chief, I have come to your order," I fainted, barely entering the chief's office.
The chief was sitting behind the desk looking over some of the papers.
"Second mechanic," he said after a while, without raising his head and still carefully looking at it, "your behavior is not good for me at all."
He threw away the leper on the table, leaned on the back of the chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, pictual look.
I didn't find out.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised me for working very well in my post in the last few months and for being very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the company on the distance.
And now this?
Realize you're a technique of track distance, and that's what you have to act like.
The greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I've been teasing myself that I've been using this kind of greeting since I was a kid, that I've been raised so much and that I don't see anything wrong with it.
To the Chief, it was like a red cloth for a turkey.
"You are on the socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honour of the job," cried the stomped chief.
Plus, you're still confusing the address of your superiors.
One day you'll say "Sir" and the second time you'll say "friend."
But I'm not the Chief for you, but the Chief.
The deputies are comrades of the deputy, the supreme linemasters are comrades of the supreme trackmasters!
Remember that kindly!
I'm sorry, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a common civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and that honor work, or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It is not your advantage that you are not on the side," the cold said the chief, who in the meantime calmed down a little.
It's still going to be discussed.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a pension prepaid chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his preference, it didn't look good to him.
For a while, he stabbed me with a cold, dusty look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also annoyed with his high-pitched tickling.
He was only a few years older and he was playing God, actually, comrade god.
Squirrel, horny, authoritarian, arrogant, how he's been able to do it right now.
They all yelled at him.
Be that as it may, he's the chief.
In fact, not all, the chairman of the party organization, like all the cowards, but also the non-strategists, he did.
But the Chief was yelling at many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
He just shot me for total bullshit.
I've been thinking about my ass, and I've had enough of a beating to keep it from shooting him in the face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the shoplifter's bar, let alone to keep working as an officer.
What would I use two kids for?
And a house built for it!
I was crying, but I did it.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," ended an audience chief and began to look over again carefully the lister that he had in his hand before.
At midnight, I was summoned.
Everyone in the office was there, and they were asking what and how, they said, "Yeah, it's gonna be okay."
Only Jožin boldly spoke, as he used to be, that they couldn't throw us all out, because the job would have to be done by the chief himself with his faithful, and that he didn't threaten.
The word "suspect" was emphasized, as if he knew what the old man had shot me for this morning.
There was a lot of fun in the chief's office.
Comrade Chief, behind his desk, and at the long consulting table, other comrades who were to decide about my official existence or non-existence.
Kadrawak, president of ROH, writer of staff, special purpose reference, something about a way of countering the war, and the deputy, my boss.
Also the most important person, chairman of the party organisation.
I knew him from Thursday.
An ordinary track worker, submerged with a slingshot or a fork of gravel.
But also an ex-guard.
It's been heard that there was no fun with him at the time, I hear, a pretty beast.
Bad languages said the school went out in seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't know anything.
And when the crime broke down, he ended up at the cracker's office.
But, comrade, yes, the comrade was stoned!
Chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little soul in my neck, an incorruptible ham.
Kádrovák read the report from the Civil Committee from his place of residence.
I come from a labor family, I'm married, two kids, and so on and so forth.
It's okay so far, I've been thinking, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then a report from the street organization.
He copied the report from the Civil Affairs Committee, and maybe they're both written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of long-term members of the party refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently resigned, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me very hard.
The fireman noticed and stopped reading.
Chief said he should go on.
It's been a lot worse.
I was a member of the SSM Urban Committee and was obtained as a candidate of the Party.
Regardless of the parents who stepped out, the party gave me confidence.
But I married and married except on the National Committee, I also had a church.
I failed the party's trust in the worst way possible.
That's why I've been crossed out of the ranks of her candidates.
But it wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I set up a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
By doing so, I show a negative attitude toward the party's leading role.
When the cadre reads, only tapping the chief's pencil into the tableboard interrupted a tight silence.
Everyone looked up at me, and I wished I'd been far away.
And I kept saying, "Communist - superhuman, Communist - superhuman." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I was able to repair the wearouts without any fucking checks.
But now?
She took the career of an officer before she started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think that's gonna work, but I'm sure the chief's gonna be out for an hour.
"Second, how did you examine the discussed comrade here?" interrupted the tense chief's question on the cadaver.
Well, according to the previous employment report.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, the fireman wasn't over two times.
He's got sweat on his chests, he's got a nervous snooze, like he's been tested himself.
He snuck in and gave the chief some paper.
"Well," said the chief with a sign of greed, which was often the forerunner of the storm.
At first glance, the praise itself, taught with distinction, studied the industry, worked in the task force as a locksmith, averaged a hundred percent.
But it's not important.
Where did you get that judgment, comrade?" he turned again to the Cadreman, who felt that somehow it began to turn against him and that very soon he might not even have to be a chaplain.
This is where my comrade gave it to me when I got in.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came up to us, he went to the precinct to the platoon," the fluttered.
And there's no need for reports, and he was an extra one, so I put him in the file.
"So, when you were placed in the technical function, you had enough paper," the sushi stated the chief.
The cadreman was nervously snooping, and he had no response.
"Never mind, we'll talk about it later," the chief closed the matter and apparently relieved the Cadrek.
He's stopped it for now.
"So what's the matter with you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
She's yelling at me all of a sudden, so it's over!
It was dark in my eyes, hot in my eyes.
There was a flow of remorse and accusations, and I knew that I was the most repugnant creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That I had mistakenly misjudged the comrade of the cadre reporter, and I did not understand why the assessment was incomplete when I got it from the pulpit in the factory.
I was also antisocialist, who, at the time of building real socialism, supports the realm of religious darkness, and even participates in them.
That there was a lot of what I'd done, or maybe I'd still do it, and I'd pray quietly for it to end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I left the mechanic's seat.
I didn't care if they took the crumb too.
It's a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the chief's comrade.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," the chairman of the party said, and sharply interrupted the chief's Levites.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he just did some stupid thing!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than closing the door to his side for a while!
To open up to him again, he'll have to prove that he's changed, that he's worthy of our trust again.
An untrained caretaker spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he that read-out or papouchal frat from party training and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
Chance to prove he's changed.
And who's to give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young man, the truth, a somewhat mistaken comrade, in his efforts to remedy him!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of you!
Actually, it's a party duty, too, for all of us.
This is where the comrade needs to see that his side hasn't forgotten.
That like a kind mother not only punishes but also loves her.
When the president finished, no one even looked.
No one expected such a reversal.
At least I did.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade President," the chief was on ice trying to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me talk, you'd have heard that I was heading to that conclusion.
They all gave a favorable voice, but they could see that they didn't believe him a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate reference to care for basic means," I cried when I returned to the office and cried back.
Except for Eva's engineer, they were all at lunch.
Those silences listened to my unrelated treatment of fresh experiences, and in the meantime, I calmed down.
When I was done, she asked if I could get coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she built water on a cook and was planning pots.
In the meantime, there was talk of incense practices.
Like one opinion, often full of praise, they put a person in hand, and the other, where there is dirt, they send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I had it, but at the shopkeeper's counter, so comrades at the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadaver?
He's just old enough to eat or drink, and that's how it ended up.
"He's got it from the old man," she remarked maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Look out for him anyway, he's pretty vengeful.
And the party president?
In fact, a much worse chief, no populous.
Zero from a grumpy with a lot of power.
The water on the coffee began to boil, and the return of the office filled with the smell of coffee just poured out.
I threw a sugar cube into the pot and the milk was stirring a hot potion.
I hope I'm from the worst outside.
Now they won't fire me, and other checks are in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief, I'm not going to forget today.
It was done in the anthology of the TRATI II literary literature in the Epika publishing industry.
The symbol of the village's veins.
The windmill above Chlum has been rolling again for years.
You can see far, because it's located 15 meters high.
People from a wide area call it the "Chlum's Wind".
For the municipality, 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal sign, which the municipality gained for the occasion of the births reunion in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at that time, and the windmill, of course, we wanted to have it on the sign, everyone knows it around," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It's a little bit of a memento of the present: it reminds us of the time when people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chum last century was a rare thing.
Up to 1910, the umpteenth - century representatives of the group decided to do so until the mid - 1980 ’ s.
In the village near the branch in Chichov, they had a well of seven meters deep.
Three years later, the well was supplemented by a metal structure with a wind pump that was pumped into the reservoir at the highest point of the village near the church here.
"The building was performed by Antonín Kunc from Hranic on the Morava load of 2,400 crowns," says a memorial inscription on the ground-floor fence construction.
After several repairs and the fall of the wind wheel, he served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of water fighting began to be written: that day a new plumbing began to be used in Chlum.
The wind pump has already remained only a non-functional general symbol and the rarity here.
The Dominant was operated at this year's rodeo reunion.
Until 2008, the Chlums decided to repair the windwheel again and bring it back on track.
They had to produce a replica of the original wheel - reduced on average by half a meter.
The wheel was placed on a mast, but it had to be carried down that same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not select suitable material and the wheel could not resist the waves of the wind.
After that, the imaginative Dominant rested under the roof for several years.
Since June this year, however, the wheel on the high mast has been rolling again.
On the occasion of the reunion of the parents, the village had a replica of the wheel adjusted and again placed it on the top of the iron tower.
But the bike only draws the useful water from the well to an ambushed blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we pulled him off completely because there was little water in the well.
At least it was spinning.
"In the fall, we will disconnect the windwheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlom is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the windmill has reached the municipal sign, but it is the only village of this species in the whole of the Highlands.
They have a similar feature in the sign in honour of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Green Hora in Vyškovsk, Kuželów in Hodonín, Partutovice in Přerovsk or Police in Větínsk.
Not bad, but I don't know Lafat, she confessed to Tripoli Goian.
"A match against Slavia remembers very well, even my goal, as everyone in my career," smiled 34-year-old Goian at a pre-war press conference.
That's when George Hagi trained us, it was bad luck we lost.
I hope to score Sparta now.
Only with the difference that we do not lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 matches for the Romanian team, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a tracker, he'll face the raids of the spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, he's talking about a Greek battle against Hybsh's partner.
And partially knows what he's got to be waiting for on Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in Romanian Astre with my brother Lucian.
That's when I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good assailant, which is why he went to Sparta, called Goian.
Another footballer from the Prague club didn't name him, so the direct question came as to whether he knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled, and with a slightly read view he focused on Czech journalists.
The helpless expression in his face meant, "Why do you ask me that?"
He shut down after a while.
We've seen some videos and I've noticed Sparta plays a lot of teamwork.
He's got a really good player.
And Lafat?
Not bad, but I don't know anyone else but Fataie.
The Spartans know about Goian very well.
"My experience with bigger clubs, you can say that he holds the defense of Asteras, he's such a game organizer," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Even though Goian has the best years in his life, he can boast of a very interesting football resume.
In his time, he was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both United and City Manchester units, but Steauy headed for the Italian Palermo, played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, he says.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European Cups, sings about winning in the Czech League.
For me, he's a favorite in this game, but we play at home and we want to start a group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we'll try to win, said Goian.
I am in the room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who enjoys a lot of competition from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entry to the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the seat of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the project are mostly legal and administrative and have no real impact on the activities of the company, says Daniel Buryš, the financial director of the Kofola Group.
"As regards the transfer of the seat of the group of shareholders, shareholders consider the location of shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Exchange of Securities, Prague is finalising a prospectus that will be presented by the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of holding offices and related transfers of shares will take the form of a non-public transaction involving only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no public or new investors will be offered shares in this operation.
"A random offer of shares to new investors would take place - if so the company and its shareholders will decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
The test of objectivity of Czech television in information on the migration crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance reporting of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time the main news release of Czech TV.
And how was she?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can start today's broadcast of Czech TV Events.
The migration crisis was dedicated about 80% of the coverage.
Up to the first minute when the Czech Republic informed about the unrest at the Serbian-Madriatic border and the attacks of migrants on the police, it called them euphemistically suffering - throwing stones and attacking metal bars), the current promigran propaganda has already taken place - examine the names of individual reports yourself.
Criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large area for non-profit organisations that criticise mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat but also as a chance.
Traveling fugitives - ČT consistently uses the terms runner or fugitive and not migrants.
Most striking is the fact that the Czech Republic uses only small children and women’s images in illustrative pictures.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of migrants detained in the Czech Republic were men.
Summary: For the majority of propaganda, which does not have the same kind of communist agility.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once got wet for a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
I've moved in with fishmen to the closet.
Domestic fish, insects with a change of imperfect, i.e., not processing that rebirth from the caterpillar to the beetle and young looks like an adult individual, but it is small and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't lick them.
First manually and later chemically.
Socialist drugs provided some blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, it has been successfully eliminated.
Later, I dealt with Pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with some Juvenaliser that the ants brought into their nest and then he wouldn't let the queen generate a new offspring.
But that's what I turned away.
As the time went by, the insects also became an object of my admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from my life that interference in the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace another.
Truth about fleas and puppies I wouldn't have unpacked my karma by killing them.
In the new apartment, my partner and I agreed that if we don't get our fishers to climb our necks, let the shells eat off our skin, some invisible algae and the like.
Their peaceful existence has over time disrupted the spider.
It was a common type of torturer who had long settled on the ceiling.
We thought he lived from occasional flies and mosquitoes, which just made us more comfortable.
Because he spent several years with us, we found that he was feeding mainly on fishermen and that he apparently maintained his numbers on a life - threatening number.
We found out that it was a female by a trusted regular contact with each need made.
For we were witnessing romantic talks with a partner about a third less than gently threading the spider’s fibers so that it would not be eaten before reaching a longing for copulation.
It took about three days for them not to move or react to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where love games were played, we later found the remains of a dried female next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by a number of small spiders hanging around her.
They're gone soon.
They were eaten by their mother, and they went to different places in the work.
Even a female disappeared for a week.
If she went away or passed away, we don't know, but after months, two, she came back on the ceiling.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the former toilet dweller.
For some time from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behavior and, by moving under the toilet bowl, assessed our non-attack as friendship.
The numerical condition of somewhat multiple ponds has decreased again, and the spider has been quietly looking for its normal activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed in a year.
Our daughter has grown up to the age when the use of a nightstand has been a shame.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've eaten forever.
We urged her to use the toilet more and more.
However, the daughter found an excuse in that spider for maintaining her habit, which she had seen very well in the exercise.
Our story about the spider being seen, the luck of my mother's house never took.
She made her nightgown cry and cry.
There wasn't any left.
There was a time when the spider had to report, in the interest of the daughter's developmental shift.
It's left to me.
He was caught in a glass and put through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I used to hang out with him as a friend, but after so long a time, I felt like I was throwing away a relative.
We assumed that fishers would start to appear more often and multiply geometrically.
World wonders, weeks, two, none of us showed up.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if there was any kind of ant-like spider that wasn't growing there that the toilet environment was not as favourable to their existence as we thought it would be.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were crawling again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I realized that their connection to the spider must have had a reason not to see it hidden somewhere else and that they were in danger from anywhere else.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator and its rapid disappearance in them triggered some kind of an alarming reaction.
More like I'm not making any illusions about their eyes.
There was some kind of light that was kind of flashy, but that they'd react to waving their hands or moving fast, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's already forgotten her nightgown.
All we have to do is attract some spider again.
I'm already sending my wishes to the ether, and I hope they didn't leave me behind after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that Cyclone B.
The tenor of Albert Einstein's statements that enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist of the past century may never be fascinated by mankind.
He managed to sink into everything so deep that it was always a staggering discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
It was primarily his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic way.
Its explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of quantumising the electromagnetic field cannot also be overlooked.
There is no doubt that the self-discryption and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complex for many that it prefers easy comparisons for closer knowledge.
But it is not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he hadn't found this a genetically simplified form of explanation: the hour near your beloved seems a minute; a minute in hot kiln seems an hour - and that's relativity.
I've allowed myself out of his entire pack of famous quotes to pick out those ten that literally caught me.
Smart people try to solve problems, brilliant people try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one that can prove me wrong at any time.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table reflects the mess in the mind, then what does the empty table reflect?
I don't know what he'll be fighting in World War III, but in the fourth, they'll be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect him.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to handle the problem my life would depend on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analysis and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive myself not to introduce Einstein's formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula is: A=X+Y+Z where X is a job, Y rest and Z is to hold the tongue behind the teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín region are waiting for a change of 1.5 billion.
"It's a success to consider that all four stick together in black numbers this year," said Heitman Stanislav Mišák.
The total profits of regional facilities are currently about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher remuneration than insurance companies which are equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
As a result, the Uherské Hradiští and Zlín are headed towards buildings that together will cost nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
The long time we've been buying machines is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top health care is impossible, justified the plans of the regional deputy for Lubómír Nečas.
He's looking forward to the changes in every hospital.
The builders will be coming to the hospitals next year.
In Vetín, suppliers of a new internal pavilion are now selecting for almost 300 million crowns.
They've got a scheduled dialysis facility in Perkrez.
The Uherské Hradiště wants to bring in a new internet for about 200 million people this year to an open central pavilion.
A long-delayed construction of a new central income and an internet facility, which will require three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is the major and often biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said Veera Prousková, an internal hospital director for the entire region.
The five-storey building there is supposed to be ready in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and an intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that are widely known to patients will affect all regions.
The new buildings will be replaced by those in which, for example, there are many sick people on one room, there is only one toilet on the floor, the beds are inconclusive, the windows are non-touchable, and health care professionals do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our intern was built fifty years ago and is now on the verge of his life," said the director of the Vlinj hospital Pavel Calabek.
Therefore, within a few years it will be replaced by a seven-story modern building connected with an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency wards in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model already has half of the finished Uherské Hradišče.
Central income's already standing, and within three years, he'll be boarding.
"We will pay the building from credit and partly from our own funds," explained Director Petr Sládek.
This hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profit is still high, and it didn't get to the loss two years ago, when, for example, the Grind Hospital faced nearly two hundred million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, raise income and efficiently manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Improvements are also awaited by patients in the non-circuit hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, he will go into repairs, new appliances and reconstructions of up to half a billion crowns.
Already this year will be finished repairing the capture station, then will begin the construction of the dialysis facility, or the construction of the building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains that the other Czech countries are pushing for the adoption of quotas for the allocation of refugees, but rejects any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic when they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not get the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told the journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position you have come to the meetings of the Ministers of Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We don't agree with mandatory quotas as a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migraines like saline bags or flour.
They're living beings that have visions, they're going somewhere, they have relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we were able to maintain migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not get the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we're saying this is the way.
But say the quotas solve everything?
We've dealt with forty thousand recently, and now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When's five hundred thousand?
And how are we going to keep these people on this territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Nobody wants to see us, we just don't know how to hold them.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others, who take the Czech Republic as a target country, have the ambition to come to us, but the interest of people from this migratory wave, namely Syria and other countries, is marginally close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't even want to see us, but 15 hundred people have already made a commitment.
Couldn't it have been possible to accept them this way any more?
We undertook to accept 1,500 people, but with conditions.
We said functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even those 1500 are about 1,100 people coming in to handle asylum procedures.
They'll come into our detachment facility and we'll treat them as much as we did the ones we picked up.
It is a big question, and we will be debating this with Europe if we can hold people registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe behaves so that, if they are registered, they cannot be detained.
That means they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it can happen that we will not even keep the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to Germany when they arrive.
If we can hold them during the asylum procedure, we can handle the asylum procedure with them.
If it is Syria's, Eritrea's citizens, they receive international protection from almost 98 per cent of European statistics.
Then they will receive documents that allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will move in.
This is the second project that is under way so far, and there we have only progressed in discussing with the churches the possibility that they could help them get employment, accommodation and so on.
But it's a run on a very long line.
You said the other states were not willing to discuss it at the ministerial meeting with us.
But is it not that the Czech Republic merely rejects quotas, but does it offer no solidarity to unlock the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is supposed to be a solid step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany makes an incentive that all Syrian migrants can join them, this report is distributed in hours throughout all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's another migratory wave that goes to Germany because they just don't want to see us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders - just to discourage the migratory waves, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Make it clear they don't have a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovos came to Germany last year alone.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturas of this state, including police, courts, state attorneys.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, 50 percent of what the social systems are giving them in vain today could go to refugees.
In contrast to the first day Germany introduced checks, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
It's 80 now, the first day was twelve.
Where does this come from so as to tighten the border controls?
We were afraid of being caught in the order of hundreds of people.
These are numbers that we can handle.
We still have a few hundred seats available in stone detection devices.
Of course, all the people we're going to keep, we're going to return to Austria in seven days.
We're doing it standard.
The Soviets are the only ones who take these people from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where's the fracture point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacities enough for crisis plans to take place.
Then I agree with the Prime Minister that he would call an emergency government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact a few times a day.
If the situation arose, the government could take a de facto session immediately, and one resolution would decide to strengthen the police on the military, let's give the customs administration, or the prison service.
The local variant is the exceptional condition that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think we can get this far.
Realize that our position is different, we are the national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen in order for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread any news.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the migratory flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean direct travel to Austria.
The Czech Republic would touch it very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of her debt for the last minute.
He's trying to prevent a report of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid off her debts.
So did the football players.
Football Slavia stood on Tuesday for the first time because of insolvency proceedings in court.
Nearly three months after receiving a proposal from Online Services from Pacific Samoa for about 20 million crowns.
Lawyer Slavia Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl within a few hours that he should not declare his failure over Slavia.
And I have to say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, the money came from the new owners to the club, at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the Supreme Club on Monday, only the day before the court hearing, sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
"All was paid between September 11th and September 15th," said legal representative Slavia Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
For example, to the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or Czech publisher Maria Ličko.
Slavia also paid Alexander Losenick's fee.
On Friday, the club also paid debt charges to the city section Prague 10.
Thus, part of the insolvency dispute remains de facto only claims that Slavia dispels.
According to the club, the obligations did not arise or are subject to legal disputes.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in case of a loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can document with an account statement," Judge Mládková told her.
"All that was paid after the maturity is paid," said Mládková and added that they were not covered only by irreparable or disparate obligations.
It is also true that, in the coming days, the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid those debts.
The next step is to evaluate all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of the hearing on the third November.
However, the decision shall not be taken at this meeting, but in writing after it.

FastMig X represents the newest generation of inverter welding resources.
The combination of high-quality technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into modular construction brings benefits and a rapid return on investment in the form of high-quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
And any kind of welding of steel after welding of special alloys, as well as welding of rough materials after welding thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in boats.
The incredible amount of welding curves, the simple setting and expansion of the welding source allows usability to respond quickly to changes in requirements, resulting in a reduction of the gaps, the need to change the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X allows welding by top welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality welding.
Time is running out of time and there is no waste of material or repair of faulty welds.
Flexibility is guaranteed, there are fewer gaps, more welding and higher profits.
It's a novelty this year that had a premiere in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these tributes very much because they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X belongs to the world's top.
For the interested parties, it is certainly nice also to add the time limits that move around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already made the first contacts, which will certainly expand after the Brno Fair.
We have been his regular participants for more than 20 years, and almost always, our business results are better after him than before, emphasises the company ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi shop in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blank went to build it so it wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from a company that designed the tunnel.
Blanko went down safer, says the expert.
The Blanca tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there are no two ruins of the land in the Prague Stromovce, claims the manufacturing director of the company Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday night at a press tour of the tunnel.
But he thinks it'd be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
Drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel went down safer, but costs rose exponentially," Butovich said.
The conditions in Stromovka were the same all along, yet the country collapsed only a few steps away from where it began to fight in a safer and more cautious way.
"If this measure had been applied 500 metres earlier, it would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovich said.
The Blanca Tunnel collapsed three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovce, and in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostast Jiří Bělova, the tunnel was too expensive, said the week Euro.
According to the original purpose, the building had 17 billion crowns.
When we add to this VAT, which has doubled during the construction period, you have eleven billion of them.
When technology, land purchases and engineering, valorization and similar items are added, it is 29 billion, which is no longer so far from 37, Whitehead said.
Somebody ordered that and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with a new Apple update
A new operating system can be requested in Settings when you click on the "General" tab and choose "Software Update" (software update).
When ready, your phone will offer you the possibility to download and then install it.
Some users have encountered a problem after installation, specifically with the error message "Update software failed".
One solution to this problem is to wait for an interest in updating or to try it through iTunes.
The phone will update you through the process.
And this including the need to uninstall the site release apps - this will not be necessary, however, because Apple has reduced the update and also facilitated the whole process by using a special tool that will be proposed by the user to delete and reinstall after the update has been completed.
Make sure your phone is loaded before you start updating.
If the battery's condition is low, Apple will not allow an update to be started because the process could cause an update error.
Other news: iOS 9 was not delayed despite WatchOS delay; iOS 9 review: exciting update of the new version of the operating system; iOS9: how to prepare for the release of the new iPhone operating system

FedExu profits mixed, reduced fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfactory results in the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of annual profits due to low demand for freight transport and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holiday season.
During this period of last year FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Company shares decreased by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before mid-term opening.
FedEx states that it expects a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 for a fiscal year that ends next May, which means a 20-cent decline in the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced view comes in spite of an average increase in interest rates of 4.9 per cent, which is shown in January. 4, and higher ground transport charges for heavy or large packages beginning in November.
The company stated that it was still expecting profit growth compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher incomes and growth in online trade.
The chairman of the board and Director-General of Fred Smith said that the company "produced firm performance despite less than expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and global trade".
The holiday plans were announced the day after the rival UPS indicated that it plans to hire 90 000 to 95 000 additional workers, which is about as much as it hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit for the shares was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Markets grew by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts questioned by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years FedEx has been affected by the decline in priority international shipping, which has led to the stagnation of revenues in its Express Unit.
But boom online shopping strengthened the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29 percent, but the operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profit fell in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In the pre-trade trade about an hour before FedEx's share was opened, it fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 percent per year and 17 percent under the 11th of June record.
At its most unexpected session for years, federal reserve legislators will spend this week for two days sitting at 27 feet of a long Honduras mahogany table and will decide whether after almost ten years it is time to increase the key interest rate.
At the end of the central bank's ornament, the two-storey meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to give the nation economic interests over everything else.
The Central Bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize American employment and keep the prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognised that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third period of operation could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to launch in the form of almost zero short-term on-the-spot interest rates from the end of 2008.
Although most data show strong growth in the economy, recent turbulence in world financial markets could already scare the Fed to add to the instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - even by nothing more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for a excuse for not increasing the level, an increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient reason to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.
About half of the economies recently questioned by Blomberg anticipated an increase in the rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to hold back, with a key indicator only about 30% of the chances of an increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rates, only if politicians make a clear failure by vowing that further increases are not in sight.
On Tuesday, Dow Jones' industrial average jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The assembly was set up to expect Fed politicians to hold their rates in peace this week, says John Lonski, the main economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed now raised the rates," he says.
If Fed politicians would do that, "they'd have to go to the extreme in their programme statement and hold the hands of the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts claimed that increases in rates would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the right track to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that over spring and early summer he expects higher rates this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation has slowed in August, the labour market has seen strong growth this year.
The rate of unemployment fell to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of uplift.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank's 2% target of the year, Fed politicians argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the closeness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to decline at the end of last month after China decimated its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones dropped by 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market slightly bounced this month, and now Dow loses only almost 10% of the May maximum.
A comprehensive calculation of the increase in the interest rate shall be added to the political factors of the Fed.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, there would be a tightening of this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA leading researcher Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data on which to rely on the latest developments in China," said Oliner.
The health status of the global economy is not one of Fed's main interests, so it should not be technically included in their decisions.
But in fact, the Fed has become the currency authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The only sign of the then president of Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "use" their monetary expansion on the market triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, it can be expected that Fed leaders are watching developments elsewhere, but they are also advising other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Carabelle, the head of the global strategy for Envestnet Inc. wealth-management.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "The Fed has a history of excessive movements in financial markets that seem to be unrelated to economic foundations."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy making of the Federal Open Market Committee, who pressed for higher rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led to a reduction in its reference rate of 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions of "Although the limited identifiable impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed's representatives reversed these strangulations.
Fed should favour financial stability concerns only during the major crisis, as was the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Committee setting the rate at Bank of England.
The latest convulsion is not even close to this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets have become disillusioned," said Posen, President of the Institute for International Economy Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinese Quarter
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/stock is the only contact place that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian refreshments, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need some motor oil.
Business is massive and it'll take you over an hour to get through all the alleys.
If you're hungry for all the shopping, go to the LAX-C BBQ Express food.
The interior office (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various selection sites.
What is in the warehouse: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
In LAX-C, you'll probably find it.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
Mass spread is big, for example, fish - the employees behind the counter will wash you and skin you, even fry you if you want to,
A good part of the shop is left to a massive freezing section where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, free retail semi-carpets and more.
Who buys here: Owners of restaurants and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Wide streets come out to meet shopping carts and elevators.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the treasury stand.
Where it is located: Shop is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of the Chinatown and the center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways will stay with the old one.
The acceleration to 150 km/h The House rejected.
On selected motorway sections, it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to proceed to the Senate's amendment, which rejected the increase in speed.
The new Land Communications Act will now go to the President.
In late April, President Miloš Zeman said that the law would allow for a speed of 50 miles [50 km].
Against the increase was also Minister of Transport Dan ¡ok (for ANO), according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such a speed.
On Tuesday, before Members, he supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved amendment will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, in particular four currents.
The House first extended this option to motorways on which it would be possible to ride in the selected sections at a speed of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now agreed to his proposal.
The senators agreed with the Minister of Transport to remove the right of transport police to have the last word in adapting the local communications that the municipalities care for.
The shadow version approved by the House also means that the sewer, water supply or public lighting cables can be stored on a longitudinal basis below the surface of the trolleys.
The villages would be spared for the purchase of land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
It is also designed to help improve road protection and facilitate the handling of detached vehicles by the owners.
Newly, municipalities could sell detached vehicles which will not be registered within a six-month period following notification of the withdrawal of their owners.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight through their territories on second and third-class roads under the threat of fines for freight companies as well.
The new option of introducing electronic road signs instead of existing paper stamps, which will be used after 1 January next year, is also denied.
According to the government, it saves money to set up an electronic system.
The oral exprimator is going to court.
He's 10 years at risk for an overexcited welcome from his fellow countrymen.
The case relates to an allegedly exaggerated project of Visiting Citizens.
The police wanted to pursue Zuzana Kailov (ČSSD) in this bail, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it.
According to legal qualifications, there are up to ten years in prison.
The main treatment is scheduled for two October days.
According to D.A. Mandík and Macík, at least one million crowns were damaged, resulting from the prosecution.
The applicant is based on an expert opinion.
The former members of the city’s leadership, according to the applicant, have unlawfully made it possible to obtain the valuable benefit of the company that organised the greetings of the citizens.
Mandík, on the prosecution of the then chief of the department of municipal services, education and culture, ordered him to address five of the companies involved in the selection proceedings.
When another company applied to the competition that offered the lowest price, the competition council cancelled.
The contract was to be entrusted by the city to the administrator, and only Darothore applied to the competition, which the City Council then awarded the contract.
The city paid at least an extra million.
Both charges are conducted to ensure that Darothore is awarded a public contract for the organisation of events Visiting the Citizens in Ústí nad Labem in the long term and have acted in coordination at least contrary to the requirement of the procedure with the care of the proper manager, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, he said they were aware that, following the acquisition of the contract, Darothore would charge Ústí nad Labem for the execution of the events.
In three years, the company recorded more than five million crowns for the project.
The city eventually paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was, according to the expert's assessment, at least one million crowns were overstated.
Mandík had already rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this constructive causation, he said before, that the city under his leadership had only been connected to a similar project from the past years.
From 2008 to 2010, the Roxy II Agency provided the event.
"It was on the same terms, on the same money," Mandík added.
The criminals were also originally going to accuse Mrs. Kailova, who was also a member of the council of the city.
The Chamber of Deputies did not hand her over to the prosecution.
The criminals have therefore deferred the sentence in her case, but they are counting on Kayla to be charged after her parliamentary mandate has ended.
The greeting of the natives was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children’s needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly let a dog escape.
Then they made the press delete the record.
According to the Hungarian police at the border with Serbia, a cameraman from AP had briefly detained him and forced him to delete the record on which a police dog allegedly hit the land of a fugitive.
The Hungarian government, however, is questioning this charge.
The alleged incident took place on Saturday night, when cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia across the cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
Police officers marched against the fugitives, and one of them had a Syrian attack a dog with a basket on its face.
The dog of the man who screamed "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," said Muzi.
The fact that Muzi is filming everything, he noticed one of the cops, and he wouldn't let him go.
Then the journalist could no longer telephone his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Muzi's officers took a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
This was the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt like he was in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP Agency sent a protest letter to the Hungarian government of Zoltán Kovács.
The behavior of police officers in him was unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not have to fear that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács, with his call to the police report, questioned Muzi's timing of events.
He said the cops just wanted a journalist to show them if they were on some shots, which they're entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't make him do anything.
"The dogs can bark--they're trained to scare and a little nervous, but they didn't attack with certainty," Kovács says.
Unpredictable Champions League.
Winning City kicks us, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," shook Manuel Pelegrini's head, hometown coach.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic match for the League of Champions.
Not a single team created a lot of opportunities, but the ball on the hilltops was longer us.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply shot two beautiful goals," assessed the game Pellegrini, whose team scored in the competition after 636 minutes.
The finalist of last season Juventus at that was precisely the opposite before the collision - after the first three rounds of the Italian league has as a defender only point and score 2:4 is located at the 16th place of the table.
That's why the turnover on Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it'll kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year--Pirla, Tévez and Vidala.
In Manchester, Pogba, Mandjukchi, and Morata joined.
"That's right, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to it we'll find a victory wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best men in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially in the assault phase.
This is the result my players deserve.
"In front of our balancing goal, we could collect at 0:2, but Gianluigi held us," praised the coach Allegri golman Buffon.
"We burned a few good chances," worried Yayu Touré, City's reserve.
We must take experience from the League of Masters and try to get a better result next time.
Good-bye, Angelo, good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we continue on the question of immigrants, we should realize that all the media banging around is controlled by professionals.
According to the needs of the media, and also of the medium.
So let's just stop for a second.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of babies who carry their parents on dusty exodus paths.
And it creates a feeling of guilt and compassion in a person - that is, in a European person.
Well, they don't come here just desperate children, notice the pictures of boats landing on Greek islands that the baby can't see them so much!
Well, we've been missing images of ships heading for Lampedusa recently, fugitives outside the French border at Menton, whose beautiful promenades attract thousands of young men.
Of a lot of young black people.
And the images from Callais disappeared, where these men eat and the black men wait for them to pass through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think she's taking it anymore.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans somehow made no special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of it was fake.
So when it comes to quotas for fugitives, somehow it's denied that it's not just the unfortunate children from Syria, but also the stables - for the elders: fashion-fed, young men.
Their musculatures look like they're just coming out of some fitness center.
There's only one personal experience to this.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were on a private beach of the hotel.
Regardless of her privacy, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no ham.
And the young blacks came out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They went to the beach, all the clothes in branded clothes and shoes, in hand, as otherwise, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they were not interested and employees - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken all the beds.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was just in the sea had bad luck.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the heads of the nail cap, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they laid siege to the local beach bar and started breeding.
They planted tables around, piled up next to the sitting breakfast and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children ran from the dining room terrace to somewhere peaceful.
Incoming blacks drank beer straight from a third - how in the US series? - on the beach threw empty bottles around them.
They kept yelling at each other loudly.
But it wasn't English.
Then they got into a drink of wine, too, straight out of a bottle.
They jumped into the hotel swimming pool - in branded swimsuits, especially the young ladies - in the water, screaming and shouting, mothers with children and pensioners fled horribly, and in half an hour he was no longer on the beach or in the pool or any non-black guest.
Everybody's gone.
Whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were worried about them, and they were just talking about them.
The waiter said to me in the middle of the evening, "Have you seen the gold they were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it out of work," the waiter said.
I remembered, "I know, everybody had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had, like, a 20-centimeter massive cross of gold on his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are those drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've always seen them drink," answered the waiter.
Drugs don't smuggle, they don't even use them.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105, it wasn't that important to me yet.
I had no idea what would follow.
But secret services and top politicians should've known it first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, it has proved that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-corrected policies, like intellectuals and linked lobbyist and economical groups, have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognised major force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, also the tops of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of images of Moscow television from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunflowers at the station, but mainly - old and old - Muslim people welcomed their comrades.
For weeks, they have been battering on news on Czech television, according to some research by Germans almost everyone for the arrival of emigrants.
Of course, who was only a few days in Germany knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, famous public opinion research organised by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TV reported.
However, they have hidden what happened the next day in Germany: that in the poll vote to the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer wanted immigrants - the polls attended 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, declared: "Our efforts at the 'multi-culti' community totally failed."
Then she said, "Germany is giving up the fight for multicultural society."
"All efforts for such co-existence have totally failed."
In a country where there are four million Muslims, she said she failed to succeed in a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating themselves, and today they live with us, and for a while we were wondering that they would not leave one day.
That's not reality.
A multicultural approach, when we think we're just living happily together, has failed this approach.
He totally failed.
But neither does Merkel have the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Mr Schulz, President of the European Parliament, a Member for the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not have a degree in the Europarliament - yes, that is the one about which Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play a supervisor in the concentration for a minute - as he has done several times.
It seems, particularly under the impression of the last German politicians, that Germany has exceeded Rubicon.
Note that only for some, the majority of European politicians do not support these statements, statesmen of the countries that have been victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Which years have tried, at least on the outside, to deal with their horrendous past aggression and the killer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority, and violence is involved in Germany's soul?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped attempts by the Magna Carta to control the entire centre of Europe by all his power?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When he was suspended, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of the Great German, which led Germany and Europe to two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After the Marxists attempted to control the state, such as the Rote Armee Faction, and after the failure of the NDR, Germany, based on, for example, ecology, which was one of the main ideas of Nazism, began to develop a new German ideology.
We'd say sunflower.
The German elite have long defended the emergence of German nationalism, leaving behind all those fighters against the atom, the enthusiasts looking for paradise for everyone, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people in the world who want to do something different and better, they have fully bowed to the side of fighters against the warming of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they have forgotten that there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slovak current, which considers all the Slavs to be a difficult verb - from the time of Karl Marx, who, after the parents of the Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the final statements by Schulz and the German ministers openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of the leader Germany.
Which must be heard unanswered.
Otherwise, you're in trouble!
And when we mix the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind this is capital, especially German, which is appropriate, which is because Germany is in fact controlling most of the countries of Europe through banks and the Union.
At first, the sunflower’s keyhole led the Germans to swamps of ecologicalism and multiculturalism, and today it brought them home and may bring millions more Muslims.
Which, ragged sirens, will hit the wall of reality soon, which Merkel doesn't want to see, and they'll start to storm.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbours by force, once again a part of its inhabitants - but it seems to be a smaller part - ideologically deluding, but ultimately reality as always haunts it.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when a German public protest against the incoming Islamists strikes?
Will Muslims long live in Germany come to their aid, but certainly not assimilated to take on local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans, follow the fear of Islamizing their country?
What will this do with the Germans, and with Germany at all, when people rise up and protest publicly against the new Euro-human Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict that has prompted the support of solar ideologies in Europe, i.e. the idea of elite and in principle totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the relentless action taken against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of climbers: scare them to death.
Just knock and the robust knocks on you in a way that the weaker character doesn't have to stop right now.
A lively head will wipe you out, and it will cause you to get away from the road (or drive you away) of an unnecessary salesman and a living statue.
Maybe it's a shame you can't even get a clicker.
Even with us, it would be useful to banish a lot of bullying and scoundrels.
Pink bean (Oxalis Corniculateta).
A small weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so it is located among the outdoor tiles near my apartment.
On 16 September 2015 I photographed a beautiful plant, which is one of the expanding weeds, but it seems to create a nice impression on flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles are located.
She's untraceable. She's doing well in our garden.
She likes a more dry environment, she's easy to adapt, modest, and awkward.
He's creating chaotic composition sheets, but it's worth watching and taking pictures.
Underneath the crumb there is only the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompanying.
Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet in breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric society SPRS came in a shocking way to try to mediate women's knowledge of the importance of good diet in breast-feeding using pictures of children sucking from breasts painted by the appearance of unhealthy food.
Human milk is made up of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
It is recommended that pregnant women and newborn mothers increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories a day, thanks to their energy requirements.
However, new surveys suggest that increased intake of calories is not the only dietary measure for mothers to follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic production of their children and protected them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, though Nine's trying to take the lead in the Today Show
By the end of Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the cost of escaping the liberal leadership, it was not possible to create a sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
The early Nine show, projected from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise and host David Koch and Samantha Armytage have settled in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that the distances of Aussie TV viewers matter so much because it recorded on average 397 000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers of Today’s broadcast.
Today, it recorded a smaller increase in its evaluation compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was only past Thursday (343 000).
Today, in recent months, it fills the gap on Sunrise.
In August there was an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more than parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was a stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the New Zealand coast, has on average very impressive 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson himself could pull the TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night makes a clear yes.
The X Factor from Seven kept strong 1,136 million viewers, thereby beating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed observations on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30), which Andrew O'Keefe listed, on average, had 446 000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — a small victory over the Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline in The Chase Australia's second-night rating, Nina will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a Million Dollar Minute show that couldn't beat McGuire's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect boy - but who does he choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Flaws, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have been reluctant to find out who wins Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor with is covered by an unsurpassed secret.
And the three girls who stay here will definitely not tell who the right one is, who will eventually get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Flaws the day before only two left, they were ungrateful to us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut for Thursday's final.
All three women of lyricically commented on why Wood was a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as the reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, on the question, "If not, who gets Wood's final flower?" could their answers work as a link to who gets Bachelor's heart.
Like Jeavons-Flaws, so Markoschi quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood's other than them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy relationship since one day.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed Sarah and Sam's energy, I felt that they were compatible enough, and I still think that during the course," says Jeavons-Flaws.
"Sarah is a truly earthly woman, she's very funny," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're together well and pleasantly.
Sarah Mackay thinks that Sam Wood could make a great couple.
For her, she claims that during her last visit home, she realized that Wood could be "the real one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a game anymore - I opened my heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not for her, face mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can say it," she stuttered.
I like both girls anyway - it's between Snezena and Lana inseparably.
Bachalor airs Wednesday, 7:30 p.m. on T.

Jarryd Hayne had several opportunities to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after he moved to the United States and a lot of teams asked after his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul, and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which led to the conversion of the Australian rugby league at the first kick out of the hill at Tuesday's 20-3 win on Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the players and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush got hurt.
Tomsula was also still honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing the new ones before the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, stated that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only take care of another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught giving when he left the field after failing and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 the worst start of his career at NFL he could not even imagine.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's all," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the traps to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own goal territory led to the trio of Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans on which he holds the Australian flag on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Rus Vladimír Putin meet in a discussion on the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested with gunpoints on the Siberian rave.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The US came to the rescue of expatriates who sought to compensate for their assets.
The twins emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the couple turned to the state for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The Court first ordered them the amount requested, i.e. over 2.8 million crowns, but the appeal court changed their claim by granting them only less than 90 thousand crowns, referring to the fact that the amount of the compensation was determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The Emigrants were brought before the Supreme Court and were awarded the amount originally charged to them.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay off the money, turned the complaint to the U.S.
In the intervening period, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time - even if it was then an adequate compensation in relation to the property withdrawn - is now reaching only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of side-participants as if in a restaurant of entitled persons who have been in their homes since at least 1995 and who have not had the possibility of a home to grant a refund before," explained rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, why the U.S. side of the emigrants.
"The Court repeatedly called for the General Courts to proceed in restitution cases in such a way that any non-conformity would not be interpreted in the interest of the authorized persons and that the purpose of the restitution legislation, i.e. the removal of the property wrong caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state, should always be achieved," the judge added.
Evitu in the music studio DVA now the creative Radka Fischer.
By the way, Radka Fishar became the world's youngest Evita, when in 1998 she created the role of wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musician Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice in the Prague Theatre Spiral.
He says to go back to the same role: "To this day, Evita's demanding performance has not equaled much."
Evita is not just an amazing role; it is also a responsibility.
Monika Absolon recommended her as the first lady of Argentina.
I saw the Monk three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring to me.
I suddenly saw a whole new concept here.
I'm quite a fan of the more modern adjustments, but this one's just particularly done.
"The director of Ondřeje Sokola is original, relaxed and contemporary," says Fischer.
The imaginary handover of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolon's Birthday concert on September 27th from 19 hours in Studio DVA Theatre.
They're going to graduate tonight with the music of Evita.
The experiences will certainly include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Quiet your crying, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also jump off from the director’s board when he plays Karl Roden as President of Perón during the film’s film.
Due to public interest, further deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech studies by the world musician Evita show Studio DVA in collaboration with The Real Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In the direction of Ondřej Sokola, Monika Absolon originally studied the main female role.
Karel Roden appears on her side as President Perón and as the role of Che Peter Strenachik.
Legendary songs from the workshop Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with the Czech texts of Michael Prostějovský sound in the live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who participated in the first performance in the Spiral Theatre.
4 People Killed After Cops Fired Rubber Projections on Demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in Southern Nepal after police fired rubber projections in a crowd of demonstrators against the design of a new state constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi quarter, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district officer, reports that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and igniting bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they went to the rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, known for their ability to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, evidently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last in a week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesa ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and mitigated their political influence.
Another demonstration in West Nepal was also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which requires the emergence of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces — a major step in meeting the new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally controlled for centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been going on since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
The legislators voted this week in Kathmandu on the provisions of the draft constitution and officials state that the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We mustn't panic right now.
After losing on the ice of Litvinov, you did not even master the domestic duel with the hockey players Sparta (3:5).
Don't you have any fear of similarly catastrophic access to extraliga like a year ago?
I hope there's nothing like it.

NHC predicts 60 per cent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide, low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands is likely to be 60% in the formation of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center reported on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system, probably in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and Small Antilles, also has 60 percent probability of a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added a weather forecast based in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to pick 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it is launching a campaign aimed at choosing $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries in fleeing the war of overthrown and poor countries.
Google announced this on his blog by a very unusual route.
The report on her blog was published by Google staff member Rita Masoud on the basis of personal experience when, as a seven-year-old, she ran with her family from Kabul.
"We travelled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families, like her, are willing to help.
All contributions will be divided into 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that all the contributions made via Google.com/refugerelief to the amount of $5.5 million would double.
Europe is facing the biggest refugees of World War II, most of them coming from Syria, the four-year-old war that only this year drove 4 million people out.
Many people are fleeing the war of the condemned Afghan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful.
Benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese type 2 diabetics can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too soon to say whether mildly obese type 2 diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The evidence of mortality is long to be seen," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote the initiator for a new JAMA surgery study.
Abdominal surgery, bariatric surgery uses various methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was carried out on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the height-weight relationship, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher denotes overweight and people with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatment procedures in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, BMIs who had not received surgery for diabetes remained approximately the same as 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and in part in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 percent and only about 2 percent of patients were completely resolved for the comparison of diabetes.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were shown "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored the patient’s level of A1c in the blood, reflecting the continuous blood sugar level in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7%, according to researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin value of A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the treatment group, however, the value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - reflected in better levels of A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results to two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the group lost more weight with bypass compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), increased BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and the probability of remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden, where they have found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who underwent a bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among surgery patients, according to Blackstonea it is a soothing result for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"The fact here is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, it states.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after the patient's BMI dropped between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to let people know the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once these genetic changes are accumulated, which firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to grasp all refugees, Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan leader of the Buddhists called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the refugee crisis in his speech during the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which deals with the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He claimed that under the present circumstances, mankind's interest should be put ahead of the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to solve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution, how to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
Using force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the charges against George Bush after a 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the violent reaction of the US has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to address this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," he said to the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have used an ambulance in the last 4 years
The toxicological centres around the United States reported a nearly 400 per cent increase from 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed a high-alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the toxicological centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia's toxicological centre, the number of sanitation use in children under the age of 12 reported at the venom control centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children get more access to these products, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who must be taken to the emergency," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink sanitation intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos of Youtube show teens drinking sanitation because of cheap habits.
The Nazis allegedly mixed an ambulance with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Young children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the medium.
"Children don't think about hurting them," Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitary) are those that are perfumed.
To the dispossession are sanitation with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very tempting for children.
The sedative contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several spots can mean alcohol poisoning.
"It is a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City Medical Director of the Control Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't just let the whiskey glass slide either, but people leave these ambulances outside, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently died in school of up to four arcs of an ambulance with the scent of strawberries and was transported for treatment for emergency.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be alcohol in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered incomprehensible words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors were monitoring her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell and hit her head with alcohol, says Ritchey.
"It was very terrifying," said CNN Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or ensure that child-friendly sanitation is available.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some ambulances were linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after swallowing an ambulance containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health professionals believed that the product contained methyl, a fatal agent rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in North New York planned to poison their "evil" teachers by deploying antibacterial products across the room," according to police reports.
The teacher is very allergic to ambulances and has prohibited their presence in the room.
The police judged the polluted plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Fama: No conflict in the Celtic team
Griffiths marries the rumors of a non-conformity in Celtic, while Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he'll reverse it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is concerned that the new force from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
Penalta from the first half of ADAM Rooney provided Aberdeen with a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, which gave Dons a five-point lead between themselves and the Celtic.
Griffiths denies talking about non-conformity
This situation has sparked rumors about the non-conformity in Celtic, which were denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased surveillance in preparation for the fight against the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're under pressure, but I think the players are looking forward to it.
Inadequacy in Scottish title rivalry boring Netherlands - de Boer
Former reserve agent Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry among them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador Ajax, states: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of the Celtic games, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers anymore.
People here aren't just talking about coming back to the Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
At the matches of the Old Company there is great tension and not only the Scottish people watch these games.
I'll turn things back to good, commit to Deil.
ROONYDealia admitted that Celtic was a bit confused, but the Norwegian boss committed himself to turn things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the subsequent fall from the League of Masters was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic's already had a bad time and he's getting up again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about what they're doing.
We're on the same page, but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic support because it makes players so much better.
Now it's very important to stay with each other.
Warburton's worried about the power of January.
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his January targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the great purchase of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the team's Ibrox unity.
Former Chief Brentford says, "The cold window is very different from the summer window."
Players who come in the summer have a whole pre-season housing period, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
The transitional objective of Celtika Michu indicates retirement
Attacker Swansea Michhu, who was associated with Celtic in the window, suggested that he could retire after his contract with Swansea was terminated.
The 20-year-old shooter has been having trouble with a tilting ankle for two years and has failed to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by the referee Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands by his claim and says, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tyncastle
Hardheaded Hibbe was severely punished after confessing that he sang a song with a lyrics directed at former players Hearts Rudolf Skacel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn pub in Edinburgh in front of the Edinburgh derby in Tyncastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a moment of gain," the attacker stated and continues, "I can safely say that I will not return to Tyncastle unless it's in the Celtic jersey."
The Tannadice Council believes in the administration of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United continues to believe in correcting the situation by the current team management - but admits that the collapse on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boy ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCinnes likes to win a "disgusting victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately stick against Hamilton Accies in order to win the seventh league victory after themselves and a five-point lead in front of the Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the penalta from the first half in Adam Rooney's hand.
McInnes says, "There's no team that wins anything, no cups or leagues without winning this type of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged, while overall UK unemployment rises
Incommunicado in Scotland remains unchanged to 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The rate of Scottish unemployment was 5.9 per cent above the rate in UK (5.5 per cent), as data from the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland declined by 12,000 over a period of three months, the number of workers now stopped to 2,612,000.
Employment in Scotland fell to 72.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the British average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell said in a comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly the year that Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we witnessed further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment grew while unemployment declined.
Why I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will follow the execution of a man.
If this happens, and I hope it won't happen, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison, and I'll see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who would witness his death.
I received the invitation first in January with my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm starting to worry about it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because there are often more requests than places available, there is a morbid lottery that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to 5.
Whoever is elected will be watching the whole execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends and create a special bond with him through the months of calls and one two and a half hour's visit.
I like that kid.
We laugh often when we talk.
Prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell the breeder the story as it pleases him, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could have made it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could get me off the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help prevent the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't be sure to say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of a criminal offense.
But I believe he's very likely to be innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is a bad one.
And it's from this perspective that I'm going to follow his death.
I can't say I'll be really objective.
To this end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die an unnecessary death.
The man escaped from Canning River after a police chase.
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after exonerating the Canning River man.
The man's bet from Petrhu that he was running away from the police didn't come out after he got into shallow mud water just meters away from a cop who tried to forcefully talk him into returning to shore.
The Canning Vale police were summoned to an incident that exceeded Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by sneaking across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and the police negotiations."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they run away," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins Football Champion gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car to the ditch to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning a bitatlon Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threaten to end the race.
Peeter Moody accused the racer Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizers and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and came from the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai while maintaining on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation with regard to Lidarin's positive cobalt wipe that he couldn't explain.
He bit into his tongue about being accused of spying for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on this for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm going to have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to have a good night's sleep.
I want to keep my head up and make the owners think I'm making the most of it for them.
If they think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Before, Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Before 18 months, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will appoint after the question - and offered him employment in my stables for finding out about the things that are being done in my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in an effort to catch me, they've completely burned me down.
Robert Roulston, former President of the RVL, David Moody, current President of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's becoming a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and ensure that people outside the training position take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they do.
Maybe I need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying will give them the material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will push them, and I will carry the burden upon them, that they may make a decision.
I have the support of my family, and I can go away.
The coach's frustration levels increased with a long-term cobalt investigation including Lidari and recent scratching in it made it feel like "he could get hours of his license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the undefeated Black Caviar Champion, marked the treatment rule on the day of the race for "fun" after the horse on its feet was applied clay lining or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against racing rules.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have been last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on race day.
Moody faced three months of disqualification for treatment of the plot on the day of the plant, to which the organizers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
A Cobram driver caught was arrested.
The police arrested the man who hit the cyclist on the weekend in Cobra and left after the collision.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Main Road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50 - year - old man from Nathalia himself confessed to the Shepparton police.
He is expected to be accused of not stopping in an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in a stable hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy strikes rivals for wrestling claims.
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the moves of his players as a "plan-setting" by two NRL favourites of the Prime Ministership.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said that the referees allowed the players Storm to "resurrection" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the Sydney final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark on Strom after his team won the finals of qualification over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "review" rugby league and according to him two from Queensland were not "too great" on wrestling.
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation raised his confidence because his team is criticized by two coach leaders, which may mean they are afraid of defeating the Storm team.
"It's always coming-- I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten by 24-2," he said on Wednesday, Bellamy.
I can guarantee that in the last year we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and techniques, in the past weeks we've only been focusing on contact during the procedures, and that meant a turnover for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a little bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like this always come in this year's section.
Bellamy misjudged Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that the Bennet team of St George-Illawarra Dragons won in 2010 the premiere game of "a boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right about his Saturday game being as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said that he didn't care.
But now he's got a team that can play a game style that seems overwhelming to him, especially his young publishers with their speed.
Such a football you'd like to play if you had this type of player available.
This opinion was said in 2010 and now wants all the teams to play his football style - but not every team has two subscribers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so such a style can't play.
It makes me feel more confident because they say things like that because they're afraid of fighting against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got into big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that in the game Storm and Roosters fell more goals than in the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The game of Team Broncos was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two other attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are the breaks and non-scraping attempts interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, that means we'll meet again at the same time.
Storm has a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Crownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man received bail of USD 200,000 for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life sentence for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled from Queensland received bail of USD 200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years) was one of the five men who had been arrested last month by the federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solaya yacht, who came from South America through Vanuatu and got stuck in Comore in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with the co-accused at the port during the morning and later met with them at the Coomer Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for commercial cocaine, Mr. Maksimovice's lawyer made a defense that there was no evidence that he owned an entire amount and that he could be at the coffee shop at random and innocent.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan believed Maksimovic would have fled.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the courthouse.
On the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovice jointly offered bail for $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the vows of both persons, it is clear that the deposit of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Apparently, their efforts alone were insufficient, for the accused failed to appear before the court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on condition that he surrenders both to the Austrian and Serbian passports, will report daily to the police and will observe the curfew from 18 o'clock in the morning to 6 am.
Stephen Hogg used a girl's phone to lure her pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to get photos of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, then applied to her online chat, where he had a lot of naughty photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing a phone and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogga.
She went through it, and before she warned her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police joined in and saw five photos, then the analytical computers found the address and discovered a "disquiet" search on the web using expressions to search for immoral pictures of children.
Hogg then told the police that his reason was to "make pedophiles" on the Internet before he "played as a police officer and scared them."
A fiscal representative named Eilid Robertson said for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he depended on scaring people.
He admitted he was doing a computer search, but he claims he was just pretending to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted him to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them.
He says it's gone drunk and he says he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on her phone, she called her mother, she shook and cried.
She saw immoral images on her phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking or delivering inappropriate pictures of children on 14 June last year, violated bail conditions on 25 January and failed to appear before the court on 24 March this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim has requested that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual delinquents because he can argue that in his act there was no "no fundamental sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has adjourned his sentence on October for reporting social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other outstanding cases.
He was placed on a list of sexual delinquents before the date of his verdict.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe presented the Parliament with a bad speech
Mr Mugabe, the African oldest leader, had fallen on the stairs leading to the stage earlier this year.
He wasn't injured, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
Parliament's opening was also distorted by opposition legislators' allegations that they received anonymous threats of killing, which warned them against the arrest of Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month he was interrogated and provoked during his speech about the state of the nation in Parliament - which is a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The president of the Parliamentary Club of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians adopted text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to defend Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that won't appear, but is named 'death'," he told the Journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and as soon as it emerges from Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The Chief stated that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "need" about threats against Members.
Hewlett-Packard is about to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancels 25 000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-saving effort for the business services of the company.
HP will later this year be divided into two companies listed on the stock exchange and separate the store with computers and printers from its growing company hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and will start in the fourth quarter, according to the HP statement.
"This restructuring activity will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and chairman of the board of directors, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of trades that will help businesses move to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual income statement of more than $50 billion and will "focus on providing non-competitive integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will be the decomposition of the company founded in 1930 by the Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who produced electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called "Silicon Valley's birthplace".
HP was undergoing a massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of America's largest technical firms, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a highly specialized company has better results.
Arsanal Captain Michael Artet says fellow players must get to Jack Wilsher's wounded before Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger also pointed out to Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play Christmas again.
This best scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from the perspective of history, its involvement in the next summer European championship is obviously uncertain.
The big damage to this most recent problem is that Wilshire ended last season strong after injury to the ankle and then got back to his former form during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger says.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injury he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of other injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also a unpleasant pattern.
Research carried out by the Prime Minister Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilcher since he had his game debut six years ago.
In the last five years, he only played 65 league games in Arsenal of the total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in the six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs who lost the most days due to injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of an enchanted circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back after the injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a contest," Wenger claims.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the League of Champions of the Middle Night against Dinamo Zagreb match with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably coming in.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroude instead of Nacho Montreal Theo Waltcott.
"I'm trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe out," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite of the F-group procedure, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most terrifying stadium in Europe.
The Dinamos were also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after they kept the campaign "invincible" last season.
The stadium shook on Wednesday night with an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter.
That was already done in Zagreb this year.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal learned from the last season of the League of Champions, when he surrendered against Monaco and his distant hope remains that he will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is huge," Wenger says.
It never happened to Arsanal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
Absence of similar images in different shows is a frightful one, especially given the need to open up men more desperate than ever before, with regard to suicide among young men under 15 years of age.
In 2013, it was the only biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserrably (CALM) 2015 as the Year Men whose aim is to question a culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
In the heart of this fight lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students presenting symptoms of depression found that if the injured person had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their recovery chance doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents half a chance to experience mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, of course, it must be attainable first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not on content of messages, the immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though in reality we are more isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker recently explained, money doesn't buy any better luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which culminated through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victim, the moment of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all the springs of knowing that, yes, men can also relate to it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: ..."my role as listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has truly confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with their friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
He stresses little moments in male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, outsider's situation on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support must come from closer, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrenndsFest this weekend by Comedy Central, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perku where the celebration interior will be completely redesigned.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central Station from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG mix Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matudid and Edinson Cavanim after shooting a goal against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored during his debut in the League of Masters and helped PSG beat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the game report and the game response.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in the Tuesday game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey to the League of Masters with a final comfortable 2-0 against Malma on Parc des Princess.
Di Maria shot the goal less than four minutes after his debut in the League of Masters and this PSG player sent French champions to win, but then threw several chances, until they finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the goal with his head in 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they focus not only on the qualification of the discharge wheels, but on improving their way to the quarterfinals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they got three points, it wasn't the classic performance of the team Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a prodigal goal, and later he was replaced against his home team and club, where he began his famous career in 1999.
"In the League of Masters it is not easy to win out or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things that we will have to improve with the season process," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, which at home spent this weekend’s 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Liza 1, but was shaded in Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who would move the PSG in Europe to a new level after the transition from Manchester United last month, and showed why when he ran to the pass of Marc Verratti behind the defence of Malma and sent the ball behind Johan Wiland to the remote corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to start a grand PSSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoff and got into this phase, joined 9 international sites in the basic composition and five defensemen and two stalled hostages were a heavy opponent.
But aside from Nikola Djurdjica's shot, which just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer him much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves sought the benefit of the attack by miscarriages and a lousy ending, which was neither good nor from Ibrahimovica, who could not fire five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, it turned out to be much more appropriate when it came to preparing the chances for its fellow players, and it was just from his wallet, when Di Maria sent the shot that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayan head sent after the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic lost to him on the left arm from Maxwell.
This ended all of Malma’s thoughts about the possibility that they could extract something from the game, and only Wiland’s excellent surgery from the great nearness destroyed David Luisa’s hopes and score remained unchanged even when the goal of Ezequiel Lavezzi’s alternator was unrecognizable at the end of the match.
The coach of the Malmo Age Hareide team admitted on occasion that the PSG were higher than his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the League of Masters was held in December of last year."
Since then, we've only played a Swedish league that's not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hat down for Paris.
It was an amazing fight for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for stock sales
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which was affected by the collapse of commodity prices, earned on Wednesday $2.5 billion from the sale of shares under his extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it has sold new shares worth around £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with the confusion of commodity prices, as China's slowdown in the economy reduces demand and sparks the destruction across markets.
Rights issues were sent to the centre of the Glencore stock price at the top of the London stock market in early early morning trades.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent above.
Glencore discovered last week that the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion is part of a broader plan to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which was accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares at 123pts per share, which represented a 2.4 % discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
So they got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about the extension of Chinese growth inhibition have reduced the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities have collapsed by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, confirming the White House on Tuesday's report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on 25 September in the response of Barack Obama to a visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, said a report.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, to dinner, which will take place after the talks have ended.
"The visit of President Xi represents an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and calls for cooperation in addressing problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the two states' differences," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the UN meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to deal with controversial problems, including the concerns of Washington from the alleged cyberspionery of China and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency lights fired by Germany did not put the European crew on hold, but the ship is already forcing a change of course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
On Monday, the European Union decided to deal first with the refugee problem: it will systematically manage migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they enter the old continent - in particular in Greece, rather than argue over the future allocation of refugees according to quotas based on the quantities that are increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States changed their priorities.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, it is necessary first to filter those who are arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary to manage migration," the text of the minister discussed in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases pressure.
It restores border checks, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
Central power makes it clear that without it, no free movement in Europe is possible.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, although with varying intensity.
Hungary has come a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
That it's a dominant effect, but it's also blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of compulsory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also Hungary for those who have already passed into the interior.
The French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it's getting cold.
According to unofficial statistics in Italy, two thirds of new arrivals have already been registered and identified with fingerprints removed.
The Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others not to leave camps on its crates where refugees would accumulate on its account.
The real black hole remains Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200,000 people landed this year, twice as many as have arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they went through crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge, green hole.
Athens, which is still in financial dissipation and which is awaiting a new government, has put their hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of shared concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's commission promises that the establishment of checkpoints will take place as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," the EU interior minister agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
This is therefore the case with the European Border Control Agency’s intervention teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum-seekers and strengthen its surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching.
The new emergency situation of the eight-years has pushed the question of mandatory quotas and 160,000 refugees, which the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament have set up at the beginning of the year and was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was preserved in the text approved by the majority of the eight-year period on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been agreed in June during the EU's hectic summit, is concluded by Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, three of them reportedly.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, Germany’s nationality is also a woman who survived as one of the affected eight - member groups.
Previous media reports indicate it's about Polka.
About a 30 - year - old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with severe leg injuries in the femur area.
The dead were formed by the AFP mostly by the 40s.
"The rescue action is over, and the victims' bodies have also been transferred to I.D. to Briancon," explained the Prefect of Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard.
The disaster took place around noon in the Pelvaux mountain area under the top of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins mountain, measuring 4015 metres.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 metres wide and is about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
As a result, a huge amount of snow poured into the eight - group group at a height of about 1,900 feet [3,900 m].
Today, meteorological services did not warn the area against adverse weather.
Trepsovsky before the fight with Brago: Finally, the right Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpisovský, during his premiere in the cups, managed to go through the European League in front of the European League and now enjoy enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slavon at the opening of the main stage of the competition welcomes the finalist from 2011 Bragu and according to the coach wants to force her game style.
After all the nerves in the extermination fights, when every goal and every situation could set you off on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're gonna play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every shot we get, we can play our tactics, and we're not tied to just a double fight.
"I look forward to it, and it is a real Europe, before it was only a qualification," said Trpisovsky at a press conference.
Brag thinks he's a top team.
It will be very active, they have the most Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may just be harder not to have that name, but he has a player in his frame who was giving three goals to Manchester.
"It's an excellent team at top level," said Trpisovsky.
But Brag doesn't think he's a bright guy.
I take it we're playing at home, so the outsiders aren't.
"I think we have shown in both domestic competition and preschools that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm," said the coach, whose team lost from eleven duels of this season only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec can even force Braze's style.
We have a team waiting for us, who will be strong on the ball, and at the same time, he is untypically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 deployment with a quick transition to an attack phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the field," said Trpsovsky.
We studied a lot of competition in the preschools, which has helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted to practice.
"And we definitely want, even if it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," he added the coach.
Student films will control the Sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries reported their works to the 15th edition of the International Festival of Student Films in Písek this year.
Four dozen of them, which the committee composed of students and educators sent to the finals, will be projected from 15 to 18 October in Portyč cinema.
The best selects an international jury, said the speaker at the Jakub Charwatt Festival.
Every year the festival has its special theme, which is derived from the festival music.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year's festive evenings, Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine the elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And, of course, we also need to solve the crime that was committed in this year's subpoena," Charvat said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student productions - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, to which, for example, the winner of last year's year, director Nicholas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo, and the British producer Hemant Sharda.
Festival organizers, like every year, prepare a accompanying program.
Here comes Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, Turbosanson Group Fly?, plays band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will host two exhibitions of photos.
The first will bring a graduate of the Sand Film School and a holder of prestigious awards, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ashengrenner.
The second exhibition will bring closer to the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
In a word with visitors comes cameraman and documentaryist Martin Čech, the German film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber with his music and the Sand Parents Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotny will baptize his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, a FAMO patron in Sand who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to gather here, exchange experiences and develop joint relationships and film craft," the speaker said.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, attend several work competitions at once and gain a job position.
The festival is connected with the creation of a Private higher professional film school in Písek.
Her founders, the wife of Vladana and Miloni Terč, organized the first year of 1997.
It took place once every two years in the sixth year.
In the event of the collapse of the CK, the insurance companies have to pay the customers' claims in full.
Insurance companies should pay customers' claims in the event of the collapse of the travel agency in full.
She decided on this in the middle of the Chamber when she approved the amended amendment of the Tourism Business Conditions Act.
Travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee in accordance with a proposal aimed at assessing the Senate.
Insurance companies do not agree to the obligation to pay the client's claims over the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development is insisting on adapting, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end insurance for travel agencies against bankruptcy when the amendment is paid.
The proposal, however, is also criticized by travel agents.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development, Karla Šlechtová (for ANO), pointed out that cases where insurance companies have not paid full compensation are not Euro-comform.
She drew attention to this year's Constitutional Court Decision, which confirmed that the client was entitled to a full refund of money regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, Šlechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but must have such a limit to be feasible," Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek said.
He doesn't think the bank guarantee is gonna work because no one's going to keep it unlimited.
"Travel offices will have to end their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
Member of the Presidium Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalouske worries on the basis of a survey between the Member States of the CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance," he said.
The insurance statement does not consider Okamura relevant, nor does there exist any official written expression in that sense.
They say they're finding out if the travel agents are going to be involved, which Okamura says is no problem.
Jan Fischerová (ODS) also warned about the provision, which referred to the competitive opinion of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague, Petr Bendl, who spoke about lubricating the stairs to Czech travel agencies.
Fisher's travel agencies won't be able to negotiate insurance.
"The consumer's protection works," Fischer says.
Her proposal to release the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Neither did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) propose to return the proposal to the committee for alleged violation of the civil code.
Philip drew attention to travel agencies that he believed could put consumers at risk.
In view of the Constitutional Court’s verdict, the rapporteur withdrew her proposal which would limit the liability of the insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance performance would not cover the whole risk.
The novel will not initially propose a minimum four million insurance limit for travel agents offering air travel and a million limit for offices selling bus tours, for example.
The border will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales from the sale of tours.
However, the enforcement limit will have to be such that, in the event of the collapse of the travel agency, it covers all customers’ claims.
Even after the amendments, the standards provide that travel agencies will have to indicate, in the case of the tours sold, which travel agency organises the tour.
Travel agencies will have to submit to the insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract, among other things, information on the management and number of tours.
The approved amendment to the Committee for Public Administration also includes the provision of additional regular information to the insurance undertakings.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with data on the number of passengers and tours sold every month, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of advance and sales for tours and for vouchers.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil any of the legal obligations relating to the insurance undertaking, it shall invite it, in accordance with the proposal for a remedy, or it will be able to prohibit it from concluding new contracts in the event that a breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of the customers.
Novela is also scheduled to adjust the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its request, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The application will contain a report on the use of state money last year, a financial spending plan and an overview of the next two years.
However, according to the association, the legislator of the law did not have an idea of the situation that would arise if the insurance company entered into a contract with the CK.
She won't be allowed to arrange tours, and clients who bought a trip before default of insurance will lose it by association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even fail, although its management was in good condition.
One way that travel agents can cope with this situation will be to seek compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and take advantage of much softer conditions abroad, and then we will only act on our market as agencies, said the Vice-President of the Jan Papaž Association.
The draft amendment, according to him, also includes the bank guarantee institution, but it is not thought enough that it cannot be implemented at all in practice, as the bank guarantee cannot sound at an unlimited amount.
In addition, the association says that the change in practice of the past is de facto unnecessary.
In the two-year horizon, it will be necessary, given the new EU directive, to recast the whole law.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies are now operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have completed their activities.
The local travel agencies will sell tours worth approximately 20 billion CZK per year.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must aim to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of regulars in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after dealing with German prime ministers of the earth.
At the same time, she again appealed for the allocation of refugees who had already arrived in the EU to eight-year-olds among the Member States.
We need to help countries where refugees leave, or where they stay after leaving the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are taking stock of the dignity of the refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which such a signal could also be greater financial assistance or closer cooperation of the EU with international humanitarian organisations.
"The common countries also support the German government to promote a fair distribution of the scale of the refugee crisis to the European countries," said Merkel.
Earth Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woodke said in this context at a press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU countries.
The allocation of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among other things.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke for speeding up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know if they have a chance to stay here as soon as possible.
It is also necessary for the authorities to move faster with the integration of foreigners, said the Brasibor Prime Minister.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends in the care of the runner should serve to integrate those who have the chance to obtain asylum.
It'll take more teachers to make the refugees handle German.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runners succeed in integrating, they can make a difference for us, he said.
Matt Damon's bagging the dissertation in the film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmer Effie Brown during the discussion of diversity with the claim that this was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday HBO episode the Greenlight project interrupted an actor occupied in the Brown series, stressing the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversion, you do it by filming and not by show," Damon claims.
Shocked, Brown reacted badly with distrust and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments on Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown have joined together with a well-known producer, Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers, to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever's the director, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character that's a hooker that's packed by a white pimp.
A producer of the Dear White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon cut off that their direction "would eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon's comment.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing the video, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain that the diversion is SO BILL that it hurts."
Tweet has gained more than 5000 retweets and 4,000 characters since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social debate.
After being killed by teenage Michael Brown by a Belarusian police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took national action and pushed lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against coloring people.
In February, singer Prince made suggestions on the movement while mentioning nominated in the category Album of the year during the award of Grammy prices.
"The Albas are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The latest lead movement Black Lives Matter presented a statement in response to Fox News' question, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," said the leader.
Damon was recently listed on the list of entertainers, producers and media mosuls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss the view of the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation, or already met with the pope, it is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
The professional climber and picnic Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and took home a million dollars.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the contestants managed to overcome all obstacles on the track.
During this season's finals, two men fought in the last round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb of more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated as the first one at the specified limit and became the first contestant in American Ninja Warrior to overcome the 4th section, but Caldiero beat him for a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for intelligenceE! News immediately after his hard-earned victory and was aware that he was still in shock of winning the main prize of $1 million.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E said in response to my win.
"So suddenly... I can't imagine what it's going to be like right now."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on the course of the finals and why Britten won't get any reward, despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the line.
According to the rules, money belongs to the person who completes the line as quickly as possible.
"If there are more competitors involved in the track, the prize will win with the best of time," Weed said.
Although the profits of the main win would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think there's any resentment in him.
He is pleased that he has succeeded in accomplishing what he has accomplished.
His fans gave him a warm welcome.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
He's a hero for his children and his wife."
Geoff told me, "If anyone could defeat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I were to win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which starts shooting in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just passed by Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For Detroit tigers, the second half of the season was not just a walk in a pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are currently located in the last place of the central division of the American League.
The Tigers just stopped their defeat when they beat Misosota in Tuesday's game with a close result of 5-4 at Target Field Stadium.
The twins wasted a chance to approach the Houston Astros team and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
"Playing is always fun and doesn't matter how," said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Alfredo Simon's tiger pitcher kept his offensive appearance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another in the sixth and ninth shift.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 of the launch and 3 rounds.
It was only his third winning game of the last nine matches.
"This year I want to end with convincing results," Simon said.
"It's hard to get into a fight when you often sit on a bench and that's why I want to get in the game."
Tiger batter Victor Martinez scored three times and made two rounds and his first download point since mid-August.
For Martinez it was the first three-point game since the last June game in which he hit four times in a match against Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned beautifully into it," said Ausmus.
"He looked good in training, he flew well, and managed to move it to the game."
Thanks to the three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins have the best chance of getting back in the game.
Central Pole Byron Buxton won the shift thanks to two points on the left side of the playground.
The true Aaron Hicks field won a point thanks to a set bat and Simon had Brian Dozier removed before he was replaced by a Blaine Hardy leftover.
Hardy removed his only opponent Mauer and had a batterer named Miguel Sana, who fired the ball and stabbed two feet and left Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the targets and chances of a draw in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third metameter over two meters.
Pluffe has already won 27 rounds over two feet in this season and is circling the league tables.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer won two download points, and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed person has ruled out San for three adventures.
Detroit took advantage and gained points in Phil Hughes' game.
Tigers gained three rounds in the first two shifts against a serviced rightist who took on more than a month’s break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift, I felt I was doing better."
After resisting the pressure in the first shift, Hughes let one point in the second metameter Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the real J.D. Martinez field took out Victor Martinez, who was the first to round all the finishes.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
The third metatar Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the playground and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was overturned when he tried to move on the third foot.
Tigers were added in second shift when James McCann's pitcher and Anthony Goss field got two and then there was one point, and the score was 3-0 on the scoreboard.
"It got us down to our knees," said manager Double Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it to the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, ended up in the third shift with no points and replaced him with A.J. Achter.
Hughes took off three feet, got six shots and four strikes.
NOTE: Annibal Sanchez, the real tiger pitcher, ended the match with pain in the right arm.
He'll be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injuries due to tight muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, should be in the middle game.
Sanchez will be replaced by the left-hand Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and proceed against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was replaced by David Price's left pitcher, he has scored 1-1 after 4 matches.
From August 20th, however, he hasn't played for a heavy muscle yet.
Tigers and Twins will play the third mutual game at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is built by the Minnesota-left Ervin Santana pitcher (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi Calls for the opening of the economy into a wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to a wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," said the 16th meeting of the central management group for deepening the overall reform.
Promotion of opening in the birth reforms will provide a new impetus and vitality, and will also provide a new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The Management Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory approaches to the market, the release of border control policy, state aid (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programmes.
This step is important because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the declaration states.
The government will also relax the powers delegated to the companies and will make sure that the companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also states that China will allow the border area to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for supporting regional growth.
In an effort to open up the State-controlled sector, more areas will be opened by private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement states.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card", thanks to optimisation of requirements and simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop a professional judge and a prosecutor was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
The Karlovy Vary region may have a new bed unit.
According to Deputy Headman of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Panika (ČSSD) is the current capacity of the bed wards of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region, sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
However, there are possibilities of extending care in the region.
For example, the Department of Surgery could establish a one-day surgery centre, where according to the concept set up, surgical professions, which do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours, would be performed.
In which specific hospitals a one-day surgery facility should be located, it is not clear yet.
In Karlovy Vary’s skin ward, a laser centre with the possibility of using laser technology for skin disease could be created.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an apal center that would care for patients with brain impairment who are in vegetative condition.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such equipment in the Ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, are the beds of subsequent care, especially the beds of the long-term ill (LDN), whose capacity in the Most High is inadequate, and in particular should closely link to beds of acute care.
Part of this device should function as a bed rehabilitation and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends the concept.
As noted, the cot of subsequent care is missing mainly at Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There they could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, there is a social health bed focused on Alzheimer’s disease.
These beds are insufficient throughout the Republic and could therefore serve other regions as the so-called Alzheimer's Center.
Hospitals should also be prepared, as recommended, for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds for which European grants will be released.
"It is a bed that will connect to the wells of specialised care and create space for translation of patients after surgery, for example, following cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplant or other procedures," describes the landscape concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.
