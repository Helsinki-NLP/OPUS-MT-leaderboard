Inflation in Europe has leaped over food
The fast-tracking inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
The November price rise in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, with a registered annual inflation of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October, announced by the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast was only 3 per cent, according to Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central bank (ECB), the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the basic interest rate by reducing together with rising prices of raw materials and falling unemployment leading to inflationary spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two percent, but it is close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to "daunt" inflation so that it will not have to do anything later on.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 percent of the 15 - year record; in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has risen due to rising food and energy prices.
The term wheat prices have risen by 88 per cent, and soybean rates have reached the highest levels since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay substantially more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil in world markets rose by 52 percent in this year, and last month it was already one barrel of black gold of almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will drop from 2.1 per cent in 2008 to 2.5 in 2009, however, it will already fall to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain approximately 3 per cent over the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to double the interest rates during 2008.
Gallop sees a government crisis
The number of supporters of the Fides movement has increased significantly since the beginning of December after a long-term stagnation, so now it has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of socialists the Gallupa Institute has never measured a 13% support so low.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71 per cent) of the support to the MSP.
The MDF and SZDSZ are according to the survey under the threshold for entry into Parliament: their support across the population is two percent.
Among certain voters of the party, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has worsened even in view of the previous minima - the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while the other 46 per cent say that the situation is quite bad.
Families evaluate their material situation after spring and summer prospects again more pessimistically.
As for next year, the majority of the population with further deterioration and only a tenth of the population with improvement are counted.
In December, 71 percent of the respondents were judged, which is the most recent polls by the Gallupa Institute that the Prime Minister is doing his job rather badly than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsany believes or believes very much 13 percent of the respondents, while Viktor Orban has 38 percent of the supporters.
The prime minister does not believe 54 percent, the President of the Fides movement 27 percent.
One of the indicators for the development of the political situation is how much the public believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without changing the government.
While last October’s unrest has led to the government’s separation and the prime minister’s 35 percent demand, this share is currently only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing solutions only in the next election.
For the interest of the referendum, it is appropriate that 60 percent of the respondents replied to a question concerning their possible participation, that the referendum would certainly come and another 20 percent said that it would likely come.
To compare, the "parliamentary elections organised this Sunday" would certainly only take part in 55 per cent and another 15 per cent consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable on the basis of current intentions.
Not 74, 79 and 84 percent hospital hospital fees would tell the school doctor.
If we look at the same proportions only in the circle of people who are promising to participate, then the introduction of school fees, medical fees and hospital fees would be 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most expensive is Auchan, nearly five times the Tesco.
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle preserved last year, on average 16% price level growth, with the difference that VAT did not increase this year.
Newspaper article Napi Gazadaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of Napi Gazedaság in the Budaörsian trade triangle this year grew by an average of 16 percent, but in all hypermarkets, more than a thousand forints rose at the price.
Since the prices in the supermarkets of food "flighted" already last December, the percentage of the previous high base did not show such a drastic rip-off.
For consumers, however, it is unfortunate that what last year could possibly buy at a cost of under nine thousand forints will not be ordered now for ten thousand.
The daily economy consumption basket in surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of tens of thousands forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price for the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 there was 6 800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the cruel breasts, nuts and poppy were greatly undermined.
The prices of bread and flour were consistent with the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
Competition did not go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of two-litre Coca Coly in the neck bottle was below 200 forints, so even the advance cost of the product was only 257 forints.
Even so, this year he appeared according to the consumption basket of Napa Gazdaság Auchan as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices of the Napi Gazadaság consumer basket were raised by 15, while Tesco and Auchan were around 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest and lowest value of the consumer basket, the difference was 12 per cent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 per cent.
In forintech was an increase of an average of 1,480.
The average price increase of last year was 1 206 forints, with prices affected by the growth of VAT on Christmas last year.
It is this process of trade that has been disrupted, business houses clearly have not been able to decide how large price ranges they are to determine for each product, as they have not been able to predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader plans the rate of circulation of the product is wrong, due to the price margin adapted to the volume of the circulation, it may lose significant profit.)
Due to VAT, last year's rise in the price of the consumer basket of Napi Gadzdaság was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest showed a price difference of 844 forints.
This year the extreme difference did not occur, the most expensive basket now stood by 1,630 forints more than last year, and also the cheapest insulted by 1,284 forints.
In comparison with both Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase occurred, and in less than 20 months, daily consumption in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent.
(This, inter alia, does not fully confirm the Central Statistical Office’s data: it measured a price increase of more than 30 per cent in a few basic foods over 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, this seems almost impossible according to the consumption basket of the daily economy, since the price level of the product, quite expensive in the last year, has proved to be above 10 per cent, even in the worst case.
The flour suppliers are assuming increasingly stronger positions than egg suppliers, and they have managed to make drastic increases in prices in international chains.
Hypermarkets in a commercial gold triangle do not complain, still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers no longer care about the prices in the three shops visited.
They buy all the coins, they buy the durable food on the payroll.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets consisted of long fronts at the cashiers, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, in the countryside the turnover is lower, several international chains complain to research firms that the markets are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places it is stored in disinfectants
This year more than a thousand cases of infection were reported in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions of hospitals, overfilling beds, overload of staff stopping diseases do not help, says the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places it is also stored on disinfectants.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in a man who got into the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious auto accident was released at home, but shortly thereafter he had to return with an MRSA infection and one major operation could not have been performed due to the bacteria found in his body so far.
By 10 December, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents had been reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveyillance, according to Karolina Böröczová, the prime minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents have been recorded in safe hospitals, others are not known.
Almost two thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilin, with a resistant gold staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries a third of the human nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g., inflammation of the neck, inflammation of the almonds, skin infections, early infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excessive degree or inappropriate, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics are highly resistant to antibiotics and are rapidly spreading in unresponsive hospital conditions.
In particular, in the case of temporary or permanent dysfunction of the immune system in patients with impaired body weight, low body weight, or in patients in years of age, serious hospital infections, such as morning infection or blood poisoning - sepsis, may cause.
According to the chief physician at St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, a similar infection is a daily practice in hospitals.
"The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the disease originator is not investigated."
Resisting Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the caretaker is treating them in rubber gloves and masks, and we need antibiotics to treat them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined whether the infection is present in their MRSA system, but it is not always possible to avoid infection.
Sampling is not in fashion
Most hospital infections caused by MRSA could be avoided, but current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favourable to prevent the emergence and spread of multi-resistant agents, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since these infections occur significantly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals receiving patients should be monitored and MRSA carriers isolated immediately.
However, sampling of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund this examination.
Most cases are detected if the patient suffers from an observable MRSA infection, said the primary of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has a strong recommendation for appropriate treatment of human medicine antibiotics and there is also a home directive for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
There is a need to strive for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, or microbiological examinations should be carried out to avoid resistance to drugs, but even hospitals do not follow this in all cases.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in the basic, respecting outpatient treatment, reported Karolina Böröczová.
He's saving himself on disinfectants.
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most frequently distributed among patients through medical personnel.
That's why he plays a very important role in hand washing and using gloves and masks, but even in hospitals, there are serious shortcomings.
MRSA is also transmitted by infusion and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröczová noted, we can also see that in hospitals that are in an unfavorable material situation, it saves on disinfectants, nurses are few, and patients are much more likely to develop infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are followed, such as infections can be shown to be less or further spread by the disease's originator can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents a huge expenditure for health insurance companies, which is why they fight against it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has written a program to prevent MRSA, with respect to reducing its occurrence.
The programme seems to be successful, according to published data, showing a declining trend in the incidence of MRSA infection in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) aims to prevent the emergence of multi-resistent disease agents (including MRSAs), with respect to hospital infections caused by these disease agents, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident wasn't drunk.
Official scientific assessment in the case of Police Captain XXII, the circuit causing the fatal accident, is complete.
It can be ruled out that the police captain XXIII of the circuit, who on Tuesday killed the walker and who in the meantime resigned from his office, would be driving under the influence of alcohol or intoxicating substances, informing the spokesman of the Supreme State Department of the capital city of Attila Morvai on Friday after an expert assessment of the case was completed.
The expert's report confirmed the result of an initial investigation, which has already found that the former police captain had no alcohol before he took up the wheel.
The then Director of Police Directorate XXII of the district crashed on Tuesday at Lajos Kossuth Street in XXII. by his own personal car when he turned a five-year-old man who entered the front of him when he crossed the road outside the marked crossing.
(The last known fact that the walker passed outside the zebra, after all, according to road traffic rules is not a mitigating circumstance, the turning car must still give priority.)
After the transfer to the hospital, the walker died.
As a result of these events, the district police director resigned and requested a transfer to the service, according to the police report, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest State Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated from the start with State agents conducting the investigation.
Other €400 million on infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks totalling EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy, was signed by the Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved Hungary's budget financing of transport and environment projects implemented by Cohesion Fund, with a 300 million euro framework, with the parties already entering into a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, the signed agreement now concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A credit agreement worth EUR 150 million is also used to finance projects linked to education.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for these purposes, and the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a 50 million euro contract, which the budget will apply mainly to the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting there was also talk of the 4th metro route.
The Parties have agreed that once Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the metro, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
According to János Verese, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded €8.4 billion in total in Hungary since 1990. 113 projects.
The interest on loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real EU paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is impressive - the attention of Europe as a whole is turning to a previously neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who are still buying the cheapest yet, but fast-tracking EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European goal of real estate purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
From the mountains are the most in the area of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate around Kavarna and Balčík.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, investors will be interested in the central part of the country sooner or later - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more investors are also buying in the vicinity of the low-cost city of Russia.
Sofia's capital is also a promise of tempting opportunities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best track to turn into one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, and thus become next to the summer and winter seasons sought the goal of travel even in the next two years.
Foreseeing investors are already shopping in large places, such as around Banska.
According to analysts, buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyle.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and more often also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, by the Black Sea and in skiing paradises, then there are traditionally many Russian customers.
The foreign buyer of the les is divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settled people buy either renovated properties worth €50-100,000, or wasteful old houses for €5-15 000, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication, and it is important for them to be close to a large city, shops, and generally a local doctor.
The second categories are buyers chat (Bulgaria ranks among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of rising value in the medium- or long-term horizon.
Property disposal in the capital is continuous, as demand is increasingly strong.
Although the lowest prices for real estate in the European Union are in Bulgaria, over the past five years, they have increased by 21 percent annually.
Increases in property prices significantly exceed salary growth.
Fodor and Hungarian six percent
According to the Minister of Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor will be closed the expert meeting on Tuesday and the international conference on the climate regime will continue to meet with ministers after the mid-term official launch.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world are talking about a road map from Bali, which resolves efforts after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force by 2012.
At the moment, they are being debated in a storm between developing and advanced countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not wish to speak of precise figures now, although it adheres to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 due to the state of 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries will contribute, in addition to reducing emissions, to both material and technological assistance to countries that are referred to it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund provided for in the Kyoto Protocol will be administered by 16-member management board, most likely within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the magazine Piac és Profit.
Hungary's six percent
The Minister of Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in the effort to achieve global climate protection and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, irrespective of the success of the agreement after 2012, and is ready to commit to a 30 per cent reduction if other developed countries, as well as other developed countries, are willing to accept responsibility and commitments corresponding to their potential.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had a 5.2 per cent reduction target, with the 15 EU Member States then committed themselves to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the 1985-87 flights, which our country will fulfil. - is recalled in the Ministry of Environment's press release.
In Bali, much is involved, as an international agreement on long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would have changed with certainty only in 2012. In such a case, the commitments to the reduction established by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be accompanied by a new emission reduction system, the need for which, in its latest report, the UN International Climate Change Scientific Council, IPCC, which is the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting YouTube
British military units publish video sharing recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan that popularize themselves.
First of all, YouTube has been promising British Air Force (RAF): Special units operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of Taliban events since March 2006 and has announced BBC.
Recordings taken by a miniature camera mounted on the helmet are controlled by the Air Force Command to manage the fighting operation in the area of Kandahar and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable
In this form, more than 139 recordings of British air force soldiers were received on the Internet and more than 75,000 people looked at their channel.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Incursions in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original intention for recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defence they are good even to inform the general public of the real objective of the military presence abroad.
"Promotions published in this form in contrast to traditional television advertising are hardly worth anything," said BBC Defence Specialist Gordon Mackenzie, "but it is also necessary to carry a political message in itself, as the special form confirms the validity of the military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made a game.
The army is concerned that alongside carefully modified, censored recordings, amateur videos are also made on the server, including the death of soldiers: in a little hypocritical, "official" promotional films, the officers at the very least talk about losses, but the bloody form of combat is not exaggerated.
After all, many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan have been released on the Internet, which was created during the sharp deployment, but the British army has only come to them now.
Americans recruit a little differently - by using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can get through a more or less faithful simulation directly into the skin of soldiers.
There's gonna be Christmas with a tombol and parrots at the ministries.
The Minister of Labour, Monika Lamperth, is obviously not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold a final working meeting for his co-workers, where he will say goodbye to the coffee and spaghetti.
In some ministries, a lively music celebration will be held, and the official will be enchanted with the Christmas atmosphere with a tumbol and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - so they enjoy power.
The state authorities are preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence will hold the most detailed ministerial Christmas celebration this year, but it does not expect its employees.
Children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts on Christmas mornings, at Missionary Christmas feasts family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also organize receptions for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be kicked out of the mines against other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, with a total of 4,320,000 forints and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected of six hundred employees of the Ministry.
The resort will follow the Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will be various performances and also a tambola.
Christmas NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Judicial Council (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the program.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas celebration: this will be hosted by a tenr company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) of EU money.
To this end, they rented the Vígszínház theatre building.
The MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we failed to reach the person concerned.
No need for clothing
The OIT building was not hosted only by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the St. Lucie dance on December 7th.
However, OIT did not want the money from him using its rooms.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party began with a health minister, after dinner it was possible to dance for live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball, there were no mandatory evening dresses or suits at all.
The Puritan party is preparing health resorts, jobs and local governments.
The Ministry of Health organises a program and celebration for employees of 400,000 forints in their own building.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth even officially does not invite his co-workers to a Christmas party, but at the final working meeting.
There are a hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, receive only coffee and spaghetti, so only 350,000 forints will be available for the party.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajani, and his co-workers will simply toast in the Aule of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas reunion, which is expected by 436 workers, in its own large hall.
At Christmas party there are 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and toast.
Since Minister János Veres celebrates PM employees in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, the officiality strengthens not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon.
The Agricultural Resort organizes a New Year's reception on January 20th, the Ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place in the castle Vajdahunyadvár in the city orchards and, according to the Ministry's announcement, 1,000 forints are assigned per person for a hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception for which only the relevant foreign diplomatic accreditations in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief health minister and end with a small visit.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Christmas party do not hold at all, informed the portal [origo] of the relevant press department.
The cost of Christmas celebrations of the resort of the environment in the press department could not be reported.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Art Industry Museum.
He's headed for a giant strike.
The Association of Trade Unions of the League, respecting the National Union of Works Councils (MEASZ), will set up its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's unlimited posts.
On Saturday there is a protest public assembly, on Monday - on the day of final vote on the Health Insurance Act - work will be stopped.
The actions will certainly cause serious interruptions in transport, as rail transport will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, he will meet the League association together with the National Union of Works Councils with the details organized together by Monday's stations.
There will also be a strike commission LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's action.
The protest public assembly takes place on Saturday, and since Monday the unions joining the strike stop work for an indefinite period unless an agreement with the government is reached.
This means that no expiry date was set, which begins on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament did not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions would immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the legislation is voted out, the strike committee will meet and decide on another procedure.
According to the Monday agenda of Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on in late evenings or in the evenings.
Due to the start of the strike on Monday, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: on the railway the work will be stopped indefinitely, on the morning a part of Budapest public transport may be stopped and more than half of Volán.
At the same time, in many places the country also closes half the roadway.
Numerous trade unions and civil organisations have joined the challenge of the strike, the list of which has been continuously updated on the League’s website.
Some organisations audited the strike for an indefinite period, others reported temporary suspension.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railway (MÁV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZZZZ) were unable to agree on adequate services, while at the beginning of Christmas holidays they travel through the railway more and more people.
According to current reports, from the start of operation to 13 hours BKV, from 7 to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, the four-hour strike will be organised by the Committee of Workers in the energy industry LIGA, by the 2-, respecting the 2-8 hour stop of the Committee of Educators and the Democratic Union of Educators.
The association of Hungarian doctors will strike alternately throughout the country, the Democratic Trade Union of Health Workers and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Co-operation Forum of Trade Unions (SEZF), organizes a two-hour strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the Association of the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for a health insurance reform and submit a new concept to the public debate.
The second requirement is that a new method of calculating pensions be introduced gradually from next year.
Third, in the case of early retirement for the relevant work areas, the possibility of joining the system before 2010 is ensured.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZZZZZ), which is part of the League's trade association, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the railway branch and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased the risk of the country
The activity of the Hungarian Guards, founded with the support of the movement of Jobbik Magyarországért in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Institute of Political Capital increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole region in several respects.
The "risk alert" developed by the company states: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is that "to address the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary can occur in a short period of time as well as violent ethnic clashes".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to provoke such an action - it adds to the research institute.
According to the report, all of this can be explained by one of the biggest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: "The public debate on the Roma issue was left to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who were able to put up a political strategy in the Roma-Madgerian dispute."
This problem deepens, hinders normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the institute judges.
In addition, the Hungarian Guard's activities, according to the research institute, influenced by the great attention of domestic and foreign media "to a large extent corrupted the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity".
The Institute recalls: a part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-regulatory groups, which has been gaining more publicity and weight since the fall of 2006, is that several organisations have been established in Hungary since 2007 which themselves are referred to as "national militias".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while they openly declare - and armed - the willingness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the case of natural disasters, attacks of the country, disturbance of order), in addition, pointing to the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
It further notes: all of this is happening in a way that tries to wrap up various political efforts built against society's opposition to politics and the parties to civilian clothes.
Thus, the emphasis on civility and the form of society in the case of these groups does not only serve to avoid the legal disadvantage of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard's activities are also responsible for increasing the risk in terms of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, they point to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, ultranationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries by appealing to the formation of the Hungarian Guards want to excuse their own anti-Madja policy.
All this can affect the political stability of the area," it adds.
According to the Institute of Research, the formation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, thus increasing the political risk to the area as a whole.
According to the Hungarian Guard activity, for example, the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, the creation of which was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-regulatory Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roma riots that broke out in one of Sofia's districts (Krasna Poljana).
She used that BNU to set up a guard with the organization's goal being "national domain".
In the past 17 years, however, it is believed that there has been a "cyclical terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remains inactive and indifferent, reminds the Institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative sparked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
According to the report, an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by certain Bulgarian Roma organisations that they will create their own guards for signs of resistance.
Since Hungary's current activities show similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard activity, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma will also react in a similar way by setting up their own militia, we can read in the warning of the risks posed by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhašz, research director of the Institute of Political Capital: risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, risk analysis is published each year and, if it finds anything that could affect a change in risk, they shall inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, days of freedom are laid down by law and it has already become common practice that working days are being moved around holidays, which is less than expected for us next year.
In the European Union and in America, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and days of working peace.
Rest of life usually refers to church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is free work - for the New Year so that people can rest after Silver.
During the year, we have 11 free holidays in total.
The national holiday is the 15th March celebrating the revolution of 1848 and 23rd October, the memorable day of the 1956 revolution.
20 August we celebrate the establishment of the State, 1 May work, 1 and 2 November we remember dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two days of Easter, Summer and Christmas.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays are rarely scheduled for the weekend, the practice of moving a day’s work in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that we are staying at the workplace and at school on the previous Saturdays.
When the day immediately precedes or follows the holiday, we have worked out how long it has been for years to adjust the Minister of Labour's special decree.
The legal regulation applies equally to all employers and their employees, public servants and public servants.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or in view of their intended use even during working hours.
This year, there will be a change of working order just around the holidays at the end of the year: since 24 December, life in the country will almost stop because, according to experience, most people have spent a few days between Christmas and New Year's Eve before "working up" or this way they will enjoy a saved holiday.
Next year it's just a few of our holidays in the middle, respectfully at the end of the week, so the shifts of the workday will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around the holiday work so that the workers can stay home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, will be a day of rest.
The next move is due to the 23rd of October: on Saturday 18th October, the work will take place on Friday 24.
At the end of the year, however, the next year will be able to take place entirely in the sign of the holidays, because as of December 24, they will have almost a nonstop holiday everywhere, despite the fact that Silvest is on Wednesday.
Six scary little things you can upset your colleagues.
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies that we'll almost never notice: it all "specifys" every day in the workplace.
The question is, if you get used to these minor inconveniences, or if you put on gloves and unclear situations that may upset others, you will deliberately avoid them.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
Is that why you missed your party?
In a better case, he regrets and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says that he has forgotten to send the message (that is a less usual solution).
Most of the time, the thing is solved with an apology.
Before it comes to embarrassing apologies, it is good to think about what you colleagues could do to prepare unpleasant moments, and, consciously, try to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than stretching for some writing, office needs, or your phone, and not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover on the table one of your colleagues your pens that you thought were lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll be right to be angry with you about being a mess with them.
Do not take envelopes or paper from your office because it may be uncomfortable when you arrive early, and you will need them immediately.
Drby about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop the spreading rumours.
Who, who, what did he do with?
Where and why?
Don’t put your news (domen) on everyone’s nose about the private lives of colleagues!
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock what you have heard in yourself, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, nor when others know his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and recall the severe headache, you report your absence because you are not well, or you say that you would rather rest today, think that your work, urgent tasks and work, which have a certain deadline, will have to be done for you by someone else.
Take note of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work, or that something can happen that will make you have to stay home, please report that your colleagues and supervisors are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
shaving, pantyhose, phone calls
Did you dive into a job where you're rudely torn out by the humming of a fellow?
You didn't want to witness a phone conversation that would be better off without even hearing it?
Don't disturb your coworkers by vomiting, singing, loud phone calls (up top of my head), or squealing, constantly kneeling, loud discontent.
All of this can be disruptive even when they are not in a project (writing, planning, organization).
You're accusing the other one of being wrong?
If something is not timely or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame your forgetfulness to the other!
Do not appeal to possible chaos in the office and deaf fellows!
Recognize that if you were wrong and someone paid for it, and correct the damage!
Ask yourself how you can put things in order, correct negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Cutlery and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, however, are not suitable in the office!
Don't wear your free time clothes, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be careful, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in your regular dress - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When one wants to please, one ceases to be interesting
Riding in the usual morning jam.
A special melody will be heard from the radio: the sound of the violin to which the electronic effects are connected.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes the pace and adds bass to the previous tone coloring, then joins the women's congregation as a true jewel.
There's a song by Zagar called Wings of Love at the station.
The home life of music has long not just spoiled us with a quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the jam looks a little different, because you're just listening to the new album by Zagara.
The revelation of Yonderboi, a few new and interesting productions from home digital underground slowly changes the overall picture, although again in fashion the garage rock with its beating into guitars, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Baláz Zságer started in the Peticostelj and he also played at the Yonderboi band until finally - perhaps because two of the students did not enter the same bar - he made his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that connects jazz elements, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to pierce until he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film by Ference Török "Szezon").
His formation, played in the beginnings of smaller clubs, was met by a wider audience after van2 listed their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important home boards and declared Zagar in Yonderboie as almost the only domestic entities determining developments that could be commercial in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt "in the course", although no one has asked them, of course, if they are satisfied with this sticker.
The band reacted as they were: it made a new, better album.
Now a released album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the name itself is trying to create a link with the initial flights in the Peticostel.
It is one of the songs of the older band Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the etheric, flying would be in place, but next to the etheric breath of this music appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time - louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, a singer, György Ligetti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, was introduced at the premiere of the Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, which recently played from morning till evening of popular music, we began to be plagued by the fangy tunes of Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's okay?
The hvg.hu portal spoke to Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question remains, how much do you play, marginal music?
Baláz Záger: The definition of peripheral music doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and that's how it can only come about by selling it, which makes it commercial.
Of course, even a good pop song can spring from an honest inner need.
In this spirit, too, the attitude taken, regardless of language and national boundaries, works.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people who attend concerts after twenty, but also older people.
Many more watch the transformations of light music around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and how much of your music you listen to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
Music isn't born for a purpose, it's born for a reason.
The role of the audience can be seen rather at concerts, where the influence of each other is already working, but it is hidden only in the inconclusive changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that when a person wants to meet an audience, he has stopped being interesting ever since.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He's working solo, and he's built his career more of a Westerner than we are.
B. Zs.: We are not really his way, regardless of how our music sometimes tries to explain.
Rather, we are team players who rely on the music presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was not possible to avoid comparing our work to Yonderboi's compositions, because several of us separated from his band and went on a different path.
hvg.hu: In the heating station mr2 Petőfi the song Wings of Love won first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular way, have you consciously opened up to the wider layers?
B.Z.: We weren't planning on writing a hit to sell the board.
There's more to the song.
We thought of it as the final album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
Hvg.hu: How did you pick those six singers?
Why is it - what was the principle?
B.Zs: The idea was to create such a hospitable congregation.
Then came the idea of building this choir from the soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member congregation was assembled - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Boris Péterfy, Enikő Hodos [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then crossed into the Underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: That's how you intended the song, or did the girls do something about it?
B.Zs: The composition has long existed in the instrumentation version, when the material came together on the board, we thought that something else would be needed for this composition.
A trail of chords led him to join the singing party.
The other night, I sang a melody on him that later girls learned.
It all worked out almost for the first time and so spontaneously.
I remember how it came back, but, of course, Diva needed it.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that way.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and at the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They do not have solos (except Judy Jay), they do not have their own roles, they sing together, and they are not louder than music, so music only does not accompany their singing.
Also on stage were standing in the back.
Is that on purpose?
B.Zs: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
On the contrary, the fact that we didn't want to divide solo roles is deliberate.
And the song is about us forgetting our egos a little bit, from where it belongs, and just to let those wings get us up and up.
I wished this euphoric condition, which we felt when the song was born, could be felt by others.
hvg.hu: Who was the most involved?
B.Zs.: In fact, during the composition of music with no one, the heavier pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I'm playing on a concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for a long time, then everything slowly found its place in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which new record is your favorite?
B.Z.: This is still changing by the concerts and the fact that I've already released the board.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous broker risked billions of undervalues
Proud defraudant.
That's how he describes his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Commercial Bank.
She lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to settle down with his colleagues and, in addition, certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all large banking houses, he recognized the early crisis on the US mortgage market.
"He's mentally weaker," sounded out of his superiors' mouth, who sent the police to him.
However, as Kerviell’s statement to the French media, such as Le Monde, shows, was a person who at the end of last year had a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in a statement.
In the summer, he was able to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He felt the occasion at the beginning of the year.
In February news began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had problems with repayment in the past, would have problems.
But she didn't have any impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet it right.
At the end of the year, his profits rose to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I made the first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," he admits, adding that he certainly didn't leave anything for himself.
He admits in all his interrogations that he faked his records so that they wouldn't come at him.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though Eurex was interested in his business.
Risk was profit.
Was he afraid he'd come after him?
Not really.
"I thought that just the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to develop himself gradually in his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a single broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never make as much money as the others did.
"I already knew on my first interview in 2005 that they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after the onset, the first great success came.
Allianz made a profit by taking part in the London bombings, for he was putting half a billion euros behind him in this title.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you go.
"It's like snowballs," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew all about it, or they were snooping.
"As long as I was making money, they closed my eyes."
But then came the wound at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After a half-January weekend, he tried to destroy it.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect for his vacation.
"I only picked four days last year.
A broker who doesn't have a vacation is a broker who doesn't want anyone watching his records," Kerville concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission yesterday, from which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
About half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation programme.
The biggest money, up to 150 billion, will be headed for transport.
Transport is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will host CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovation.
Firms should receive funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful countries to date in drawing money from EU funds.
Twenty-year sentence for President Nicaragua confirmed the court
The Nicaraguan appeal court confirmed on Thursday a 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnold Alemán, sentenced to $100 million in 2003 for financial fraud (less than 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison on his househouse near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 returns behind bars, according to AP, it is currently unclear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will now depend on prison officials to let Alemán serve his sentence at home or to go to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that he had regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious, and the accounts belonged in fact to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund which Alemán founded to fund his election campaign in 2001.
That's how they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What is the special purpose of this budget?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This one went through this year with the support of the ČSSD because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the busy debate before the government's vote of distrust, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The House of Deputies traditionally ignored, although the most influential, the law peacefully approved.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the power struggle of the government with the opposition.
This is mediaally more grateful, and this is why much more attention is given to it in the media.
The idea of politicians is more interesting to the public than strict numbers.
State budgets in past Social Democratic governments suffered three setbacks, which for 2008 was unable to resolve at once:
The first is a high share of the law of compulsory, i.e. mandate expenses, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits approved last year by the silent "coalice" of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit of the management as a result of the failure of the first.
The third limit is public finance deficits, i.e. deficits in urban and municipal budgets.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It's public and relatively under control.
However, the time bomb is a deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to tax money, fees and loans from banks, receive additional resources for investment, often headlessly issue bonds that they unduly indebted to their councils.
In recent years, they have managed to pay these debts by mass sales of shares of energy and other divorce networks that they have received from the state of privatisation.
Now they don't have that source.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through the rest of the world for several years, as has the growth phase, which constantly boasts the ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state was increasingly in debt.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have provided a much more reasonable economy than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls primarily on the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been totally unnecessary in terms of gigantic proportions.
Even if part of the senseless populist expenditure approved this year before the elections were cancelled, so if the retirement and pension reform threshold did not come to an end in the near future, then any politics in this country will actually end and whoever rules in this way will simply be in office.
With a small ceiling, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the tax money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the normal spending from being pushed out by the mandate.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments did not manage what they could in the last 10 years.
If we do not want to make it a reality that officials will become the ruling politicians, then we must be patient and support this very strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and fees, calm down to prepare other reform laws.
Only these will allow for a gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to solve the crisis.
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight the crisis on the financial markets together.
Thus, more than a hundred billion dollars will be spent on currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the banks auction the interest rate for which they are willing to borrow the money.
For example, the American Fed will send $40 billion to the auction, and another forty-four will make the European and Swiss central banks available.
It is after the attacks of 11 September for the first time that the central banks of the individual States agreed on such a coordinated process to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is to address the biggest economic difficulties, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group advised clients in his report.
"Coordinated actions by central banks have reduced the probability of recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what else might follow when they decided on this procedure," ABN's main economist Amro Kieran Davies said.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with potential impacts on the economic growth of the world.
Thus, the central banks decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutual lending of money, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as the next drop in interest rates," said Tempus Consulting to Reuters Greg Salvaggio.
Some analysts do not believe that the step of central banks will contribute to the recovery of the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, which is the collapse of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: The environmental debate is incredible
Global climate change is intended to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again addressed the issue of global warming.
Critics have now dropped at the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not the green planet, he said that environmental debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, the non-acceptable structure of the conference, which forms a strange mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organisations, is also a fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompany it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just an fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that its theme was very important to him and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the book appeared also in German translation, because, as he said, "I often meet only the cartoons of my opinions".
So now the students can read his undiscovered attitudes.
Klaus reminded us that although he is not a climate scientist, in his opinion, he has enough prerequisites for writing such a book.
Because he is an academic who is able to monitor and assess expert bargaining, has experience with statistics and is also a national master.
The main conclusions of the book are that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent view of all scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, inefficient and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a person with totalitarian experience, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly explained on the questions at hand that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
On the same subject Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
The driver couldn't replace 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed their deadline and could not exchange an old driving licence that expired at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can ask for an exchange so that the authorities can still issue a new card to them by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would be on the road after the New Year without a valid permit.
According to the authorities, those who don't even want to drive were not replaced.
While the municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of drivers, the metropolis offices are flooded with requests and interest in the exchange of the licence increased this week.
The Magistrate is delivering about 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in the queues.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not been replaced by a driver’s license.
The issue of a new licence takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request publication within a limited period of five days.
In that case, the driver will pay for five hundred crowns.
Engineers who fail to make the exchange of the licence by the end of the year and will be on the road without a valid driver will be subject to fines from January.
The prosecutor will pay up to two thousand crowns.
A policeman can also deal with a crime by contract.
In the event of administrative misconduct, fines shall be raised to 2,500 crowns.
According to earlier information, he could have gotten a ticket from the town hall and a man who wasn't going anywhere.
He may have paid 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had previously called upon the authorities to be mild and to impose a maximum of a thousand kroner fines.
According to the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karl Hanzelka, ten thousand fines are no threat to anyone.
The driver’s license is, according to him, a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It's not a civil card that everyone has to have valid.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It shall be carried out or sent by mail to the competent municipal authority.
By the end of the year they will cease to pay the licences issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driver's licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will end in December 2013.
Hanzelka says it's about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentences of detectives associated with Berdych.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňářík, who are charged with criminally associating with David Berdych’s gang, will go to jail for 13 and 10 years.
With definitive effect, the Prague Supreme Court ruled on this, which reduced their sentences by one year and the other by two years.
It was originally a threat to the detectives of the Prague Committee for Combating Organized Crime for 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal to today's decision, it is possible only to appeal to the Supreme Court.
While Berdich is also accused of this causation, he is waiting for the original verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences in the sum exceeding 16 years.
That's all he can get.
The Regional Court in January recognised, in particular, the participation in 19 wine thefts, the Supreme Court today ruled that 16 of them had been appealed.
Most of the defendants refused to be charged from the start of the investigation with the fact that it was a constructed caussis.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, by agreement, among other things, with Berdych, provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered up the individual robbery and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
Gang took 30 percent off the barrel for Opava and Horseman.
The prosecution refers to the criminal activity of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robbery, many victims of serious harm to health, but also abuse of public authority and illicit weapons.
At home visits, police discovered illegally held pistols, bullets with steel cores, laser sightings, or self-imposed guns.
Gang's charged with burglary for tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to almost 20 men in this trial, the courts have already held the courts guilty of other Berdikh robberies and a number of other people.
Other men in the area of Berdych have yet to testify in another trial, some of the causations have not yet been brought to trial.
The main treatment has so far been avoided by Tomáš Pótov and Maroši Šulej, who are in Irish custody, where they are awaiting a definitive decision on their issuance for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Child replacement account: 12 million
In exchange for children in childbirth, Igor Veleb's family lawyer wants 12 million crowns in damages after the Trebích hospital, plus court fees.
For each of the mothers after three million, for the father after two million and for the children by the million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for every parent.
The legal representative of the hospital Ondřej therefore disagreed with the Veleby proposal.
"We refuse such a request, it is very high," he said after today's meeting.
"But in order for us to have an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert assessment that the opponent has made.
Let's see if he's worth anything.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds for everyone," said the Dostal.
The amount should, according to him, be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the bond, the Jablonov family wanted a million crowns for every month she did not raise her biological daughter.
Veleb served as a basis for negotiations on compensation expert judgement prepared by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Parents of children, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, have suffered psychological harm and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better faced by men, even though they were faced with the regrets that the replacement of newborns had not been prevented.
Women are at a disadvantage again with the updated trauma and with what is happening right now, he has summarised the content of Veleb.
Veronica and Nikola switched nurses in a slumming maternity ward last December 9 December.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermákov do Pribyslavic and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojanová to Jablonová.
Heitman Vysočina Miloš Vysočiný handed out, at the end of October, 100,000 crowns each of the families to compensate for expenses incurred by them by the error of the slum hospital which the region set up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured under the law for liability for damage.
In case of doubt they must reach the reserve fund, they may exceptionally request the assistance of the founder.
The courts have so far awarded people relatively low compensation, the sums were calculated according to the tables in the order of the thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
A soup has lost the Kingdom of Valaš
Bolek Polivka lost the argument about the brand of the Valaš Kingdom.
Although for the first time, according to the judge in Ostrava’s Regional Court, the king of Wales used the designation, but the project built a long-term team around Thomas Harabis, who worked with the actor.
The soup did not participate today.
According to his lawyer, the bail will probably not end and the client will withdraw.
"The issue is that Mr. harabis and his team are parasites in the popularity of Bolka Políva," said the Polish lawyer after the process.
According to him, everyone in the Valaš Kingdom has just got the actor and the comedian.
The same is true of Harabish.
"There is almost a decade of work behind us.
Finding money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could have something of it.
They want to parasite on our work," he added.
Lupraous business
According to the court, the king of Walas used Polívka for the first time in his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzorichý.
At that time, however, it was not connected with the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, harabis came up with the idea of issuing Welsh passports.
From the original recession, business and lucrative business activities were included, to which Harabish established the Kingdom of Valaš.
In 1997, Polívka agreed with the introduction of his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also stated that Harabish had only taken advantage of the bare idea that Polívka had published in the manoeuvre for his business intention.
"Pularity of Boleslav Polika's Valaš Kingdom project certainly helped," she told the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team, who was working hard for him.
The cooperation of the decomposed parties today continued until 2000, when Harabiš organised an official coronation for Polívka in Vetín.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polívka and Harabish that culminated in the planting of "the queen of Boleslav I chosen to go on a journey".
The Kingdom’s leading role was then captured by the singer Jarmila Shulaková as the queen’s mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an action against Harabis and his company, which the court rejected today.
It would be clear that it would bring Harabish to the dispute a ready-to-go curse on the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal the details or the dates.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be like riding kings on a slovak.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polivka can sign in, too," said Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Vanishing Prejudice
To be honest, I've never done much for Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not much, the quality of sorting, steering and production could also be described as sub-average.
But there's now a successor to Peugeot 207 on the market, and it's much better.
And a van called SW goes a little further and I'm not left to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of Peugeot 207, I complained about, for example, backseat space.
That's the end of the complaint here, because the caroserie van means they won't suffer in this direction even a two-meter long.
In the summer of the world
I'm going to cross the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself.
It's a pretty well-designed design, where I have the only bulge for a poor middle tunnel.
Here, I'd appreciate a little more design investment if the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backs.
Side conduct has also significantly improved against model 206.
As for space, there is also an increase in body size.
In the van, the already mentioned lack of space is disappearing.
BaggageComments
So the main thing in this car is his trunk.
It must be regarded as very accessible (even thanks to the latching back window) and as decently consistent.
Deaf places are equipped with restraints, which are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't prevent it from stretching out, and it keeps heavy objects.
But let's stop by the volume together.
This is based on the table in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is rather an average value against competition.
However, not against in the Czech Republic the most sold car of this class - Škodu Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging behind a lot of 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I were to raise the positive, I still have to mention the straight floor after the second-line or very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a four-cylinder with a volume of 1.6 l with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old should look like, that drives a family hatchback.
She's quiet, she's low-consumption, and she's mostly pulling.
If I compare to her the kind of pest that sometimes acts like she's got a stuffed rag in her exhaust, I can only be thrilled with it.
The pricelist will indicate
The price of the car is not human.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with ignition 14 for 329 900 CZK will still go away.
Our aggregate is worth $410,900, which is quite enough.
Tested equipment Premium then throws equipment for an additional 80 000 CZK above.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic spraying, electric rear window control...
It's just a car worth all 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the additional equipment at Fabi's and you get a very similar number.
So there's no choice but to make a decision about the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools failed
Children from Eastern European countries are arriving at British schools, which raises concerns about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hit a number of obstacles so far.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the native peoples escalate into violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
The fights, the bullying and the fighting between the pupils have also moved into relations between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham the police detained a Slovak woman who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
Provincially, the boy insulted her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls of men allegedly celebrated with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, some boy climbed up to the bus stop and started swimming at us.
When I told him to let it go, he leaned on us with apples and pears, and then he exposed his ass," the mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the locals even marked disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the struggle for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to become tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who came here for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students then attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it is indeed an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can come true if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a pond.
Palmy and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you can find it in a complete and richer calculation.
Only on one island, but you will find even more and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antil.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus named it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasure translation facility that the Spanish in America had raided and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the end of 20.
He let one of the U.S. mob bosses Lucky Luciano build him because everything in the U.S. was a crime (particularly prohibition) was welcomed and promoted in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall houses grew up, and cars were driving around the broad boulevards that belonged to the cult symbols of the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a seat in San Francisco de Paula, a short distance from Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Media they left their signatures of the star showbusiness and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of Havana Bodeguita you can leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, you will be mixed with a cocktail according to your wishes.
And the cult cars from the 1950s are still driving around Havana because once imported squiggly and fiats in the salty and wet air have long since rotted.
Whether Havana, in particular the oldest part of her, is largely tainted, yet nowhere around is so many beautiful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are turning into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much needed money, its development has green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but in particular in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province and on the islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers yet another cubit, which is unique in the world, and will especially be appreciated by trainmakers.
Three of the extensive plantations brought steam and motor trains to sugar mills on narrow tracks.
Their car park has not been renovated for many decades, and so there are machines that work there that are only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba will not miss.
And so there's no need to write about Varadero, or about Havana.
Perhaps just to remind you that in the already mentioned Hemingway residence there is a museum, and whoever likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Vinjales Valley One of Cuba's most picturesque corners is the Vinjales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the calcium base.
The moguls, limestone homoles and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley, and in their hollows a fertile earth has been laid down, which also makes the windy rocks covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where Cuban tobacco is probably the most quality.
With its final appearance you can meet if you visit one of the Havana factories for the production of cigars.
Someone might find it interesting that there was a Chilean part of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him a slave and sugar trade.
The wealth has become the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has not changed for four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray, is a place so remote that there was no road between the rest of the country in the 1950s.
She isolated him, helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was done, and everyone was glad to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at even interesting places nearby, such as Playa Ancón beach, or the Cucrovar Valley.
In the evening it is necessary to go to Casa de la Musica, who lives after dark and music in it escapes over the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
That is the true view of the road itself.
Both of the roads that lead there from Guantanamo must cross the high and divided mountains and pass through nature, which human activity has hardly marked.
The east island of Cuba has registered UNESCO thanks to its unbroken nature on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have Columbus Cross (in fact it was about a hundred years after Columbus cruise) and from the hill where the castle and today's El Castillo Hotel stands, there are several capital mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, about the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, about the Holy Cuban Patrons Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, African religions that recognize the descendants of former slaves, all of this could be described by many pages.
But, as they say correctly, you'd better see once.
Allied in Afghanistan are passive, tough Americans.
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment affect the United States' response to the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence, Robert Gates should plan a concrete plan for next years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not run according to ideas, the representatives of the countries that have units in the southern part of the country agreed in Scotland.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban movement, eight participating States are today also discussing other plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through the Defense Minister Robert Gates, called on NATO units to become more active, the UK sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"The occupation in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to enable the residents to start further development of the economy and security themselves," said British Defence Minister Des Browne at BBC Station.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has been the highest in the past five years, according to data from the US Army.
The number of violent acts rose by 27 percent last year, in the southern Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO has about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to seriously consider specific objectives for the next time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar sense today.
"I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," said Reuters De Hoop at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
There have also been disputes among the participating countries in recent months as to whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For instance, Germany was criticized for passivity.
"The Germans have quite numerous representations in Afghanistan.
They are, however, set up in areas where violence is minimal and combat claims are not as high as we are in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun marked German soldiers as sloths this week.
"Afghan Cavalry Discovered: The Germans play while our boys fight," wrote Sun in a material supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's Bild has gone into the anti-attack and has printed a shot of the British unit during a football game in southern Afghanistan.
The State debt will be repaid on a trillion in 2009
For every Czech, there is a government debt of over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government was planning to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to a better development of State budget management.
The Czech Republic's state debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, the crowns have decreased by 13.4 billion.
Thus, the Ministry of Finance today confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
For every Czech, there is a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that due to the lower deficit for the next year, we could cross the border of the trillion crown only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and trillion crowns," said analyst Patria Finance David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, analyst Next Finance Vladimír Pikora sees this: "To exceed one trillion we could get through 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move on to 2010.
But I do not suppose this change," he said.
Debt grows.
The government's debt consists of central government debt and is mainly due to the accumulation of government deficits.
The State debt is financed by treasury contracts, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The country's internal debt has so far risen by 38.5 billion this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state’s foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called tradeable state debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and dropped by CZK 13.7 billion in June.
The average sovereign debt repayment increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 per cent over the first to third quarters in the year, which is really a lot to do with the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in bonds, where there is an increase of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that it will deal with what it will deal with when pension reform is here," said Pikora data.
Better than expected
The 2007 Finance and Debt Management Strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to a better development of State budget management.
The amount consists mainly of a deficit in the state budget, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
It is also the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, the ten-billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of government bonds of CZK 43 billion and loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
The woman is about to go to court today in Khartoum for giving her name to the bear bear.
A British teacher sentenced in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday evening by one of the Charter Tribunals, as her lawyer said.
The British accused her of letting six to seven - year - old pupils give the bear’s name Mohamed despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet Islam is forbidden.
She was punished with whipping.
This British four-year-old teacher, acting at the Unity High School in the Sudan Charter, was arrested at home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a class bear.
"There will be eight names from the mouth of the children, including Hassan, Abdulah and Mohamed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
After voting in the classroom, 20 out of 23 children will eventually choose Mohamed as the most popular name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but first of all, it is a very widespread Christian name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself had no label with this name on it, but the problem is in the very image of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knows her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith: "I regret only that she asked the children to vote for some name," according to him, it is only " innocent doubt".
Many teachers who describe it as "very considerate of their students" also share this view and add that "never in class talk about religion".
Recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second most frequently given Christian name in Great Britain, written in English in 14 different ways.
This Christian name is often chosen by Muslim families as a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this name?
For example, is it possible to give them to toys?
Sure, it's an interpretation question.
At the last round of negotiations, this centre in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanians finished their sixth and last round of talks on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome the different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach a status agreement," said European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to care for their commitments to keep peace and were ready to dialogue even after the negotiations ended.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period", he added, "it is evident that the situation is tense".
The negotiations shall end on 10 December
The Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be travelling to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 per cent of the Albanian-speaking population is made up, could be shown more clearly by December 10th, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and at the same time the final round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, has entrusted Troika with new negotiations.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the end of the talks on December 10th.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the UN Security Council, on the other hand, insist that the negotiations continue beyond this most recent deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated, compromise solution," said Bocan-Charchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence to be an independent solution under EU supervision.
The Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," said President Fatmir Sejdiu of Kosovo in the Baden Hotel, where this "last chance of dealing" has been going on since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former Kosovo Albanian rebel commander and future province prime minister, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Dominal Effect"
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tadić believes that the compromise is still under consideration and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to fear in particular the "dominal effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, however, that does not mean," he said, "that compromise is impossible".
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council in which its Russian ally has the right of veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, the only solution that comes from the Security Council is acceptable," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on status will be given by the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking residents, there would be a "agreement" with the West.
Bush made a deal on Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis in Maryland, convened on his impulse, American President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed on the immediate commencement of negotiations with the intention to resolve for 60 years the ongoing conflict between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised to do everything he could to help them conclude the "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said, and recalled the obligations for both parties from the "travel map" to the level they accepted in 2003.
Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas are aimed at "an end to a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues".
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of today's State of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the US President and stressed that the ensuing negotiations should be "total and thorough" and that all aspects of the solution should be touched by the reference to "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, safety, among other things".
Olmert then took the stand, which expressed the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it should be "planned to be concluded during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the date for his "vision of two states", Palestinian and Israeli, existing alongside each other.
Saudi Arabia announced that it had made a commitment from Bush in this sense before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success, initiated a proposal accepted by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories taken for war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East especially because it fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saúd in an interview which he gave to an Arabic-speaking diary protected by Saudi capital.
According to the D.A., the cops are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always happens in such small reports from the black chronicle, the official version does not match what people say.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car was passing on Sunday after 17:00 on Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in mode of intervention, but was on patrol and passed at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, without the side lights turned on," explains the police source.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered, and thus without permission to ride on public communications" (read below), controlled by two young people without helmet, passed "very high speed".
"The motorcycle crashed from the left side of the police car after not giving priority to the right," one policeman specified.
The blood promilion test on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (cut-out front, broken-down front window, fractured bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that IGN had entrusted the investigation of "unreasonable killings and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", who was also seized of the Directorate départementale de la sûreté publicque du Val-d'Oise (the Directorate of the Regional Police of the Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation led by IGPN excluded, at this stage, the responsibility of the police for the accident.
Three witnesses who were questioned on Sunday night confirmed by the official that the minimotor approached them relatively quickly on the left.
Some sort of rift, undoubtedly caused by the twirling of the ground, showed yesterday that the two vehicles remained shut down until the police car could stop.
The vehicles have been secured and undergo technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were carried out by an autopsy yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Beel, people were quickly told that policemen should leave the crime scene quickly without providing two young people with first aid.
The IGPN should, in all due care, also exclude "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which it is necessary to be very careful," pointed out a police source.
The daily "Libération" met with an eyewitness of those few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident occurred.
"As soon as we were with a cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, we ran down to try to resurrect them," this witness reports.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw a limping, totally scared cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with a rapidly rising tension and confidently present that the situation of young people was hopeless, the police were taken by the car by colleagues who had arrived in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left. "
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities did not rush to help young people.
First aid was granted to these young people.
The firemen came immediately.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Voltage Increases in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstration since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the town of Lahor, in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting measures taken in the context of a state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades which, according to witnesses, used orderly forces.
The last names answered with a stone, wounding several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenarios, such as in Karacza and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court called after a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning in order to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Mutana (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers gained the support of religious parties grouped in the political strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "strengthened the population to send flowers to the judges who stood up against the exceptional condition and the waste to those who made an oath before Musharraf".
"Musharaf's promise doesn't apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the target of a special measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to express the legitimacy of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election, which took place on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
"All we are witnesses is against the law, the constitutional and the judgments of the Supreme Court," said the official in The News.
Parviz Musharraf's promise to surrender his leadership and become a civilian president will not be paid after the establishment of an exceptional state, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up military uniforms until the 15th of November, when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In other words, the Pakistani government has rejected speculation in the country, according to which the military chief's deputy had to order President Musharraf's house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancy is still an unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is still unexpected today, it presents a study conducted by the French Institute national d'études détudes démographiques (Ined)- the State Department of Demographic Studies, 40 years after the adoption of the so-called Neuvirthov Act, which in France ordered contraceptives.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Various contraceptive methods, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the rate of failure, is estimated by Ined.
Contraception law has only allowed for better fertility control, says the constitution, and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between 20 and 44 years has now reached 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight out of ten are well planned today.
One in five has even been calculated on a month exactly, and as far as possible in spring, which is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of a child.
A Remarkable Repair of the Space Station
More than seven hours of work in space needed astronaut Scott Parazinski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform a remarkable repair of the fragmented solar panel necessary for the next scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky exit to the universe, which collected records as to the length of time, distance from the living modules, the speed at which it was planned and the degree of "contusion" that astronauts spent on repairing.
The difficulties appeared on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship interpreted the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is kind of a landing molar for mods-laboratory.
These, however, need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move the seventeen-a-half-year-old module producing electricity using solar panels already on the ISS to anchor in its final position.
After she moved it, the crew began to decompose the 75-foot solar panels of the module.
And there was one of the panels that was folding like a pull-up harmonica, resulting in a wire clamping, damaged on the surface almost one metre.
The unloading was suspended to prevent further panel damage.
Astronauts, who were originally to perform a control output on the Discovery ship, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazinski, who was chosen to fly to the end of the robot arm of a ship added to the arm of the station, and made repairs.
It's one of the best "spacewalkers" of the American Aviation and Space Authority (NASA).
He's tall, he's strong, he's very tough, he's got a very long chest and he's got long arms.
At 46 years of age, this original call was commissioned by a doctor to operate an "opposed" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the defective cable and fastened to damaged places of some kind of "forks".
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained close to the balance chamber, and also from the inside, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the commander of the crew.
The tools he used, a mini-hockey coated with an insulating device to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and produced by astronauts on board the station "after kutilski".
After the operation ended, Scott Parazinski waited for the panel to be completely decomposed and then inventoryed his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Last afternoon, astronauts took half a day's rest before today, when seven astronauts return to Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled.
EADS shares weaken
The EADS shares in the Paris Stock Exchange are being lost after the company operating in the aviation and defence industries have announced that it will have to spend EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion to face the delay of the A400M aircraft.
EADS has lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 due to delays in the slow progress towards the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the start-up flight.
The cost of reducing delays in the delivery of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was calculated "to 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European constructer EADS announced.
As a result of these costs, EADS will, next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, be forced to report a new profit outlook before deducting interest and taxes (EBIT).
The group also announced that the new cost estimate was being compared with a six-month delay.
Let us recall that the EADS production results decreased by 86 % in 2006 due in particular to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380 aircraft.
Originally, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft would be provided to the French army in October 2009.
Decision on status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without a tight expectation: the Russians will mostly elect President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming this, only very few free pre-election campaigns, their weight on stability and authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Members, Russian President Vladimír Putin informs voters at public offices of a pre-recorded television message whose contents are kept secret.
It is thus the position of the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremelian side, who seems to celebrate the crushing victory.
When the ambassadors of foreign states received yesterday, the president did not let anything out of him and satisfied himself with another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we wish for the most honest, possibly the most transparent and open elections, elections without the slightest defect in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not even close.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
The leader of the Communists Gennady Zjuganov says that "never had so dirty elections, nor for Jelcin".
After the repression of last weekend demonstrations, the former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned by his lawyers.
"Rusam remains a mentality homo sovietica"
In the background of these Parliamentary elections, the simple expectation profiles two far more open issues:
- "Who will become Putin's successor to the Presidential Office?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public by 23 December.
Vladimír Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot pursue a third mandate in a row.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Is he going to be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful parties of the United Russia, who chooses the government and the President?
Either way, the ruling power leaving will win the whole line in the parliamentary elections as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"Rusam remained a mentality homo soviet, does not feel the masters of his fate," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Sankt-Peterburg takes note of more time-stricken relationships: civil society has gained, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, delays; that famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s "Putin referred to the Patinic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than the terror but a certain economic well-being," Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation believes.
Today, the Russians are "willingly surrendering their personal responsibility", which was soon demonstrated after the collapse of the SSSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (from the total number of 85 heads of Russian regions) are managed by the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, like in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion favours stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not elect extremists.
The conclusion of Tamary Cherednichenko, four-year-old professors: "Why think?
Those in power aren't that bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which deal with the fates of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, open to the public.
47 million archival documents saved 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were only available in this period for a "humanitarian" purpose, which means individually and nominally, at the request of the former victim or its authorized persons.
Eleven States entrusted with the management of archives - between Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Given that the process of ratifying this agreement by all states is over, the opening yesterday took effect.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow them to explore "in particular the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of forced labour", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the expected homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or arrests drawn up by the Gestapo were collected after the war for a practical purpose to find the deported or forced work of subsidized civilian citizens, to bring proof of their internment in order to open the way of their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited contribution.
"There is nothing more to be expected of these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technische Universität in 2006.
EU and India want to achieve free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India has reached almost €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, announced European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
Last April, EU foreign ministers gave the green European Commission to start negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). The bilateral trade between Europe and India is now almost €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, up to the EU's ninth trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement will greatly overwhelm both economies" and "India will gain better market access of 450 million prosperous Europeans", reported Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India, specified by the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giant together annually will change "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that the bilateral trade "had not yet reached its full potential". On Friday, the EU and India meet at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England took note of concerns and offered £10 billion in five-week auction
On Thursday, the Bank indicated that it intends to alleviate current concerns about the worsening of credit market conditions again and announced a bid of 10 billion pounds in five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75 %, an offer that is unusually long.
"In an effort to alleviate fears that the conditions on the financial markets will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty in the manner in which to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she announced in a communication.
The Bank specifies that EUR 10 billion (14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at the GMT 12.15 until 10 January at the basic interest rate.
It seems that this is the first time that BOE pumps cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
It usually lasts a week.
BOE adds in its communication that "it remains ready to implement further measures to maintain interest rates" between bank loans at the same level with its base rate.
On Wednesday, the interbank interest rate was 5,829%.
The three-month interest rate has been established at 6,6 %, which is the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market have been linked by the Bank of England to the rates of charges which have discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the evolution of the euro exchange rate, many prefer to opt for sums placed on the European Central Bank's financial market with lower rates and guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un movement populaire, Union for People's Movements) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to consider Socialists' (PS) proposals on purchasing ability
The UMP and Nouveau Centre Clubs refused to discuss the various sections of the socialist bill on purchasing capacity on Thursday, which is equivalent to rejecting the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the draft law came within the so-called socialist "gift" (a meeting initiated by a single member club) and contained a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the PS presidency, including an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the renewal of fluctuating TIPs, transport check or rent regulation.
Given that the UMP and the NC voted against the discussions of the individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the session was closed after a general debate which had become an opportunity for exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television presentation on purchasing capacity.
The Head of MPs Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of additions to the amendment of the Finance Act to be discussed by the House next week.
The New Festival Is Born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is establishing a new festival, this promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey reported in collaboration with the British organist Melvin Benn Festival.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a man who without a stake inspired the contemporary festival movement in America," revealed Charlie Jones from the Billboard.com server C3.
C3 produces a Chicago festival of Lollapaloosis and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is the summer destination of campers.
The Festival should take place from 8 to 10 August at a private farm with a spread of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the festival Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989 he took over the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, also has the production, license and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benna are working together to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I used to work with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current management of the city, we have become a party to politics, Charlie Jones adds.
" Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben, and we are about to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will eventually serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 resurrected the Lollapaloosis festival in the Chicago Grant Park, after they excelled in the festival scene by the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 made $9,8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of the Melvin Benn festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place rather in the green spaces in the cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way in order to create both the impression of the rural festival after European and urban after American."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland now, including the mayor, is enthusiastic about the event," says Charlie Jones.
The last person appointed refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, however, claims that "they are advantageous enough to allow them to invest in such an event and to welcome the festival that will have, hopefully, a long duration".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will take up 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed at the moment that the programme is only put to the press.
"Vineland will have a rocking breath, but music will be sharp, so that as far as possible we attract a wide range of audiences," says Carlie Jones.
C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promoter award in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it...
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall to Governor's claws?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those they consider to be the best," he said.
Condemnation for festivals
For the moment, however, Denise Turcottea's priority is the promotion of the local film.
It's the Oscars' honor already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether it's festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about presenting Québé films, to alert them and to ensure that directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had a good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be introduced to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th edition of the Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month Quebec also presented four short film and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon exchange at the end of the year? Experts split the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors already have my hands on the expectation that there will be a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
But this year, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif Banka believes that "from a statistical point of view, December has a positive course on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to create forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current contexts, markets are, at least in the short term, certain doubts".
These experts do not assume that the storm is on the move in recent weeks and state that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest in view of the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the strong acceptance of the affected effect of the return on quality securities, both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the storm will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "primarily because there is no known impact of the likely fall in Federal Reserve rates, given the high oil prices and the risk of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that the right moment is not for a bold statement that there will be a marathon.
"There are not too many reasons for joy," this expert assures us.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on 8 November, when the index closed on 15 945.7 points.
Still, all experts don't have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst for Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end up slightly closer to 16,000 points a year by repurchasing portfolios and traditional contributions to pension facilities that occur every year at that time.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be slightly different this year, as he believes that the marathon will occur earlier, in the second December week after the extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The said analyst does not consider that volatility would affect market direction.
Federico Olucha, analyst Inversions Banco, at the same time estimates that we are approaching the technical level and that "for this reason we could observe the reflection of the index generated by the US reports on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst believes these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles that will make sure to bring Ibex to the new maximum terms.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "the year is in a row on strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Oluch of Inversions Banco, on the other hand, assures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and industry.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it occurs.
"ACS has been in position for several months again and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," the expert explains.
The cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas season.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also do very well, even though it is not too well represented on the Spanish market on this field.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, December was only in two cases a month of failure.
The real marathon was held at the end of 2003, in the correct year of the stock market ending the crisis caused by the crackdown on the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
We will see whether 2007 will be in line with the fifth profit year (now Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether he will succeed in having his marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular has decided to upgrade most of its branches.
A total of two hundred located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under Popular Max are a big change for the bank.
As well as for other Spanish entities, it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and bet on an uninterrupted opening time of its branches until 8.30 p.m. and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 p.m.
BBVA, another group, which has also several times ensured that it wants to extend the opening time of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to cancel the opening of 75 % of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening time by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience from Popular will be crucial for other entities to be involved in this initiative, which supports the opening times of trade, or not.
That's exactly what Popular's goal was.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, tradesmen and shops from selected streets, where the branch will open.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain for about 18 months, because it is not about opening new branches, but only about adapting existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will upgrade the branches that it already has in the business zones by adjusting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
This extension of the opening times is complemented by another concept of branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colours.
Ángel Rivera’s business manager assures that this restructuring will not constitute a major investment, but a larger recruitment of staff as it moves from six employees to eight to nine.
Branches will even be equipped with spaces for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Bank Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in Madrid streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and River appears to have been a happy choice.
Bank Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specializing in immigrants, which are operated under the brand Mundocredit, also has a very long opening time and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients', says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telefónica on the sale of mobile phones via external personnel.
Telecinco doubled the value of her Antony 3 rival for the first time on the stock exchange.
We did it.
This sentence was expressed yesterday by Paolo Vasile, Executive President Telecinco, in his satisfaction with the conclusion of the deal, when he found that the television he was operating had doubled the value of her rival Antony 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'what I'm sorry is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we've dropped less,' he said.
And he pointed out that because of the weak market, 'we've dropped less'.
Telecinco closed the deal by 2.54% yesterday.
This profit increased their loss over the past part of the year to 15,66 %.
The stock exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) for Vocent (other 13%) is EUR 4488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Her competitor, Antena 3, which dropped by 1,52 % yesterday and dropped by 40.5% overall since January, has a half-value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been assessed is 3.571 billion for Sogecable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (Cinco Dias publisher) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasili, the comparison with Antony 3 offers because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we will evaluate it in the follow-up.'
Telecinco last week announced that this year is counting on over a billion gross advertising revenues to become the first television channel to secure Giuseppe Tringali, executive president of Telecinco and Publiespaña, branches that provide the group's advertising.
If the estimated data were actually achieved, this television channel would have seen an increase in advertising turnover by 3.6% this year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, Antony's net turnover increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while net revenue from this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay out, which it has retained so far: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, splits 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even if it is early for decision-making, this coefficient could change after buying 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already increased the value of 33% of Endelu'.
According to analysts, the market in these moments shows some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates for Telecinco, 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected income growth from 0.5% to 8,4% in 2008 and 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009 has stopped.
The same company reduced the projected profit of Antony 3, i.e. 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approved the transfer of MiFID valid since 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations which were concluded today by the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated by the Senate in the draft law, the government submitted to the public hearing of the regulation developing the new law with a view to the entry into force of the two before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties have consistently raised the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the bodies necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, foresees the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and supports cooperation between individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will allow financial advice services to be provided to both specialised companies and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services (ESIs), financial consultancy companies (AFIs) that are associated with securities companies, brokerage offices with securities and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for operations with financial instruments is expanding by joining regulated secondary markets with multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems of orders that will compete with current stockbrokers.
The law also obliges investment service providers to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their trade profile, exposure to risk and how to compensate for risk, and requires a statement of all operations carried out to simplify surveillance by the CNMV.
During the negotiations in the Congress Trade Committee, several adjustments were included, including those that included the recognition of securitised claims as a "complex" financial instrument in view of the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the USA with high risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legalize the functions that baccalaers in the economics and management of the enterprise 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for the economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an external intermediary, will not require authorisation from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and customer acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1 % in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using different statistical modelling methods for estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final data which will come into contact on 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to be maintained at relatively high levels"
The second Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes stated that November's ISC increase to 4.1% was "temporary number", but also predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in Congress's machineries has specified that "although it is not a favorable number", the Spanish inflation differential against the monetary union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that the November "was less surprising" than the previous month when the government did not count with such a high increase.
"We were expecting a value of around 4%," said the Minister of Economy at the present date.
Virginia plans to make 42 billion Euros in three years with Northern Rock
Since Northern Rock was in crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from Bank of England, its deposits fell by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At that time, the Bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually declined within two and a half months of client mistrust even though the government offered a flat-rate guarantee for the money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virginia, which will replace its business name with Virgin Money, needs to get around a quarter of the revenues invested in the British banks in the next three years to earn the remaining 18 billion pounds and thus reach the 30 billion target.
Richard Branson's magnate group, known in the United Kingdom for its impressive advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about EUR 70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to reach its goal.
The Northern Rock Bank this week marked a proposal by the Virginia consortium, which consists of three other companies, such as the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totany arrested for alleged corrupt practices during construction
Today, in early morning, the civilian guard detained the current mayor of the Murcia town of Totana (from the People's Party) for his alleged involvement in corrupt practices in the construction that had been discovered this week.
Next up, one of the council secretarys and the local police chief was arrested.
José Martínez Andrea replaced Juan Morales, a contemporary human MP and until then the mayor of the village, who, according to the investigative sources of Cadena SER's television, could be the head of the entire business.
Police officers continue to monitor the building of the town hall and the building commission and no further arrests are excluded in the coming hours.
In addition, lawyer Juan Morales, chief suspect in corrupt practices, was charged with the construction that was discovered earlier this week.
As Cadena SER informed yesterday, a human rights lawyer named Juan Morales, who was examined, arrested on his departure from Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the investigation sources, the subject of the investigation of Morales is the alleged commission selection for his signature of an agreement with a Galician construction company retraining 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer by the State headed by the Toledo PSOE candidate and, if they win, chair the Congress
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatera to stand in the upcoming general elections at the head of the PSOE (Spaniel Workers' Socialist Party) candidacy in Toledo and, if the Socialists win the general election, he became President of the Congress.
So, at the press conference, the PSOE secretary for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself announced, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief of the executive offer to the former minister was justified by the fact that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this policy from La Manchy will be the Socialist Party's candidate for the President of Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono, President of Congress, would replace Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November his decision not to run in the next general elections and to abandon his active political career in order to combat climate change within the framework of university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister had constantly urged him to return to the supreme policy he had left two years ago.
He added that, as well as citizens know who will be the deputy minister of the economy if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who would chair the Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes to transform the House into a "house of respect and not a sigh or screaming" and achieves "more and more like the citizens".
"Unfortunately, sometimes the only place in Madrid where there is no peace and peace to speak is Congress, the Senate Prime Minister was interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
He also spoke praiseworthy words to the address of current President Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place so far, so that he would not be reduced to what his opponents might consider to be "the greatness".
Climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subject to ruthless persecution, both those who view its predictions sceptically and those who prefer other political and social struggles must demonstrate firm coherence.
In addition, to have a leader of a movement who is Prime Minister as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why his Government’s activities or inactions have contributed significantly to Spain’s failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this happens and why its government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it makes him want to explain to the Spanish as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by the habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But that's the kind of explanation we didn't expect, we wouldn't even wait.
Just because you have to sacrifice yourself and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the gasoline price proposed by the PSOE (Spannel Workers' Socialist Party) seemed to Zapater to be so risky from the point of view of the elections that he rushed to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so it doesn't cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by the covenant with the planet, this lord is so useful for the election campaign which he does not speak, accuses, demands nothing, but is the ornament of the parties, and encourages him.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contracting party and does not want us to ride a bike and cool off with a fan.
Mayor and chief of local Totany police detained for suspected corrupt practices during construction
According to the sources of investigation, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "humans" of José Martínez Andrea, the chief of local police, the secretary of the town hall and one of the businessmen in the hospice, for suspicion of committing crimes during the construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to a town hall, where he is now located with a number of police officers who have also joined the Commission for Construction and the City Company for Industrial Property and Housing.
These three arrests came to the sixth, which took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during an operation related to the retraining of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the ground suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying unlawful commissions during the last election period, could build 4,000 homes there.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but are accused of short-term proceedings before the court of the first instance of Totana.
Six of the first arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totany is investigated and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament behind the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
Next, his ex-wife, the owner of the real estate office, was charged, registered today in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of Nuaria Group, lawyer and entrepreneur from Viga, was arrested in Niger (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., Director of Suelo de Inmonuar, who belongs to that group and through which bribes were paid.
The investigation is carried out by the Civil Guard Operations Central Unit, whose members besides the arrest, also carried out 11 surveys, mostly in companies related to the arrested, with headquarters in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedre, Las Rozas (Madrid Province) and Totany.
At the time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, in the area of the very well-known owner of the company for poultry meat products, which could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria group was entrusted with the status of the largest residential complex in the town of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land reclassified in Totana, and its project was intended to double the settlement of the village with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonaar, which support the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Corunia, Venezuela and Fernando el Catalico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of construction elements.
That's what happens.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's issue of the most important Finnish newspapers Helsingin Sanomat (by the beginning of the PISA programme on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18th, the same day the critics of Blackburn's book appeared there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at a school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his notes the work of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a school councillor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the news pages of Helsingin Sanomat that the professors take a critical view of Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools."

One colleague shall inform of the introduction of the criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. The download of one song would be a crime at a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you cut the board at a price below 400 euros, it is considered a mere offense (§ 623.1).
B. If you alienate up to EUR 1 000, stealing is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less important to participate in fighting than changes in compacts.
Participation in the event of an imbalance has a rate of between three months and one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and a rate of exchange of compacts would be between six months and two years.
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered as less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading the film on DVD.
F. Non-authorised distribution of copyright-protected films is more punishable than the provision of juvenile pornographic materials (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, someone's hand has been taken seriously.

My doctor is pushing one of his articles on strange research entitled "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feeling that causes monthly salaries for employees depends on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonances on the tomography and results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the head of the group, the Negroognica display of the Institute Life&Brain in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the participant in the research reacted correctly and his colleague misinterpreted."
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has had eight years of relentless persecution from the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague of a criminal from the Balkan War.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will go away with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladič and former leader of Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadžič, are still at large.
Their names are listed, from which the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, not listed in Spain), followed by the pace of the detective thriller from Belgrade to New York by the work of the Swiss prosecutor in persecuting the fugitive criminals and the pressure on the countries concerned to tighten the network.
What insurance is suitable for me?
The insurance of a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident is a significant expenditure which depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
The choice of suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we're talking about.
Insurance of the vehicle is an agreement between the insurance undertaking and the insurance undertaking.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed insurance amount at a certain amount for taking over the damage to the insurance undertaking in the event of an accident.
Insurance is the price of insurance which is determined by reference to various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driver's licence, type of vehicle insured or its use etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely the accident occurs, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons aged 25 and women must pay lower insurance premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies concluded that persons living in marriage had fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the journey, and the likelihood of an accident.
The increase in frequency of driving increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurers consider when determining the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must study well the situation in order to choose such insurance as is best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variable for the choice of the type of insurance, which, in addition to complying with the type of insurer, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 are faced with various disadvantages such as little driving experience and short driving licence holding when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although the ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are even cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all insurance risks with a discount in order to obtain insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would provide for the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"Part of the remuneration of the insurance event provided by the client will be determined in advance in determining the insurance price which will be higher than the level of participation," explains Luis Noguera, Chief of First Europe in Spain, Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other operators by ensuring that the client is insured against damage caused to other persons, but not against the damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A recommendation.
If you're under twenty-five years old, try to be careful and prevent accidents as far as possible, because it will affect your bonus and make it possible to reduce future insurance.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the contrary, the small amount is the increase in the mentioned base rate.
"The bonus and the small will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to raise the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the limit of twenty-five years, it makes it easier for drivers to negotiate insurance because the customer risk index is decreasing, thanks to experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to negotiate insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people usually cannot draw on the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident and even in the course of the proceedings," he assures the director of the European company in Spain and adds that most accidents occur in the second year of the proceedings, when he has already been overcome by "the fear of a rookie".
However, if the client is married, but does not yet have children, it is better to arrange for insurance against all risks if, however, his economic situation permits.
Families with children are considered to be the lowest risk index clientele and therefore their accruals will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a premium (which could be EUR 300) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting at the third year of purchase of the vehicle.
"their management is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford to get the highest discount," said Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended to insurance against all risks with a premium discount (which is EUR 150) or insurance extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents considerable expenditure, which is a good reason for properly examining the insurance options that would suit us most in terms of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get the AC Milan point, which means the osmificial.
AC Milan and Celtic will temper their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to get a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, as it would be the first for Italy and for Scotland it would decide to place.
The Italians have ten points and have already taken steps in the fifth fight of the draw in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but he needs another one to make sure he doesn't get to Šachtjor with six points, which will play with the Benfika, which has four.
These two games of group D will be played a week before the sixth round ends, because AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the thirteenth in the semifinal first time, in an effort to join the 16th final.
So this group will be closed before the others, and the indecisive result at Giuseppe Meazzo Stadium seems most likely, even if both men try to seek victory because the Italians won't want to tact on domestic soil and Celtic knows that after winning would be the first and would secure a better place in the eight-finals.
Gordon Strachan's man could have suffered a loss even if he did not win, but couldn't count on it because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow (2:1) last week, but won in the first direct match (2:0).
And so AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening to the Scottish people who believe that the second time they will get to the semifinals in the reorganised Champions League just as they beat them in the same game in the last goal competition with the Kaka in the extension (1:0) after status 0:0 in the basic time of the game.
Hoping to win the "rossoneri" will be Šachtjor, for whom it is worth winning, only if Celtic loses, both for progress to the 8-final and for staying in the UEFA.
Benfica, while last and unable to continue in the highest European competition, could win a third place, so she would play in UEFA.
The first performance of the Spice Girls tournament took place in Vancouver 20 000 people
The Spice Girls Group started its first tour in Vancouver, Canada, before 20,000 viewers began their first tour since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, declared that the reconnection of their group is "great".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets to attend a concert, which also included a video covering the history of this group, which caused a sensation in the late 1990 ’ s.
The return and world tours take place at the same time as the new album is released by the EMI in Spain, which brings a selection of their main success stories, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the stage decorated bracelets presented to them by the husband "Posh Spice", British football player David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said about a British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks of the show."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the conflicts between us" two years later the dissolution of a five-member group, also revealed her nervousness when she met with journalists two hours before the beginning of the performance.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw the world's public opinion changed, the opinion of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made my decision," Chishol said of the group's reunification, which she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "the things have settled and we all love each other very much."
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls last joined together in 1998.
At the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver by special Virgin Airlines.
On arrival, an army of babysitters was expecting them at the airport.
Five has a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
He'll perform in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over the new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine about the price of natural gas, thus increasing the risk that Russian deliveries of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is driven by pipeline through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas to Ukraine, Russia will be charged higher transit charges.
The previous dispute between the two last year has reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state owned a gas monopoly, Gazprom, is trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its gasprom deliveries.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," said Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatolij Kinach to Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments concerning the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The latest major dispute between Moscow and Kiev has reduced the supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a crushing decline in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The controller said that the Scottish chambers of NHS must improve the control of criminal registers for non-European employees.
The recommendation from the President of the Supreme Audit Office of Robert Black came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland had been involved in the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also afraid that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign personnel he employs.
But his report pointed out that the other key checks were carried out in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in obtaining personnel from countries outside the European Economic Area immediately following the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired Jeep at the door of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who showed up at the Central Criminal Court with a video bridge accused of connection to attempted bombings in the United Kingdom.
NHS chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland to control criminal registers, it has no authority to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, in addition to other recommendations, that the Commission should be allowed to follow the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which assist employers with controls in several countries.
"While we found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they were not carried out regularly," the report said.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS is in many ways consistent with its own pre-employees policy, but he added: "Our report draws attention to areas in which the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information on the number of foreign personnel."
BMA Chairman Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report indicates that current pre-employment controls in Scotland NHS are working well and it is not clear what further value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably be higher also because the Commission had a problem identifying staff with residence permits.
The survey also found that the established control procedures for NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Gramian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently recasting the policy and the Pre-Employment Control Directive for Foreign Workers of the NHS.
Minister of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to do this job immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish Government, in line with the health commissions, would consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that the best practices appear in the updated Pre-Employment Control Directives of all personnel - including foreign personnel - which she plans to publish next month.
Joy Division controlled the film prices.
Control, a novel film about the late singer Joy Division Ianu Curtis, collected five prices at British Independent Film Awards, including the best film award.
The prizes were also awarded by the star Sam Riley, who, up to the role of Curtis, worked in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and Toby Kebell.
Lady Judy Dench was named the best actress for the thriller Note about the scandal.
And Daniel Craig's brandy star won Variety's award for getting a British movie on the world scene.
The prizes were delivered at the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' path to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost only 3 million pounds.
But he got Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic packaging of the album U2 Joshua Tree, two prices - for best director and best debuting director.
Rock music was a focus of another award - because Juliena Temple's film about singer Clash Joe Strummer won the prize for the best document.
Viggo Mortensen won a cookie for the best actor as a driver of the Russian Mafia boss in London's David Cronenberg thriller.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation built on the roles of tough guys, won the Richard Harris award for his extraordinary contribution to the British film.
This 50 - year - old man, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming another part of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of crystal skulls.
Winston said he was proud of this award, which is named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Bify, are awarded by the jury, in which filmmakers, actors and festival organizers sit.
Among the advocates and patrons of Bif are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Evan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil equipment as well as on spiritual and security components.
The state television of the biggest oil exporter said that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
The al-Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, United States allies since 2003, from invasion to Iraq.
The TV report announced that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner planned to attack an oil company in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid reaction force unit of 35,000 defence personnel from the failed attack by al-Qaida on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by an "expert on missile launch" which slipped into the country.
She further stated that the militants planned to smuggle eight shots into the kingdom.
Twenty-two detainees were to prepare for the murders of spiritual and security personnel.
The government urged the clergy to try harder to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join the al-Qaida militants fighting the Allied forces and the Shiite government supported by the US, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider to be heretic.
Al-Qaida militants believe that many clergymen in Saudi Arabia have been recruited by the authorities to support the royal family that governs the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of al-Qaeda leader Sauda Osama bin Ladina to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a tremendous effort by the security forces in the past... five months," said the state television to the interior spokesman of the Ministry.
The 16-member "Media Cell" in Medina was also arrested, which was intended to promote "Takfiri thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims marked as non-believers and apostates.
Also among the arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
Climate in Venus may be a view to the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once be a pleasant place to live.
Data from the surrounding European stations show that the planet is even more similar to the prodigal twin Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and are circling along similar paths, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago on Venus conditions were similar to those on Earth and could have been inhabited.
But the flattened greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower speed of rotation sent Venus on a completely different development path.
Today, a planet without water, the temperature on the surface is quite hot for the melting of lead, and the storm and the winds of the hurricane are raging.
The findings of the Venus Express European Space Agency probe, which studied the planet for one year, offer a clear view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Oxford University Physics Department and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission said, "It's getting clearer why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to come up with a scenario in which Venus started the same way as the Earth, perhaps with a population environment, billions of years ago."
Police have retained "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was detained yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were detained and the material was examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000).
Still spiced
Mitt Romney said that for presidential candidates, it is not worthy to answer the snowman's questions.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed to a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them over to the candidates for dispatch.
None of the issues raised on Wednesday 28 November were as comical as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate of the other party on YouTube.
But the questions and the answers this time also reflected many of the Republican side's state of affairs in the next year's elections.
It is not clear how CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose the videos that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the strongest topics in the Republic.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn around when they heard something comforting: the speaker noted the summits of approval when the candidates talked about a strong approach at the border.
The strongest and longest exchange of views occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who pushed forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, as the prime minister of New York, was soft on an illegal immigrant.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of the state of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two fought particularly violently when they asked whether any of the candidates would support an "amnestii" (give illegal immigrants normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Other candidates like Duncan Hunter, California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, were able to throw their little mill into the mill on this subject.
None of these two have a chance of a nomination, but they both stay in the game for perhaps starting to beat up the alarm because of immigration sooner and harder than the others.
At least for immigration, the candidates have roughly the same opinion: a greater presence at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with the concerns of food toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps the republics to forget or minimize the conflict between the liberines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to get very uncomfortable when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the holding of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the technique of simulated heating should be considered torture.
One of the divers asked if the candidates believed each word in the Bible.
Through it, Mr. Giuliani concluded that although the Bible is his favorite book, it does not believe in literally the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another teacher asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckbee, who is now at the forefront of recent research in Iowa because of his long-term Christian Conservatism, said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, Jesus said that he was too clever to run, thus earning the laugh.
The match remains unusually open.
The growth of Mr. Huckbee in Iowa is covered with recent successes in raising money and a loud joy to Ron Paul during the Wednesday debate.
These two have strayed from the bottom because both wings of the sides are still unable to agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with a winning report on the American size on the lips, snooping on both sides.
This time the side is divided and the result has far to be unambiguous.
Labourists Pains
Gordon Brown once again found a trap to which he might fall; his way out remains the same.
Although it is common for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
It does not appear that some orders would be sold, no accounts at the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extra-marriage fingers have been recovered.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have done without the discovery that some wealthy businessman masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party of 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million) under the names of other people for four years and that the party did not declare it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided the election and insulted the British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by the survey, there was hope that it would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead of making it more and more funny as the vice-president of the Liberal Democrats, once the feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock's problem bank showed a weakness in management and a poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to change the tax code brought companies together against the government.
Loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative misdemeanours.
The three generals of retirement began a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested the massacres in military spending because they claimed that being the commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary - general of the labyrinthists (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is going unrelentingly toward his end.
Even so, governments can reach the turning point they find difficult governments.
People don't trust politicians, and they don't like them, but they usually push back their distrust when they take over the new team.
Once it seems clear that some prime minister probably won't improve anything, and even don't have to be in the office for long, this is getting away: the state administration is becoming a hole, the ministers are starting to make briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly complicated, as it cannot take on the position of a new broom against other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and financial records are linked to decisions Mr Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in blair's troubles, such as a long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "values for money", voters may well judge that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they look.
They're not as horrifying as conservatives do.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one died or was totally deceived.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's stalistic tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and easy-to-be brutal government.
The latest stir around political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity, says that he did not wish for his charity any publicity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams' procedure, but did not know that he was illegal, would certainly be thoroughly interrogated; as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labour Seeker of Money, who learned about the indignant gifts in October.
But so far, Mr Brown has nothing to do with it; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these conundrums, even though the main part of the payments was made after his arrival in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned this violation by his own party, but dismissed his decision by reaching after a proven instrument, a committee to examine the matter - followed by an additional bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lesson is not complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are also other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been without one for six months, and moving forward with a genuine reform of the funding of political parties.
This would require Labourers who are in close contact to cooperate with conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with trade unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party, such as Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back the voters; and the only way to win is to unthinkable integrity and high competence.
Card shark
Does the crisis of inferior mortgages affect the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, naturally, there's a lot of excitement in the spinal cord.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is stalled, predators have focused on the market for credit cards.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that losses on credit cards, if other consumer credit variants were to be transferred from inferior mortgages, could have reached $99 billion.
The voltage signs are obvious.
The number of inability to pay (at more than 30 days late) and written-off accounts (accounts considered by the provider to be impermissible) is increasing.
Last month, HSBC announced that US consumer credit market lost $1.4 billion - also due to non-solvent credit card loans.
But it's too soon to panic.
The accounts written off and the inability to pay is still low.
According to the Moody's evaluation agency, the rate of insolvency in the third quarter was 3.89% by almost the whole percentage point below the average.
The worsening rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the US personal bankruptcy laws of 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcys, which make a large part of the losses on credit cards; therefore, the number of reports (including the number of write-offs) would rise regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good level of compliance, which shows how many consumers will pay their debts monthly.
And the trust in securities of secured credit cards is firm, despite paralysis in other aspects of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research firm predicts that their 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct pathways to spread infection between the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: if loans for real estate are drained, consumers will rather be indebted over credit cards.
However, issuers of credit cards look at cash flows rather than the value of handheld items, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They may even be advantageous to the lenders.
Motivation of consumers to pay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets drops below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up on the list of priorities to repay.
Credit issuers can also respond more quickly and more flexibly to more stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid change in the price of handicrafts.
"It's not going to happen that one beautiful morning we're just rethinking all the loans," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosion in the style of inferior mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card sector will stand before a darker future.
Watch out for the back fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron's case
The three British bankers who were to be judged for their role in the fraud associated with the former financial manager of Enron Andrew Fastow have changed their statement and pleaded guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally guilty of seven fraud charges, when they were to take part in financial fraud together with Fastow in 2000 -- to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers -- to deny it.
They were supposed to stand in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former Greenwich NatWest employees, units of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, appeared on the front page for two years, which took place in the publishing process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the Enron-launched investigation in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 warned Mr Fastov that it was the aim of the government investigation on Enron's collapse.
The prosecution against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to set up a fraud with Fastow and his former chief associate Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner office, controlled by Fastow, which was an architect of a lot of enron scams, which tainted Enron after a spiral towards bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share of this branch as zero, but our three British knew that it was indeed of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought a share of the bank in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for his share of the company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars for its share of Greenwich NatWest.
But those 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers were charged with 7.3 million, and Fastow, Kopper, and others got about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two cases to conspiracy for his role in the breakdown of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in prison for three years and one month in a facility in Texas.
All three of the British were moving on bail for $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the coming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks were no longer able to hide billions of debts or show failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse canceled thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former head of staff Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their part in the fall of the company.
Skilling has been performing more than twenty-four years of punishment.
The sentences on Lay for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow Non-Safety
The price of the Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel volume for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, begins at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, of course, it's tiny for a return.
"Can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But none of them have that much interest, because it's for the sake of a family or corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat in the stand of the Gulfstream last Friday at the Millionaire Show, which is a four-day orgy of a showy consumer in the mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers hoped that the freshly wealthy Russians would lure everything from a mahogany-loaded yachts to diamonds decorated partitions into cars for which even 50 Cents would not be ashamed.
Mr. Firer carefully looked after the bright orange Porsche at the side stand.
"That's a nice car, but it's all about pennies and dimes," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Oil waves play in the Russian capital just as much as Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans were extremely rich and dragged to Europe where they were viewed as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, listener of the fourth year at the Davis Center of Russian and Euro-Asian Studies at Harvard.
Like Saudi fighters from the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the most prominent world spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their piece on this Klondike.
In another place in Moscow, Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH Group, came here this week to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods on markets such as the Russian one.
(The Conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has a list of the richest people in the Forbes magazine of 53 billionaires with a total worth of $282 billion.
In addition, the local institute of Center for Economic and Financial Research has issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which in Russia there are 103,000 "second-class" millionaires whose assets total $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that 15.8% of the Russians lived below the existential minimum in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, London jewel sales and marketing representative David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly adjusted, and men are each for the whole fortune."
When walking in evening dresses on Sunday evening halami, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatovová and five years older Svetlana Turovová and their clients described themselves as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who leaned into branded clothes like a veteran of red carpets, next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a domestic duck.
The fair seemed to focus primarily on fresh treasurers, brand-controlled Russian buyers, who are willing to sit for several hours in traffic to pass through the warehouses, which scribbles Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fishes, Mövenpick ice cream, bowling tables at peace, apartments in Dubai, flashy Gund and spring.
Members of the public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch producer of Royal Delft before the reproduction of Rembrandt's painting of hand-painted blue tiles in excess of life size.
"Absolutely interested in the Russians more gold."
And indeed, here the sellers say that the Russians with old money (according to the Russian scales is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from the flash logs to the few familiar signs of limited editions that would never appear on the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether the millionaires, the ambassadors of the millionaires or the simplest tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil’s bed sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold thread, at $70,000.
So on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, who supplies high-end high-end vehicles with high-end alarms, said that his company sold clearly orange Porsche for $170,000 to Russian millionaires.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, who is willing to adjust luxury cars, sold three bars to cars in the style of tied chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantomy for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a wheel of a car designed for the Russian casino owner, which had an extract of the Swarov crystal covered so that it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"That Russian millionaire, who wants his women's pelts of skin or portrait of a cube zirconium, doesn't have to ride on those wheels yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage by 30 or 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Carapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently does not mean much exclusive, given the high price rise of the properties here.
"If you bought a flat in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand run by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company set up four red British-style telephone booths with a million dollars worth of counterfeit bills.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, said his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaires Fair.
The neighbors stopped by to throw around piles of money, or to let their friends take a picture of their mobile phone, as they were resting in the middle of a substitute wealth, or they just poured out a few million.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may have been caused by a corrupt operation.
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of this restaurant about something healthier and watched the ambulance that came to the white New England house by two houses down West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car soon joined.
And then another one.
"So I saw the delivery of the medical examiner come," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant controller.
"At that moment, I knew that someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant director of the New York Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide who worked in house 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicology tests, whose results may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that led the Newar police to send a wave of sadness.
Ms. Arroy was the assistant police director, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known by many to the department.
"She was loyal, tough and hard-working," Mr. McCarthy said about Miss Arroy in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"It was my shield.
She would have protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Miss Arroy was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former non-war police officer who works for the Commission for the Control of Alcoholic Drinks, leaving two sons behind at the age of 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the Union district, Theodore J. Romankova, said the detectives were trying to find out if Miss Arroy died of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still under way."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about three o'clock in the afternoon.
November, and they found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if Ms. Castro's office had been interviewed.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, with a broken rose bush in front of the garden and a dalmatine barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the cellar, he was rubbing a blue barrel in an open garage with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain wheels hanging on the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in the New York Police Department 25 years later, Miss Arroy gave him invaluable help in experimenting with the hateful and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful about this or this," said she.
"She was always here when I got here, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the Fed will reduce interest rates leads to a stronger world stock exchange
The stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after hopes of the market that the Federal Bank would try to calm the lending conditions by further reducing interest rates, were strengthened by calming statements by the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
The storms jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in line with Ben Bernank, President of the Fed, said that in response to continuing pressure on the financial markets, the managers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
As part of a clear attempt to calm the upheaval markets in the middle of the signs of a resilient credit effort, Mr. Kohn said that recent upheavals "have partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets by the end of September and October".
He added that if the increased instability persists, it will increase the possibility that the financial conditions of households and companies will deteriorate further.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is ready to add additional fresh capital levies to the US markets and possibly further reductions in interest rates to stabilise the credit conditions.
These comments also helped to calm Wall Street in the midst of other bad news about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed record low numbers.
The consequences of the financial winding-up were undermined by the announcement by the Investment Bank of Bear Stearns that it would cancel 650 jobs, which are 4% of its global workforce, in the context of cost reductions due to the compensation of the heavy losses caused by the unspecified rate of granting subordinated housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these sites are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13,289,40, while the more used S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6 306.2, with the value of British blue-chips increasing by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets appeared to be in full force after the European Central Bank's three-month monetary package auction loaned these funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, which is the largest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release over-standard money on London's cash markets has increased by increasing the rate of three-month British interbank loans "Libor" after continuous growth from 12 November to its maximum from the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's gonna be number six on the baton for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in the broader context, nothing less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the selection committee, who holds to the best of his post in the borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help, and because Hugh Morris's table, chief manager of the English team, begins to apply to the national selector, not necessarily to be fully engaged.
The one who will not be built in the sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets at the top of his profession, while someone else will never get across a lower level, sometimes due to lack of happiness rather than ability.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult and requires an assessment which must ultimately always be subjective.
Is the time right for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if you do?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young leaders with good education and insight in the field, they should be promoted to the Commission - the place is only for one.
Who's to say what level is right for a cricket when he can't get down or swim to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a big influence on decision making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must get the Captain's look at the right moment, if he should take the Wicket, and the bat needs regular chances at the starting positions, if he should ever impress as a day-old cricketer.
It's more complicated to get a sampler's view.
For example, last season was much better than James Anderson, whose place in the first test seemed certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artillery.
Anderson took 32 Wickets in the first class at 33 passes for each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on an equally modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hoped for others.
If he's gonna play at Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can lead or finish both careers, or it may not have a big impact.
Four years ago, at Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and in the first class performed well, five Wickets and 40 free runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable test critic, who is also, although in Australia against Australia, recorded two hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion in relation to today's training at the stadium of Asiggiya, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience over Bopar's youthful vigor.
There are arguments for both of us.
For Shah he speaks his sparkly and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class compared to the six Bopars, who is, in twenty-two years, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin arches.
However, Shah made two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test of Lord's, his home field in Middlesex, just ten runs, and this, along with the immediate refusal of pickers, when Vaughan tried to re-set him on another match, his firing seemed to take something from the elan that was so evident in Mumbai.
On the other hand, the Essex University has a joie de vivre in its bones.
On the cricket field, nothing cures him and his behavior outside the playground symbolizes a recently turned car with four wheels on the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He took out minor injuries and possibly shock, but first of all, he pulled out his Vodafone (also sponsored), and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who was watching it in the distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-fast loop arches on the players here, which seems to suit him, distributes effectively and fires confidently and skillfully.
Picking the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I tend to get Bopar his chance now, which I don't want to say is that Shah won't excel if, as the Cilon tea leaves indicate, he's the one who's gonna play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday and to drop off the fugitives who had lost the money or visa period, and others who had hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some have even returned to fight the armed men who expelled them from their homes.
The Mansour Bus Station was before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaissi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the paper about what happened in Baghdad and how safe he is now.
"They say the Mahdi army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shia militia of the militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, an eight-year-old Shiite teacher from the mostly Sunni region of Amarija, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visas and because the regime did not allow the Iraqis to work there.
His Shiite neighbors in Amarija called him with the help of the American army to push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was banished from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"The communicator called me a few friends and told me that he was going to Sleikh to the militia against al-Qaeda and that he needed me and my boys' support.
That's why I came back today," said 20-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many talked about the attractiveness of calm in the capital after strengthening the American military presence and the growth of local "group of captured citizens" who defend their quarter by the American army.
But more was said about the return of more than 1.3 million Iraqis who had fled to Damascus to be surrounded by visas and money loss.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 1-year-old father of three children, voiced the suspicion shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian Government to impose restrictions on the visas of refugees and had them return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving the Iraqis a visa to have to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned me after I left the house."
The fact that Sunni were pushed out of Shia and vice versa is a partial reason for the deterioration of violence, which in many places reduces tension.
Fears arise that the sudden influx of refugees again reawakens sectarian tensions and leads to further fighting.
Small Sarah, good education
Germany's smallest social country plays a leading role in vocational education, and even excels at the international focus of its universities.
In one educational area alone, Sarah is concerned about the same lack as the rest of Germany.
"The man who does not come from Sarajevo, I explained yesterday after 50 that we are not French" - this self-ironic password appears on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest common country.
France and Luxembourg, however, play a major role in monitoring the education of the Kolín Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
Thus, colleges traditionally cooperate closely with the surrounding countries.
In 1948, the University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a relatively high proportion of foreign students of 15,6 %.
After all, the average number of Sarai children is admitted to high school - many of them even without high school.
"A professional education system is used in Sarajevo," says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert from IW.
The fact that more than one fifth of the youth is entitled to study at a vocational school is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are plenty of options in Sarajevo to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities of studying two fields are the best in terms of the number of inhabitants of the second in all Germany.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates dropped by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Sarajevo Ministry of Education has now instructed universities to set up a propaganda campaign for engineering.
"After the first study of Pis, we conducted several reforms at general education schools," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore established comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of maternity school is free - a model that takes over other community countries as well.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, they will show up for future comparative studies.
In the implementation of the Pisa study in 2003, the share of risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20 %.
In total, however, Sarah did not improve as much as the rest of the common land.
Bavarians can count better.
And to the disappointment of Sarah's studies, Pis's studies do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, it could be in this area that Sarasko could score.
The language of the neighbors is compulsory in the gymnasium - although the people of Sarajevo are not French.
The mating moves the clocks.
The hours in Venezuela are going to be different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will move the clock in this South American country half an hour back.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chavez becomes a ridiculous figure.
Venezuela's official letter informed that hours under the new law would be less than four and a half hours apart from world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision, inter alia, by forcing the United States to divide time zones over hours.
In the middle of local time, Chávez further announced that he was breaking off relations with neighbouring Colombia because of the bail with hostages.
This leftist nationalist declared that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is President of Colombia, he and the Colombian government will not maintain any relations with him.
"I cannot do it anymore because of my self-esteem," said Chávez, who is promoting the reform of the Constitution, about which citizens of this oil country must vote in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The attack prompted Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with the Marxist rebels to release the hostages.
Uribe, by his decision Venezuela "swimmed into the face", criticized on Sunday the Uribe Chávez.
Everyone's talking about Chávez in Spain, too.
A new mobile call here sparked a stir: "Por qué no te callas" (Why are you no longer silent?) - so is the sentence that has been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
It was spoken by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent high summit of Iberoamerican, loud remarks by this leftist popularist, was so upset that he silenced him in this way.
Germans face lower wages in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages despite strong conjunctivities.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employees can actually count on them getting less pay than last year.
"The wine carries a small increase in salaries, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," said the daily Bild Gustav Horn of the Institute of Research (Institut für Macro-Conomie und Konjunkturforschung).
New staff burdens may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Pierre Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that for the new year the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Labour Agency would no longer be able to fall into such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from the social youth, quoting the newspaper of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and petroleum products had driven inflation to its highest level in the last 13 years.
In the annual comparison, the total price rose by three percent.
Venus is a hell of a twin Earth
During her life, the hostile atmosphere of Venus Earth is more similar than ever anticipated. The European Venus Express Space probe in Venus noted the phenomena that appear on Earth in the winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind belief in fields.
For nearly three decades, scientists have come to realize that Venus is glowing.
The European Venus Express probe has now brought evidence - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning from cloud to cloud at a height of about 56 kilometres, wrote in a scientific magazine of Nature Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory of the origin of the original matter, life could be created on Earth by lightning. The storms reportedly sparked a reaction in the oceans that led to amino acids, the basic stones of life.
This was not the case in Venus: "If there ever was a life there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"The Venus is perhaps a hell of a twin earth, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why did Venus, which is so much like Earth and its size, begin to develop completely differently, is the basic issue of Esa's mission.
Since no probe has been sent exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of Venus Express probe was a milestone in the exploration of this planet in November 2005.
According to scientists, the latest results of research that approached several articles in Nature magazine did not stress the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more similar to Earth than ever anticipated," said Esa.
In addition to the already known winds on the north pole, scientists have found a dark vortex on the southern pole, which is moving much faster.
This phenomenon resembles the air currents of the Earth's Northern Hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guisip Piccioni of the Italian Institute Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second most internal planet of our solar system is almost the same matter as Earth and with an average of 12 100 km is almost as big as it is.
This planet, called the Jitřenka or the Evening Meal, will be held by the Sun for almost 225 days.
However, around its own axis it rotates much slower. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus has a surface temperature of 460 °C and 92 bar Earth does not recall, scientists say that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both sides the water was accumulated, but on Earth it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bonded in carbons, most of the atmosphere is formed on Venus.
Köhler defends the meeting of Merkel with the Dalai Lama
The Federal President, Köhler, demands the closure of the parties' disputes for the adoption of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellor's Office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and calls for a large coalition to end the quarrel around the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves on the outside as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the economic newspapers Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal to me," Köhler said.
While the Federal President stressed that everyone knew that Germany had to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, it did not prevent him from standing up to Merkel when it was calculated that it was creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not let go of the traditional single China policy.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) gave an indirect statement of his disagreement with the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by a coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, to the foreign coalition's "leading" policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellor's Office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Pierre Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL, the so-called strategic dialogue between the ministries also froze the foreign countries.
The Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angel Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept Tibetan spiritual leader, stressed Wen Jiabao’s position in China.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet and other Tibetan areas, which are also located in the territory of China, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar unrest that erupted in France
Street battles with police, shootouts, fire-extinguishing cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar unrest that erupted in France.
We must do everything to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow in violence on the street, calls on the Minister of the Interior.
The barricades burned, the robbers fired shotguns at the police. After serious youth concerns in France, the Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful that we too do not create the kind of social tension that will break out in violence.
We must take it seriously," he said in the Hannover newspaper Neue Press.
Not every young person is said to be able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The common government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to solve problems, Schäuble said.
Which is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration after the conference on Islam, we record the first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble at the same time pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
Youths with police in the northern suburbs of Paris fought hard on the streets in the past nights.
Even in Toulouse, she burned cars and public buildings.
A larger integration effort by the German government was required by the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, he warned the Colat against the "similar effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, action should still be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "extremely high".
Above all, there is a need to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed, "We must give youth hope."
The president of the Turkish municipality, however, added that more social control of families exists in Germany than in France.
In addition, many migrant youths do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
The Colat urged: "But we must be careful."
We have to enable the youth to "be quick to start working and to learn."
Meanwhile, the night remained mostly calm in the Paris suburb of Villars-le- Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with headlamps flew over the area.
The authorities reported three arrests and several fire-extinguishing waste baskets and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 ordered forces have been in charge of peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, after a visit to the suburban minister Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In the riots in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bell, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse was disturbed.
The riots caused a Sunday traffic accident in which two youths lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the State Attorney's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of juveniles.
In Angela's "Bloody"
The Chancellor's realistically remote output documents that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we can no longer expect anything from it.
Which country does this Chancellor live in?
After her uncomfortably, indifferently sounding and contently poor performance at the general debate of the Common Chamber, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should eventually manage.
To the regret that she is focusing too much on foreign policy, Angela Merkel answered once in a very arrogant sentence.
That's the province, she said, which showed that she didn't want to understand what critics were up to.
She clearly demonstrated in the Federal Chamber how much she deserved this regret.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a feeling of trouble in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblaková" presented herself: a politician who excels over others who run into foreign politics and even there only expresses himself vaguely.
For example, climate protection: without ceasing the conclusions of the Heiligendam summit, but no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And at all, such a wave - so much immodestness would have been forgiven by the President of the CDU two years ago.
It is now limited to the planned phrases that could increase her love among people.
This approach damages its image of a pragmatist who does not need to be flattered because it solves problems.
But in Angela's "Obleks" empire, internal political problems are marginal issues.
Child poverty and the worry of people with low wages?
A few side-by-side speeches on these topics were left.
It's worth noting how often the Merkels, when it comes to child additions, they say, "No."
Three times, Merkel has to start from the beginning to be able to say at least a partially correct sentence.
Once things start to be very specific, it's going down like a completely alien area.
Department of Attack
The debate between the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube in the case of the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney has spread in a heated debate - and both must now be afraid of the outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates has already been demonstrated on the first topic.
Mitt Romney's challenge to his opponent, Rudy Guiliani, that he made New York a "preservation facility for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani responds quickly with acute remorse: "I believe his own house was just one such refuge," answers and presupposes former Governor Massachusetts, who privately employed immigrants without documents.
In view of the fact that the Republican base has not yet been clearly favoured, eight presidential candidates use these debates at CNN mainly to discredit their rivals.
Half minute, internet users filmed and via YouTube posted videos serve only as such tips of a key theme.
"This is precisely the policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to seize power," John McCain challenges his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one who is promoting the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain does not spare his regrets or Romney for refusing to condemn the torture method of interrogation called "Waterboarding" in which the heating is simulated.
The public’s reactions in the Florida St. Petersburg show that there is no war in Iraq or torture among the important themes of the campaign.
The audience leaps into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
So it turns out where both favorites' weaknesses lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explained Romney in part, asking the party base and the television audience for forgiveness for being the advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to express himself to a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian history
The day after his resignation from the position of Chief of Staff of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharaf made a presidential oath.
This concludes eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Parviz Musharf, made a presidential oath Thursday and will remain in the presidency for another five years.
Pakistan's television broadcast was a lively ceremony held at the Presidential Palace in the capital city of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to honor the Constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, his office as commander-in-chief of the army handed his confidant to Ashfaq Kyyani, thus subjecting himself to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after the bloodthirsty military coup, the former general ruled for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By withdrawing from the position of Chief of Armed Forces, Musharraf met one of the main requirements of the opposition and of the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional condition that Musharaf declared on November 3rd.
According to Chief Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayum, Musharaf will cancel the emergency situation soon after his oath, thus fulfilling another of the requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the Country, which, following the announcement of an exceptional state at the beginning of November, ruled him out by favored lawyers, over the past week rejected all objections to the disputed re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Vaziristan and four others were injured.
A speaker's army said the bomb exploded on the road near the Afghanistan border.
Fathers of Crautrock Return
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group recaptured their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a haircut from the most successful band period.
They were much better known abroad at the time.
The announced sensation then rests in the performance of three gentlemen who at first look like they're just enjoying their dinner.
Everyone's got a box, cables and buttons in front of them.
Thirty-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
After his left there's a 7-year-old Michael Rother who's got a laptop and a guitar ahead of him.
Thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who concentrates on synthesizers, is from the view of the audience on the right.
Everyone makes noises, sometimes even beats.
Some of them, of course, create traditional compositions.
It doesn't seem to bother the masters of musicians.
Among the Krautrock lovers, the novelty of the band Harmonia caused a considerable stir.
One thing is worth noting here. The repeated questions showed that this name is part of a collective awareness of the bud but it is certainly not enough running so that someone misses this band for twenty-three years.
But why couldn't a German celebrate his still living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when he values music style, mistakenly called Krautrock, in England and America more than in his own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the remaining members of the Can Cologne Group the Echo Award for Life’s Work, the hall was full of questionable views of the German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the La Düsseldorf and Neu groups for their speech, he no longer knew the bounds of the audience.
Michael Rother later sat with them at Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
In memory of the Harmonia band, we unnecessarily overload our memory, this trio existed for only two years, and at that time it had not had the same effect that others later added to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name Cluster.
At first, they played in the cellar of the Berlin theatre Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a gramophone company run by the church.
Rother briefly helped with Kraftwerk, but he won the reputation of being guitarist with the band Neu!, which at that time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the Cluster band to exile in Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, the ruins of the 16th century, lived as members of the communes who fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in Communion I, where Roedelius still dared to lopotite as a nanny.
Rather, it was life in such a Pitzweg art being.
The name for this art is allegedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the ashtray.
Many of this has preserved Harmony.
The first album was called "Harmonia Music" and the next was "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting the rosary wasn't just a self-recognition.
The now published CD "Live 1974" was cut in front of a record small, barely 50-member scene at the concert in Griessem.
Rother then made a wish that the members of Harmony would win and exercise on occasion.
For Roedlia and Moebia, that was a totally rude request.
In 1975 the band announced its dissolution.
Rother ended up in an esoteric sphere and he secured his future with the album "Hot Heart".
Cluster's band relived in the 1980s, and since then, it's been more successful than Harmony ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Grönland took the goal of krautrock as an original German contribution to live music.
The Neu! band was considered Roedeli's solo work at that time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Waldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
Brit will be present, Julian Cope, old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
That's what we've planned to do with the overall impact of the Cracow on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group fills out Harmony.
Brian Ena's branch, accompanied by the most dramatic sounds, is lifted in the hall: "The unique real music, it belongs to the future."
There are paintings on which the producer with Harmonia is in the agricultural seat.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the projection of other black and white photographs, on which are a set of instruments of wildly connected cables.
Before that, three veterans were again employed by improvisation.
Not by sticking microphones to organs and drums, so that the instruments can take out the never-heard self-made tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the techniques of inflammation of the pints.
It doesn't change the House of World Cultures.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, under the sound clouds whispers and in one beautiful place sings emphatically "Aaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always very English.
It's never been about rock.
We would find roots rather than in blues at music universities (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever screams "'68!" in this place isn't that far from the truth, but Harmony won't even be allowed to come out of peace right now.
Even the most self-evident is thoroughly thought through on the scene.
Where does the music start and when does it end?
This question either prepares a person for his nerves or allows him to experience passing moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
With the production of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden two films about the war on the Balkans appeared.
But none of them are convincing.
The motion picture either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or it's too touching.
The thing about The Hunting Party doesn't stop even an actor like Richard Gere.
Good news first: War criminals Karadić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian War, with actor Richard Gere vinegar.
In recent years, we have lost this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he has played many loving, unimportant roles in cool women's films, but in association with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, man will be given a taste for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is at once the strongest argument for seeing The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become a prey (Why must the names of films nowadays be so long and confused?).
Gere is performing magically. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what he could have become if fate and film industry were not so merciful: a man who has his best years behind him, but as a wreck like a monument still retains a certain remarkable charm.
But despite this trump is The Hunting Party along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinemas this week, only by continuing an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the movie Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who will save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, one of whom will fall in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbians are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television shallow film changes too soon in shooting and action.
There's a lot like the Cobra 11 show left in the movie, though it's not a highway, but it's wartime.
On The Hunting Party, you can clearly explore why the Balkan War has not yet succeeded in making a really good film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who appear behind the "lewich", a Serbian top war criminal, would in another time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (both Richard Shepard) be able to become the new "Apocalypse".
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is unable to do, but their path becomes the path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the film The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the mastery and sentimental cynic presented at the beginning.
On the contrary, the foreword will preface a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party film can finally be written off after reporting in the last five fast-track minutes of the film what NATO, the CIA and all the world's criminals have failed in the last five years: catching criminals and leaving him the fair revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of film production that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film, however, has a deep human message.
It condemns the fact that Karadić and Mladić are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (there they are extremely united), that under secret political agreements they do not engage in persecution sufficiently intensively.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, a woman will attack us with a famous poem from Brecht.
It deals with the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "With compassion I look at the swollen veins on the forehead, noting how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, they perform exactly such swollen heads that but indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the Balkan war.
Recently, all Hollywood films about Iraq were very unsuccessful in these newspapers.
To do this, one can add: No good film about South Africa has ever been produced.
It is almost always true: When the star hits the crisis area or passes through the minefield, a movie like the Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the border break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust, Schindler's list.
Many films must apparently mature - films which are now considered to be classic Vietnamese works - "Helen Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "Oloved Vest" - were not at any time celebrated as masterpieces.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers, then, do not have the ability that is needed to unmistakably tell good stories.
"Being or not" or "The Great Dictator" has become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin have yet to know how in a terrible way the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to create a sarcastic artistic view like novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked in the parallel between his historical novel "Lempris's Dictionary" and "the Balkan War", he said, "The image is only that some things never change.
The world will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beast collects criticism for refusing the Olympics
The mayor's withdrawal from the holding of summer Olympics in Hamburg has struck a sharp criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for water games.
Von Beast, however, urges realism in the estimation of chances.
The Chief Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday marked this decision "from the point of view of business for the unfortunate".
No other project has recently awakened in the city as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to keep this sport's political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which comes from the changed time plan."
Mayor Ole von Beast remained on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambition of Hamburg is unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide the Olympic candidate," von Beust told the newspaper WELL ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sport Alliance will decide on Mnich's candidate for the winter game in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance of having a time plan with the year 2028."
Yet this dream is not over, said von Beast.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) marked von Beust's statement of regret.
They will feel that Hamburg does not want to go to the Olympic Games for the next twenty-five years.
"It is too soon to destroy the chance that the plans will be marked buried at this early stage," President HSB Günter Ploss said Wednesday.
Failure to do so would be contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate, which he made at the general meeting of the General German University Sports Union.
Von Beust did not report to Hamburg candidate at the University in 2015 as a substitute for the organization of the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg High School Sports Union only nominated a candidate town last week.
The faction of the SPD in the Chamber of Hamburg pointed out that it was wasting valuable time on the construction of dwellings in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrooke area was delayed by the Senate for years because it had laid on the organization of the Olympiads and the construction of flats," said MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrooke still planned for the Olympics with the fact that the whole area would later be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously put on the "Olympic factor".
The competition for the summer Olympics in 2012 sparked great enthusiasm for its time in Hamburg.
But Hamburg crashed in Leipzig.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects Sweden and wooden boxes doesn't think about Andy Warhol, it's about Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden are thrown on the list of Warhol's works of dark shades.
Most of it on the list of the ninety-four "Brill of Boxes" of the Stockholm type are fakes.
After the "Expressen" Swedish newspaper, several months ago, expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo boxes" from 1968, there comes an internal research of the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm with the result of which it brought disappointment; six "Brillo boxes", which in 1995 the Moderna Muset Museum donated a gift to its former director Pontus Hulten, are copies - as well as most of the other Stockholm boxes that are on the international art market in circulation.
Previous events are a confusing, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo box in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes that were based on the red-robble design of paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard. They were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo factory.
It wasn't art works, it was their designs, it was just exhibition pieces.
Warhol also apparently gave in 1968 permission to produce several Brillo drums in Sweden, but they are not exhibited in Moderna Museet.
The present witnesses are now talking about fifteen crates that rightfully entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy" marked Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of Pontus Hulten later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred cases were produced and exposed in Sweden, which Warhol left for him.
In fact, 105 Hultén cases were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St Petersburg only in 1990.
Warhol was three years after his death at that time.
Lars Bystrom, the Supreme Conservator of Moderna Museet, examined in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their overgrazing boards were painted with basic paint and plastered, the brush was painted with oil white.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies showed that the paint was applied directly to the acrylic and not oil paint without the previous basic coating.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the Warhol's official document Brillo boxes," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittvja: "If Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six of his exhibition collections as "exhibitory material - copies".
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that these "criminal charges", which were raised in cases of soap boxes, would be dealt with.
But the organization still stands in unscrupulous silence.
Rebellious Soldiers in Manila Give Up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered to a hotel in Manila demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The insurgents commander Antonio Trillanes, who challenged the president of manipulation and corruption in elections, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked a hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers were ensnared in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court for the attempted coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used it to escape with his about 30 sympathizers.
The military officers who were supposed to guard him apparently crossed over to his side and joined in rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government loyal units of the area around the selected hotel have closed.
The president called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the acts of soldiers.
"People have had enough," said Triallnes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite unit Scout Rangers, said that other military units would join the march in a short time.
The critics of the government called for a major demonstration against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been credited with corruption.
The Manila Financial Region has already become the main history of the rebellion of about 200 troops against Arroy in 2003.
Since the insurgents refused to join the army, the rebellion failed for less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made in the Philippines to overthrow the democratically elected government.
