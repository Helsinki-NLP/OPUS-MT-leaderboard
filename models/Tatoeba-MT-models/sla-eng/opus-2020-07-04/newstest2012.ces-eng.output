Parliament did not support the novel liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the motion to repeal the paragraph on the basis of the amendment of the Criminal Code, which condemned the leader of the opposition, Julia Tymoshenko.
Members rejected the second reading of the proposal to reduce penalties for economic delinquency.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly inconvenient with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not competent, the appeal is to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the judgment as political vendetta of the regime, the suspicion of the court's bias has triggered a trial in the West as well.
The proposal that paragraph 365 should fall out of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the ex-mistress was convicted, supported 147 Members in the vote.
226 votes were required for its approval.
Libyan Victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan Rebélia, has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert without him after the war.
The winner remains to be defined.
As is the custom in the country, Islamists will win the election, but the question is whether moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary right of Sharia and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya becomes a crime-free country, because stealing is the cause of the hand.
Women may forget emancipation, possible faith-based apostates will be executed and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, a company consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There's going to be order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we wouldn't want.
But our way of life is not the only one, nor the objectively best, and probably would not suit the Libyans just mentioned.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors took credit for it with the help of faithless dogs.
It is only a matter of regret that from their point of view NATO did not drive NATO raids by some general from America, but Allah, whose size at each stage they celebrated.
So when the winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the political ally in the dictator's person without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, we don't buy Libya military.
The locals are going to get rid of the problem of expelling the "crosswords".
But will they have, without occupying the oil company, for a little bit of Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the unprofitable protection of human rights.
So unless you're told by Sharia's confessors.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are looking for investors.
The statistical smurf went beyond Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated, Germany and France are growing.
But today, the debt market is breaking records.
Investors no longer only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
The GDP of Germany increased by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data in the second quarter, in which Germany was better off than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), so France indicated that it appeared in a slight decline of 0.1% (original data talked about stagnation).
This third quarter of the Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent this year.
However, per quarter of the year, gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the Czech Republic, confirmed the trend of gradual slowing economic growth.
The results are worse than the estimates of analysts.
Most important events:
This third quarter of the Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent this year, but stagnated in the fourth quarter.
The German economy in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data, increased by 0.5 per cent.
The euro area's economy and the European Union grew by 0.2 per cent between July and September against the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 per cent year-on-year.
The yield on her ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are growing to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc....
The yields for Czech ten-year bonds are below 4% even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
From Germany, it is said that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate the 200 million procedure.
The football team's most difficult task of the season has been accomplished!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goalie Petr Jiráček won 1:0.
Czech football and with a great deal of luck in the second half of the season set off a luxurious head start from home retaliatory and will not be missed again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the procedural matches in detailed reports.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great deal of luck in the second.
The Czech representation also thanks to the homemade death to the finish, the great Czech and hero Jiráček won the Black Hora 1:0 and celebrates the procedure of the European Championship.
Because of the precise defence of the Czech whole, the Montenegrins got into pressure only in the second half.
The losers of the match became Damjanovich and Vučič, who burned two great chances.
Even thanks to the great Petr Čech, such Czech representations will not be missed at the European Championship next year, in addition, a reward of around 200 million crowns will be added to the national football register.
There's been a lot of fighting football since the initial minutes.
Both teams had difficulty getting involved in the combination and played mostly around half lines.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come in the first half, for the Czech defenses accurately averted a long holocaust.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred college students created a live shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They wish to express their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, the students prayed before the building and then called the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created live shields around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre, where uranium is being processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) stated that Iran seemed to have stopped pursuing nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is discussed in Israel.
At noon, the students prayed for the death of America and Israel to enter the nuclear facility in Isphahan.
In the event of an attack aimed at stifling Iran's nuclear programme as much as possible, the Israeli press would, in addition to the Isfahan centre, also aim at facilities in Natanz in which uranium is enriched.
Hairdresser: not breakfast and dinner feces
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with an excessive weight of 9 percent of schoolchildren and overweight being 5 percent of children.
Obedient children, however, usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey has shown.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns it surrounds.
At tables in obese children, for example, there are up to half the number of ewes found in children with normal weight.
Fried fries had a day before the study in connection with an event called Obezita, which was not an accident of more than 19 percent of the obese.
In the fat families, sports are also not used, but most of the families of today’s schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children replied that their parents will find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and was attended by almost 900 children from elementary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the event Obezita is not a coincidence that supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from the 4th to 8th grade have joined the project.
Proper diet and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic rise in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of those questioned, for example, said that she was given five meals a day in the breakfast-swirl-swirl dinner regime, which is one of the basic prerequisites of proper nutrition," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no feces
Experts point out that for healthy development there are also relative details, including regular family breakfast times.
In the Czech Republic, at the same time, only 23 percent of schoolchildren’s families have breakfast at the same time.
Most families eat each other's breakfast.
And the worst part was finding that there was no breakfast at all in a dozen households.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily meal.
The questionnaire showed that the families of obese children are more likely to consume unhealthy fries.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent).
Although he regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children questioned, the result was less than half - 15 percent.
Get your menu together.
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to come together from the offered options of their own dining room according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of floury, fatty and sweet dishes.
"The alarm is particularly important for the fondness of sweet lemonade," the final survey report states.
For lunch as the main meal won past the pasta just above the poultry.
But children practically didn’t want legumes, and it’s also low on fish and midday vegetables.
Addiction to health
At the same time, research has shown that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"For the group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the Obezita lecture, there is no coincidence, in a number of cases, a significant shift in preferences towards healthy nutrition principles," the results of the project are given.
For example, it was brandish for sweet lemonades, where more children would begin to prefer regular water.
Children also have more frequent brushing in the questionnaire poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and would limit the sweet food and dumplings.
Styllist must also be a good psychologist, claims pro
In the opening article on how stylists are taught, I complained a little that there was a lot of this in the opening hours.
I had no idea what would follow.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, wearing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the set.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "found."
This time, Director Alice and I were discussing (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly proportional figure.
And most of them are.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy figure with no proper curves and someone's overweight again.
Stylista must know how to tighten the wide shoulders, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got as tips as with a woman of the type Jennifer Lopez, i.e. bigger tits and hips and tight waist, character well emphasized and at the same time a woman not to dress too challenging.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is such that the skirts or pants really do not fit, then it is worth keeping at least one such piece in order.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly falling clothes are for no payment.
In a dress for peace you will feel much better than in one that keeps moving you, grabbing you, falling away in a waist and the like.
A boy figure can again afford to wear clothes with glossy, apps, embroidery or engraving.
Of course there's a lot of information and types of characters, so I'm glad I have all week to get all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid, given my homework, it's up to the point.
Each of the courses received an assigned celebrity, designed to invent two outfits: daytime and evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the personality as well as the type of character.
I'm gonna dress up for Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, I am certainly better off than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred kilos (please take care of the excess) or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut clothes from magazines or search the Internet and print and then process graphically.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relationship to graphic design.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is important.
Stylista does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific purposes, such as cable, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it's not until Sunday.
Styllist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture, filled with information on character types, was attended by three guests from the field.
Stylista Honza Humor, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilful stylist can work with one piece of different clothes.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, such a t-shirt (or if you want to initially trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and shirt like a coat, but you can also wear it on a bare body, around a boat and take photos of it as a dress.
Or just up your sleeves or your collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
Most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jakub.
Finally, I can see why we are immersing ourselves in all those lessons that we combine with what, why, when we see something else in fashion magazines.
Don't even talk about shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist has to have more options than how many of them to take pictures of.
So for a fashion story that's going to have ten sides (then ten outfits), I have to be ready to "get up" at least fifteen.
And also that the picture of the dress looks and works in combination with other pieces slightly different than in fact.
So we have to count on that when creating an outfit.
That an image and a style makes a success of half, confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna, which isn't exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to stylist services is rather chilly so far.
Even familiar faces consider him to be useless (just because I know something, what I look like is secondary).
And if someone's already allowed us to create styling, then we're supposed to count on them to dictate with great probabilities a completely different (less) size than they really do.
Then there's no more to googly and see if the boulevard has written about the fact that the celebrity has become fattened and lost and so on.
Honza and Mario laid our hearts on Sundays that stylist's mind was not enough to fit in fashion and be able to fold the outside.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he wears, and so it is important to be also a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to offer themselves, to stand up for yourself.
"When a manager orders you to change her wardrobe and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw out her entire closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find there at least a few things you commend and recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "payer", or the bag on the plaza.
It's the one you put around your waist and you've got all the necessary propriets on you.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, wool on hair or closing pins, there are also nylon thread (with it the stylist helps with the photographing of products such as purses or hats), special clips that we fold in the back of the clothing, if it is larger (the pin or other clamps are not allowed, would destroy the garment), or the staple.
So that we don't just listen, but we've also tried something, and we've learned how to fit our shoes correctly.
Even when taking pictures in a studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch the shoes with our scissors to make sure they don't get hurt.
So there is a real need for skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reservation.
She's not really a friend of mine.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend course.
I'm starting to get more and more clear that taking on styling at a professional level really isn't a walk with a pink set, let alone who wants what he wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run race across America.
Review
Originally, a carefree ride is transformed by a series of unnecessary bullshit errors into a routine morning journey to the shichte.
Although the ambition has succeeded to a large extent, it is not valid when no one seems to want to do anything else.
A new part with the subtitle The Run awake before issuing high expectations.
He promised that the summer racing series Need for Speed would once again move a piece in a new direction and from playable displays appeared as a game that would not have to be just a number in the genre of action racing.
We were also curious as to how the inserted passages would come, in which the main hero would step out of the car and pass through his own.
As with the NFS series, however, many are slightly different from what we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but they all drag down a few unnecessary errors that have appeared in the series for several years or so.
So it's actually not even a mistake, but rather an incomprehensible expression of developers' sloths.
The adventure begins very well.
You are presented in a story whose main hero Jack has some personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit behind the steering wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it a few interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than 50 races.
It follows that each race is on another track and the stages in question are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
Man doesn't have a moment to feel like the game is still offering the same thing.
Some of the environments are also very nice in sight, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing worldly.
But driving across the desert, in the autumn landscape, or high in snowcapped mountains, is visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are once in a while sealed with some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught up in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to let an avalanche go to sleep.
In addition, there are quite good competitions in place.
There's only a few of them, but that's enough.
In this way you try to get ahead of the desired number of opponents (in essence a classic race), then you catch up again with time (classical fight with tracks) and then you have a duel with the only opponent waiting for you.
The police will come to this point from time to time, which makes all your efforts even more unpleasant.
The news is the passages out of the car.
Rather, it's just an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone, and you have to help him by printing the right buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, however, these passages are much less in play than you would expect (in particular, perhaps just three).
In the result, however, it is for the benefit of the matter, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above, it is thus among the elements that the game sharpens.
The riding model is in the footsteps of previous parts.
That means there's definitely no one in today's world, but it can't be said that it would be an objection.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But in a more well-defined race, the driving model here still fits quite well, even though we can find better in competition.
Until now, then, everything is in complete order.
Problems, however, begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer very good.
We do not expect the game of this type to number complex deformations and collisions, but when practically before any impact into any object you have the slightest idea how your car behaves, then probably not everything is all right.
Typically, you will only easily lick each other when you cross cars or roll cars in normal traffic, but other times in almost identical situations, your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even go straight ahead.
With the reboot system, it doesn't matter, but it will make you feel safe.
The reboots are solved so that if you break or go far off the track, you will be thrown back at the last catch point on the track.
But only five restarts are available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you must start the race again from the beginning.
It is, therefore, more of an aid in the event that something is not going to happen than that you could rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes even reboots won't help, they'll have to learn the section of the race to remember.
The big failure of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you just do not fit in.
On another occasion, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration whenever you get there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It's particularly frustrating in situations when you see a rival driving between two opposing cars passing easily before you, while when you get there, there are already cars in such a position that you have to surround them or fasten them.
It doesn't matter when you reach them because it's "calculated" so that the situation always comes right in front of your nose.
The contestants have another advantage.
During the whole time, you will find a few places where, no matter how time, you will always be preceded by the same opponent in the same place.
Most of all, it hits the end of the long bridge game, where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent must be there in front of you, apparently, at any cost.
If he's driving ahead of you, he's making it worse for you to get an overview of the vehicles you're driving, so at first, you're going to have a good spread a couple of times.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more tense and adrenaline-like, but the performance is so obvious that it will surely quickly miss you.
And it's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, it's fun to play and places so much action that sometimes you literally don't get to watch where it flies.
And it doesn't really matter whether it's worth the concept of 50 unique tracks, sorting races so that boredom doesn't have a chance or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to exchange cars during races.
You have to be careful about petrol pumps by the way, because that's where you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you're enough with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The spores are suitable for urban areas, strong American storms on straight highways and exotic supersports for technical rides, for example after the short mountain trips.
With the main story regime goes hand in hand and fashion challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points into your profile, which is common to challenges and story.
Different items are secreted to obtain higher driver levels: starting cars and ending with backgrounds for profile.
It is also linked again with the Autolog online function, which compares your results with other players and provides additional community functions.
One of the other hard to understand is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you get to the subway tunnel, where you marry it in the dark on the tracks (below).
On the tachometer, you get numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (will be) and in this, the subway set will be attached from behind, and uncompromisingly you will be slaughtered.
In the editorials, I think we'll have a few more days to discuss whether nobody really thought about us or whether the authors think we're really such a big jerk.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in some cases even great.
It will so freeze that in some of the more opulent moments, the imagery decreases, in some cases quite tragically.
However, this is mainly the case with a larger number of participants, where you would not be able to get any more smooth shots.
The sound page is fine and soundtrack is a question of taste.
In an effort to enjoy the best range of younger audiences, a soundtrack came from the category "every dog other row", but it can be assumed that due to listening to music, the game probably won't be bought.
The total impression from Need for Speed: The Run is so desperately desperate.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
But this is how the game works unfinished.
I'm sure it's fun, but be prepared to make mistakes in the eyes by the strength of the airport lights.
Pěvecká chory UK will ring at the Student of the Summit concert
The celebration of International Student Day and the anniversary of the Single Revolution with a musical experience has already been the third festival of Festa Academica.

Ambassador to EU Vicenová:
Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly violated the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle a little, calm down and before all the players get used to their new roles," she began her lecture at the Faculty of Law by the Czech Ambassador at the European Union Milena Vicenová.
As far as her motto "Accomprehensible and open about Europe" is concerned, she has already shown in the first part of her lecture when she has managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a transparent and understandable way that a number of lecturers from the UK Faculty of Law could envy her.
Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was a criticism that he was inconclusive that he was a grey official, that he could not play any role, and I must say that everyone had the breath of that role, that it was well done."
"It is a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them perfectly and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call?", therefore, as a significant step towards unification and greater clarity of EU policy vis-à-vis countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban the sirens.
Vicenová has also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency considered it a success.
The Czechs dealt with the coming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis, or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time was then considered to be a major negative, which had severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very urgent at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, the "fact of Fremol" was not only the Presidency but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being resolved to date.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is making the current economic situation difficult.
Whether the budget will be narrow and cost-effective, which the sectors will be given the advantage of which countries will be more supported and which are less, all on the agenda of the next negotiations.
She also reminded the Ambassador of her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Europe is understandable".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, a chain that no one understands.
How should a citizen understand that there are really no curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of various size or that someone really needs to ban the sirens."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and to get more Czechs to European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice those negatives rather than positive things.
In addition, she is sorry for the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
She believes there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she raised the strength and cooperation of the Visagrad Four.
"Believe me that when Polák and Hungarian come to me and the Slovak comes to me, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what is your Visegrad Four?" and doesn't look excited at it at all."
In the future of the Union, according to the Vicens, the new rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States are largely pending.
As a very realistic one, he sees the concept of a two-speed, non-multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European Federation".
"We have euro area countries and countries outside the euro area."
"We have an area of Schengen, we have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only countries that wanted to cooperate and those who didn't want to go further."
"These institutions will be more and it will be a very two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all the issues affecting the whole Union are to be discussed between all Member States, not only among euro area countries.
Brand history:
IBM innovator begins his second century existence
If someone were looking for a word that most accurately expresses IBM's strategy, it would probably be the "longevity" closest.
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is perceived as very modern, yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation of this longevity was the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already broken the code that many of the world’s problems can easily be solved if people are willing to think.
His "Think" password thus became the seal around which the life of the future giant (as well as the name of the internal magazine that began to be published in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for hundreds of years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second hundred we can achieve even more," said current director Samuel J. Palmisano on the anniversary.
Processed system
Watson, in the 1930s, treated his employees in the same way as Bátě's entrepreneur in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had as one of the first American employees paid a vacation, insurance from employer plus elegant employee uniform and a developed system for rewarding the best inventors and traders.
IBM also has a long-term relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company has been brilliant in extracting talents - as one of the world's first companies has abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, headed by IBM, will replace the woman Virginia Rometty next year.
She's been in IBM for 30 years, she's still in charge of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called caves in recent years, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovation emerge.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institution with a good name
One business position provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technological company," said Professor Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems for the use of technology," George Colony from Forrester Research consulting company added.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it looks familiar with its logo in the United States - grew into one of the world's largest firms in a hundred years.
It is obviously the most comprehensive technological company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
They hold the most patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees won Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a bar code, or a floppy disk.
IBM was about $220 billion the second largest technology company this year, according to market capitalization (first Apple), when it first caught up with Microsoft since 1996.
Front View
Not all products and innovations have scored into customers' tastes and times - IBM has, for example, failed to pay a bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online Prodigy or IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built on the move forward, you cannot emotionally connect to the past," Samuel J. Palmisano notes.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, they're leaving.
Unlike competitive Microsoft, which essentially stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM has the largest share of services on the market, with about a fifth of it being software and hardware.
As early as 1990, he was with more than half the most powerful hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold only $15 billion in profitable assets, during which time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008, the first time the world has gone beyond the modern financial crisis.
IBM is acting according to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis.
IBM's stock price has risen 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, the company's net profit is steadily rising.
IBM's business password is to change everything, just not its values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if the next crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
History of IBM: From cheese cutter to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally had a complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over only in 1924 - originally it was a brand used for branches of the company in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM gave a merger to four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies like famous "pusses," which means hours recording employees coming and leaving.
The architect of the new company was Mr. Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairing the company’s supervisory board by 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then shaded the founder of IBM - on Watson's ideas is still built an irrefutable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from meat cutters and cheese to cashiers.
During the first four years that Watson was in charge of the company, he doubled his turnover to nine million dollars and began an extensive expansion of the company into all the worlds.
Watson was so irresistible to the company that after nearly forty years in the chair, his son Thomas Watson Junior replaced him.
Under his leadership IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly to space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 to the famous years of man on the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family - a number of IBM System/360.
The classic "pesque," which set the computer standard at the time, named IBM 5150 came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold the production of the computers of the Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, bought a consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote its full attention to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, "smarter planets".
Its aim is to make smart use of technology in areas not planned so far and to improve the situation in urban transport or management, for example.
For the area of trade, IBM recently launched a "Smartter Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country as well.
She founded her branch in the then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a research team at the world level dealing with voice recognition.
A concierge about an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep the donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtárová (53) said the end!
After her husband Joseph Rychtár (53) became not only Protector Iveta Bartosová (45), but also lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now it's not right to wait and make clear the rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," said Rychtář.
When Darina Rychtářová provided asylum to Bartosová in her home in the summer, she probably didn't even seem to know how her marriage would end.
Although Iveta moved from the Greek after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, her husband’s relationship with her was at peace with her, and now she even gave him good - bye forever.
The Richter doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Richtary and Bartos had only broken up once, he wouldn't be waiting at home for his wife's open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will expel him."
"He will live, not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," revealed Rychtárová with the fact that she has alienated herself from her husband and he only insists on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina closed his back door doesn't matter yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveto, and I'm not going to change it."
"The wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"Darina and I are having a pretty normal conversation, except that we don't share a bed together," said Lightning Knight.
If Richtary finds new love too, she won't be defending her.
"We're not sleeping together, and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has any boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and take on all my responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worst women's bad habits: Are they with you?
When you ask men if they can name some typical female bulwarks, they're usually all in one. They're very eager to get out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are several female customs that can perfectly pump blood in the veins?
Shopping
Does your second half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like buying and buying in discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should be slowing down their shopping passions at least a little.
But tell me, who would resist it just going through clothes stores, looking for themselves well-falling tops, and then try them all (ideally in different color versions) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell of a thing for men.
Just remember how many times you've told your friend to wait for you before the front door...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are quite allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
Stronger sex also agrees that the frequency of this complaint increases, making women more annoying.
Order and Purity in First Place
It's like an endless collapsing.
Wash windows, draining, polishing, dusting, fluttering - at least twice a week.
You're counting on your partner to slap his dirty foot on a clean rug, the kids, to mess up a drained sink and put on a glass living wall with the polishing of which you've done so much work?
In the event that you suffer this "refoulement", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and purity should definitely not be the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can endanger your relationship and family well - being.
Grinding
"You used sweatpants go into the basket."
"You're gonna wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"The wet wipe is not on the ground."
If you feel that way a few times a day with your partner, know that you are able to dial him with confidence.
Of course you don't mean anything wrong, you want to make everything okay.
Maybe if the men knew, women wouldn't have to go back to them so much...
Apologizing, twitching
For some women there are also rumors, gossips, and insults and association against others.
Women are focused on relationships, and so they like to talk about things like who, where, who, how, and why.
I hope each of us has a small, harmless gossip or a curse to release here.
The hand of the heart, it's in the hands of all women.
The opposite is the gossip of the deepest grains that they like and often scratch, perhaps repudiate and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially in the context of women's work community.
Jagr and Voráček helped with the aids to win Philadelphia
Hockey assailant Jaromír Jagr participated in a Monday's NHL match with two aids to the Philadelphia 5:3 win on the ice of Carolina and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, a nine-year-old star who added another win and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assists in the match were also recorded by Jagr's co-player, Jakub Voráček.
Jag after the game told the overseas journalists that Giroux was predicting a big evening.
"Before the game, I told him he'd give Hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you'll be overwhelmed by that feeling," explained Jag, after which Giroux scored a goal from the first shot of Flyers.
A few minutes later, he had a second hit on the Czech team.
The raven fought over the Hurricanes corner and presented it to Maxi Talbot in the circles.
The second before the first break, Patrick Dwyer was reduced in the weakened home player, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After working with Jagrem, he scored a third goal, then replayed his shot in the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best league player, but he certainly is among the best three," Jagri said his center.
"I never thought I'd play with hockey like him at the end of my career."
"I'm happy for that."
"I want to play him."
"All those years at the NHL my teammates tried to play at me, now it turns around," Jag said.
Carolina still made a drama, the goal of Tuoma Ruutua, and again the Dwyer, who was forced out of the criminal shooting, came across one goal.
Yet another complication did not allow Matt Read, who completed the renumbering of two to one.
"Wonderfully hit our Pronger zone."
"He pulled the wheel, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to the far pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," he described the final goal of the match from his perspective Voráček.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference.
Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špacek did not win the match against Buffalo, retired in the second third due to injuries in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens also lost the two-way lead next to the tested beak and lost after a penalt shot of 2:3.
One of their raids did not change Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach rather than the lost points froze an extensive rear row array, with only five defensemen winning the match.
"It's bad."
"We only played games with one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's just nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The altercation of the alternating was rolling at us, and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game more, move the knock from our band."
In that we had gaps," added one of P. K. Subban's defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 hits of Winnipeg to win 5:2 over Tampo Bay.
Five different shooters split into goals of Jets who interrupted a five-track series of pro-games.
How travel prices have developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold only crumbs in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists so traveled on vacation to the sea to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Socia in Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when travel was also possible to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime joined the West and the Czech tourists' journey to Yugoslavia were then very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually, even within socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed a letter of invitation from that country, otherwise there was no individual route possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to line up overnight with a sleeping bag or to have "good friends" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely currency exchangeable, so without a foreign currency commitment it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the trip to the West.
Far more often, though, the Czechs spent their holidays in the country, resulting in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs have acquired and this habit survives to this day.
This has been the experience of Czech travel since 1989 of the real revolution.
While vacationing in the NDR or Bulgaria by 1989 was our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that we are not aware of today is that it was not possible to travel freely to the most popular of Croatia until 1989, as it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Immediately in the late 1990s, the visa requirement for neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, starting with a huge wave of short-term visits mainly by Austria's Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't get a trip to the West for a long time, everybody wanted to see it for a while.
In Paris, for example, Czech tours in tent plots were burned, since our then earnings did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czech travel at this time was the driving of your own food, canned, salami, etc. to save yourself.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely interchangeable Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists to buy the Western currency freely after many dozens of years.
However, our standard of living, including average wages, increased at another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to increased demand for travel, travel agencies have regularly started to prepare tours of charter air links since 1997, making it possible to negotiate quantitative discounts in comparison to the past incredibly slow.
At the end of the 1990s, Czech visa-free contact in virtually all the developed countries of the world, except the US, has continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of the revolutionary journey occurred just in 2000, when due to a considerable demand he was sent from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exoticism, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters will fly with Czech tourists to warm far countries every year, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic country is currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US lifted the visa for Czech tourists and this has definitely ranked our country among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs also spent more than half of their foreign holidays for the first time in history (50.3%) and spent for the first time in history on one foreign holiday, including the cost of staying more than 15 000 CZK per person.
The General Meeting is to find the President, but he is threatening to fall again.
Almost five months is Czech football without a chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hasek will not be known at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after another extraordinary general meeting that will take place Thursday in Nymburca.
There is still no agreement on which electoral order to proceed.
Without it, he will not vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest of running Czech football is given by Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hasek resigned in his post in June and on his departure called on colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Haskov, football has slipped back to the ploys between the two union chambers, which are unable to agree on a common candidate.
This turned out to be fully on 16 September, when the new President was to be elected.
The delegates of the general meeting went to the National House in Prague for nothing, as the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a method of election.
There has not been any agreement on who has the right to vote at the meeting - whether only the statutory representatives, or also full-power officers.
In this one point since then, there has been a partial agreement which has also helped the recommendations of the Constitution for the State and the law according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
But there are still disputes over the electoral order.
The executive committee, which is no longer in its deliberations, whether it is proper or exceptional, has not dealt with anything else very clearly.
The view of the option has changed several times, but the neurolgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd wheel to rule out the possibility of heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," stated one of the three vice-presidents of FAČR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the proposed model in the third round, the candidate will win a higher percentage of aid in the chamber than he will run for.
Morava is allegedly willing to step aside to win a candidate who gains a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the advantage in this percentage calculation.
"Although that would be the meaning of the two previous wheels, that would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian side of Svoboda, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the terms of the election order are most appropriate for Pelt from all candidates.
"I wish it would be elected according to statutes as soon as possible."
"To avoid inventing some pre-eminent nonsense like in the last general meeting," said the owner Victoria Plzeň, who has been running for the first time and in his statements he has set out against Pelt in particular.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburca, he believes the new president will be known and believes that the candidates will work constructively together in the future.
"All passions will calm today's national team's action at the European Championship."
"The football will again be at a happy wave, it will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who has the most experience in managing football from the top three times at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl's a bit more slow.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very complicated."
"It's not between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt regulations purposely."
"This could cause the General Meeting to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, that common sense prevails," Rajchl said.
There isn't much time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some meetings were supposed to be held directly in Montenegro, but who knows if football generality will be complete in the game.
The flight special in which they were to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not fly out of Prague due to a technical breach in the morning and looked for a replacement variant, as part of the executive committee to the history of the Bargain Revenge.
Finally, there may be a decisive ministerial meeting that may occur on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Body Association, Josef Dobeš, would like to bring the divided parties inside the strongest sport association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the planned general meeting of the Czech Republic, which will address the new direction of Czech sport in the financial problems of Sazka.
Pack goes to fight for president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the head of footballers Plzně Tomáš Paclík saw a strong candidate before an extraordinary general meeting who fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have submitted himself to the fight for a top function.
"If a good adept existed, I'm fighting for it, and I'm not going to vote."
"But in the current situation no one could find it," said the ČTK Pack.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchlem, Paclík's wife Motivation to precisely Pelt, the alleged favourite of the election, tried to prevent him from leading the FACR.
Paplík also emphasises that in the event of his victory, he would only hold the presidency until 2013, when a proper general meeting is on the agenda.
In a function, he would like to see an experienced and top-of-the-line manager who is not too connected to a football event.
"I've spoken to some people who would come to the attention."
"It was crazy for me when some people said that at this point they didn't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I would like to change such a view," he said.
Paclík is told that, of all things, Pelt's connection with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Union, Roman Berbrem, a man with controversial reputation, who is known as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at a general meeting.
For Paclík, it is so unacceptable that Pelta becomes the chair.
"If he won, he's reserving the current state, and nothing in the football would move forward."
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a powerful trader, it would not have benefited football even more," said Paklek.
It also appears that Pelt's name appeared years ago in a post office in an investigation into the corrupt affair, from which Pelt came out without punishment.
"I don't know the prestige that Pelt's win would bring."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paplík, who is also taking note of his earlier statement that he would "sold the Pilsen Club if Pelta became chairman".
However, if Paclík triumphed in the Thursday election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
He is also considering another Rajchl candidate, who was supported by Paclík in front of the shining general crowd, which ended with fiasco.
"He would be the first person I'd go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him, like, as the head of the team."
"But the manager couldn't manage the association."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't do it," said Paklek, who in September aroused great attention by standing in front of the Human Macel, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
The pack says he'd take the lead in the association.
He has appealed to his ability to run private companies, and since last year he has also been in charge of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the Prime Minister's League Triumf.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to its particular cultivation."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which should tend to affect the disciplinary and appeal committee, which goes to the most disgusting situations," said the Paclík, who do not blame their antipathy for, for example, the Parthenian boss Daniel Křetínsko.
One of the priorities would also be to consider the tightening of FACHR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby political tops for more money from lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key things that the new President should address."
"If there is a gambling tax, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but on an equal footing they must say where the money goes," he noted.
As a burden now, Paclík does not accept his connection with the Pilsen Club, even though he himself claims that the Chairman of the FACHR should be "super-stricken".
Pelta is back in touch with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Duklo.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see the point in turning my stock into a hypocrite into a diaper club, and in a year and a half, I went back," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FAČR tents that would rule out the election pat
Two days before the general assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that, in the event of an election, the FACHR should have new statutes that would definitely rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec officer is optimistic before the Thursday meeting in Nymburst and believes that the election fight will significantly dampen the possible success of today's football team.
Pelta had already promised before the glowing failed election that it was for representation and financial gain to be concentrated in the event of election.
In the election before the last general meeting, he decided to go at the last minute, so he could have a two-month delay in defending his ideas of soccer management and presenting himself in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect to know the chairman on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for the association to lead," says a man who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who has served for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the union.
That's why he thinks he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He believes that the current election problems are euphoria, which prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June general meeting, the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If there were no different interpretations, we should have given the chairman since September," Pelt warned.
The recasting of the most important document of civil society has just been considered a history for delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if this fails."
"It's a fundamental thing that we can't be without," Pelt says.
He said he's trying not to define himself against his rivals.
He had previously promoted that he could imagine working with Henry Rajchl, who was recognized for his legal education, and well knows that his anti-candidate would be his first vice president.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík long enough to leave a thread dry on Pelt.
"In football is moving for over a year, he's had some success."
"But his attacks were lewd and many people jumped in the way of the election campaign."
"And so a number of them now doubt its true character," said Pelt, who said to remain faithful to the rumours he had already announced in September.
His most powerful weapon, he says, is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the post-representation.
It should be an exposition box of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs by beginning with the Bohemian cause or the sound of last year's corrupt scandal."
"I would then step up to the negotiations with the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the entire football," said the Czech Republic's twenty-four-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his coming to the head of football would mean no personnel cleaning.
"I would first have to get acquainted with the filling of individual employees," he pointed out to Fear, where there is an understandable nervousness out of the long indisposed.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany a general crowd, he believes that Thursday he will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If it's the only controversial point, how it's going to vote in the third round, we can get through it."
"Fothbal needs credibility, and only gets it by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains two days before the likely decisive day of her functional career with optimism.
Rajchl promises that under him FACHR would start working hard.
If the new chairman of the Czech Football Association of the Czech Republic was elected at the fourth general meeting by former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises to work hard in the event of his election.
He wants to promote systemic change and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians bail, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and to continue the work that former President Ivan Hasek began.
"As President, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with the Czech Republic.
"I'm a team player, and I want to share competences in the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to certain areas."
"And I will hand out hard tasks to move football forward by one mile in each of these segments."
"Many people would probably not be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to be doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks under my feet and question my every step," he explained why he hesitated.
"Many people told me I couldn't give up because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He's also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Haske.
"In the last two years, a lot of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it away right now."
"There are open-ended processes that will be heard in a few years' time, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with concern that in the event of the election of another candidate Miroslav Pelty, the situation of the union could be restored before Haske.
"I believe in systematicness, and that's a thing that I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"There are people behind him who would do football in such a way that he would be the only one chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but I'm sure it's not that I'm taking sides."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the election," observed Rajchl.
It also echoes the claim that he would be only the Czech president.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I intend to make the most of it for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts whose winners would go to the first league."
"This would not be the current situation where only three moral groups are in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen Club Tomáš Paclík was also involved in the fight for the president, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its Vice-President and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, TV contracts and lottery law negotiations as his successes.
On the contrary, it is a joint that the union does not stretch for one rope.
While Pelt claims to be "disqualified from returning to Czech football trust", the other of Paclík's rivals considers him a strong candidate who has a lot to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen for that year."
"If he had been elected, perhaps he would have continued in those things that Ivan Hasek started here, and would not have changed the board's staff. "
"He wouldn't want to twist it in his favor," evaluates Rajchl's rivalry.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Blue jump
Julia Stanek
The Brosdallery from Ufon's view, a fancy swimming pool in Budapest: who travels to Europe can experience his blue miracle - and, after visiting cities or traveling, let his tired feet rest in thermal baths.
The book will show where wellness by water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder appeared in the last one and a half years on discovered roads, her luggage should not be missing: her swimsuits.
The lying sign on the water, looking up to the height of the artisticly shaped dome, swimming across the marble path (building a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admiring carefully restored secession swimming pool.
If she liked a boat, she carried it into her notebook - even with remarkable details about the way the building was constructed and the history of the building.
More than 200 floats examined the architecture of Meder in this way and present them now in their newly published book "Badefreuden (Buying Radost)": Human floating plants in Munich, the historical palace of the floats in Schwarzwald, "The Hard Core of Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "Cesta for the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of plováren culture.
With sport it doesn't go too far, says Meder - only in water it's something else.
To anger it is only that fanciful swimming must be satisfied with blue tiles and chlorine odors, while health runners can inhale the stunning smell of the spruce forests or listen to the happy birding in the park.
"One day I asked why floating boats must always be so ugly," Mrs. Meder said in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice sailing boats."
Water level doubles architecture
Melting in a skokan swimming pool and essential oil for sauna - the factor of comfort is so great that it concerns all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, they could be sailboats with a real trap for the eyes: "The place of the floor is a man in the pools of water."
"She is transparent, on the other hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: the high cellar, the colorful tiles, the jumping boards.
The "Badefreuden (Buying Pleasures) " is providing on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis wellnes - but above all, the desire to jump into blue.
Remarkable specimens have been discovered by Mrs. Meder's collector in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi spas in Budapest, she found water containing nitrates in the original karst cave (Micholc-Tapolca cave) as well as thermal baths whose swimming pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in the bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
In contrast, many heated swimming plants under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria offer a wonderful view. While a person has a window from the Curiš rooftop swimming pool in the eyes of the whole city, he can watch the snow - covered Arlberg in the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like the oufo that just landed in the Alps.
Out of the three top open pelvis in winter rises steam while in the background of the mountain Ötztalu to heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool stood Mrs. Meder's pool collector smell of chlorine in the flue.
Many thermal baths are smelling after cheese, in the Arpád spas in Hungarian Békescsab it smells like oil to the point that a person hardly believes he has reached the spas.
The smell comes from medicinal water containing alkaline hydrogen carbonates, which is almost black and whose sediments extrude on the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special experience of wellness.
However, there was also one place Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful baths: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate bath Luhačovice, she ran into a closed terrain.
In 1902 by architect Dušan Jurkovic the proposed spas were closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the falling windows of a red-white-yellow sectional building, she saw a wide range of weeds growing between the tiles.
They stood against this in a magic swimming pool in Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wilbad.
These spas are already behind three stages of construction; a person can discover not only the newly-Romani elements that come from the time of their creation in 1844, but also the Mauritian hall in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995 Palais Thermal is a popular spa spot, a pool expert, Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because she is from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some performance to combine so diverse building blocks into such a beautiful complex," said Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace, immersing in a thermal pool is apparently a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check the commodity trade.
Christian Teevs
Leaves Deutsche Bank to trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the head of the group wants to produce consequences.
Hamburg -
For the general public, it is clear that 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials as wheat or maize, according to one study.
Two thirds of those questioned even require Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to step out of this trade because the problems of the poorest world are deepening.
This is the result of the Forsa poll commissioned by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the global commodity exchange bets push prices up to a height and therefore the banks carry co-operation on the global hunger problem.
A consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Chief Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although also big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that participants in the capital market with the interest in high-risk trades have deviated from the offer and demand - and profited from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he reacted to Ackermann's criticism: He promised that the attacks would be investigated and said that no business "is worthy of the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake".
According to the information, SPIEGEL ONLINE controls the international working group of the Foodwatch-Report raids.
By the end of the year, the control is to be closed, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank board - together with a recommendation on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the banks then want to report the consequences.
At the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working with self-help on his image.
The Chief of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his financial sector criticism: "The betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastic how carelessly banks are harming the general welfare today."
Let Ackermann be the highest banking lobbyist on duty.
"Deutsche Bank must delete from its portfolio all items for which money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is hungry or a reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's perspective appears at first sight to be surprising, but it is clear that the corporate boss would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he left the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not go to the supervisory board otherwise than planned.
By turning away from controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And there's no need to worry about any losses - he should deal with it eventually with his successor.
Each other would have denounced its investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to keep a high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Institute Forsa asked 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
As a result, 11 percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are linked to food price bets.
Many customers of banks would also produce personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: Everyone else would, as a result of the poll, make all the investments for which money flowed into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn those known to such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about canceling their account and go to another institution.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy end: The Austrian pavilion from the World Show in Brussels 1958 won prices, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and left behind.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When it burns for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials, which are typical for the belief in technological progress, then Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Show 1958 is an excellent and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then given the Grand Prix d'Archiveture for its light and veneerable construction of steel and glass.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He celebrated the architect by also building a pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibitions.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW Palace plus as the key made by the side construction in Munich, in late 1973 he celebrated internationally.
As a temporary exhibition building designed by a pavilion after the world exhibition, he was placed in Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (Southern Station), renovated and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - was named "The House of the 20th Century".
However, for the museum the building was not suitable, nor were there technically or spatially - walls were missing for hanging artistic exhibits, no satisfactory climate.
However, it was used until the present art awaited a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been crawling more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilion reconstructed, now bears the title "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum of Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy purpose in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco was established, which became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery.
Husslein-Arco, the promoted art historian with an outstanding career, i.e. in the youth of the karsourcler, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum, and as founding director of Musea modern Salzburg, promoted a remarkable reconstruction in politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Brórubka should be displayed by the same name foundation, a coffee shop and bookshop should be created, and an office building would have to be built.
Close supervision, low budget.
To perform it was then Krischanitz ideally cast.
Not only did he sensibly reconstruct and extend Joseph Olbrich's Cece Buildings in Vienna and win the competition, but because Schwanzer studied at the Vienna Technical University and pavilion was "an extremely important place" for him, at which he "almost every weekend" watched exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had lost its generosity and ease in moving to Vienna and changing its use.
At the current reconstruction there were far greater problems: the building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The windows of the glass facade were replaced, the glass fibers of the reinforced insulating glass and the glass roof were replaced by a special safety glass.
The cold bridges-steel nostrils have been strengthened or replaced, and the asbestos-filled ceilings have been repaired.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a closed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost new construction, but still a lofty Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door was preserved, the building is painted in an old anticorrosive red-brown tone.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all of that for the strict supervision of the memorial service and the low budget.
"Often had to be found material that is good and cheap and also liked the Memorial Office," Krischanitz says, pointing to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstructions, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and yet wants "to be properly self-confidence".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place because there has been a urban happy accident: In the circle around the Schweizer Garten there is a completely newly designed "City district near the Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there is another happy occasion: The House of the 21st Century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already talking with the city about a neighbourhood in Schweizer Garten.
The track plans a million-dollar winter crisis package
The road broke out a crisis plan to prevent trains from leaving during the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn publishes more than €70 million in the newspapers this year.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report with the appeal to the internal corporate plan, which is said to be calculated by 2015 in total with investments of around EUR 300 million.
It is said to make better use of trains and rail networks under extreme weather conditions.
It is said, among other things, that the number of internal and external employees is doubled to 16,000 people to remove snow from railway facilities and platforms.
The aim is to dispose of the platform until operation is started and 90 per cent for the operation of the necessary bends during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the road Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with government and industry officials against train failures and delays during this winter too.
In the past winter, the road in passenger transport had considerable problems because, among other things, there was a shortage of reserves under difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Railway Authority for years.
In addition, it allows delays in the repair of ICE trains
The track has also failed for years, that ICE train repairs must probably have to be checked more frequently when one ICE train took place at the Köln Main Station for the destruction of the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays a million fine in the United States
After the breakup of Chief Joseph Ackermann there are new tramps in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages there.
As if the problems at home were no longer enough, Deutsche Bank caught up with the U.S. defenses: Frankfurtian institutions are paying $145 million (€106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is a sale of mortgages.
The NCUA financial market regulator blames a number of large banks for misleading promises by cooperative banks to buy financial products; they may have reduced the risks.
Such papers have lost considerable value during the crisis and have thrown the bank into the abyss.
"We are pleased that we could solve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," said the spokesman Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank accepts no guilt by way of compensation.
That's also true for Citigroup, who committed to paying $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the cooperation of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is owned by cooperative banks in the United States and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for the billions of damages that have been incurred.
Now the completed settlement is the first of its kind.
The regulator also relied on other large banks and in the summer appealed to JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of doubtful mortgages, this is the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When an American bubble near the property in 2007, it became a number of financial firms fatal.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Even though the event took place a few years ago, it is now blowing the banks in the face of sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous actions to bring damages or to question them.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the biggest wave of charges.
It stands out to 18 international large banks that two state-owned US financiers dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's real estate in mortgage stores in the amount of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA lawsuit, here it is more shops at a total value of about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Authority shall require the Frankfurtian Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without, of course, indicating any precise amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claim as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
Buffett's financial guru is investing heavily in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, an important US investor, Warren Buffett, has always declared that he will not invest in IT and computers, because long-term development of companies will only be expected with difficulties.
But now he read IBM's business reports and changed his mind about investment in the industry.
He had already had to understand that IBM was primarily offering services and establishing computer systems for the IT-division of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is considered a match to the knight.
As a result, it may be called the matte root of IT IBM now "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett told CNBC that he had bought an IBM stock worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the biggest IBM shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett sagt that even IBM had not yet known anything about his engagement.
Praised the management, who has tried for the economic crisis even for proper returns.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been betting on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centres for a long time.
More than a 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting and powerful computers for companies.
Buffett's been avoiding tech companies until today.
They argue that they invest only in enterprises whose activities they also understand.
Instead, it reached Buffett after a freight railway, after a lubricant manufacturer or after a machine manufacturer.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 of his own subsidiaries also shares in a number of largeconcerns such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Municher Rück.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old master took over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and built it with wise investments one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost unshakable sense of making money brought him the nickname "Omaha Eagle" (Omaha Spectacular).
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's stock rose one percent before the storm started.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of over $220 billion on the stock exchange and is being held together with Apple and Microsoft as the world's most valuable technological enterprises.
In Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to get in.
The founder of Bill Gates is said to be his confidential friend.
Threat is tangible.
After the discovery of the "Buniaks in Zwickau", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The news even speaks of "bloody ideology", which is now alive again.
The killings of eight small-scale entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a legitimate extremist background.
This report was addressed in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concerns.
For many of the German Turks have returned to this place a fear which has long been considered dead: Since the heat attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with the right extreme background.
That there was still no doubt about it in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network reveals a range that has long been overlooked.
"Does he relive the bloody ideology?" sounded the headlines of the online edition of Turkish newspapers "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the news "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police agent of the Constitutional Protection Service and feared that German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish Municipality of Germany has reacted with caution: it remembered the weekend of demonstrations of silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate of Victims of Racial Violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, remembered the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkey recruitment agreement.
In happy colors was staged a common life - as a history of success.
As a box here is a newscast by several Turkish media outlets: "Germany's Gift to Fifty" is a title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the letter "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken to make this thoughtless connection impossible.
"It's starting to stink," sounds the headline of the column from Ahmet Külahci.
It stresses that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The most critical is discussed in the German internet forums the police process and its late success in the search.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
In this way, many perform at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity so superficially carried out here, the immigrants will have nothing but their own defence and weapons."
"That'll be the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarifying and appropriateness of punishing the entire network depends very strongly on internal peace in Germany," says Selen.
Which means, if internal peace in Germany is threatened, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
Photo of the burning site in Solingen is deeply drilled into the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it clear to the Turkish living here that there is a tangible threat to Germans and Germans that mistrust and retreat can result in right-wing violence
However, the assassinations on the Turkish side have made a greater sense of reciprocity.
Do Not Repeat Errors From the Past
At the time, the Turkish press was particularly critical of German policy failures following assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen sent a compassionate telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to join his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech at that time to calculate the charges the Turkish people here paid.
It's quite as if the value of a person is measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of Turkish media shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many German Turks in this state of law is expressed.
In addition to efforts to clarify and re-evaluate the right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandal Bank at Lake Zurich
Europe's most adventurous bank has no place in Italy or France, but Switzerland.
UBS has suffered from financial crisis almost bankrupt and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
Now some German has to compare it.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
After his loud departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would enter almost equally spectacular new employment: the president of the board of management of the Swiss Grand Bank of UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber welcomed the public, praised Switzerland, whether for its beauty and UBS for its new stability and made friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turning point."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was already in September that everything was going to be completely different.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and lost approximately EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, the respected banker, had to leave.
The president of the UBS Board has since also been burned - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has become known that since February 2012, Weber Bank has been able to advise.
And the Presidency of the Management Board will take over already in May - not until 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, rather a professor of economics and emissary banking, and he would certainly need time to work.
Then suddenly he assumes responsibility for the Bank's strategy, which just once proved that he deserves the title "Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe"
Because UBS is huge - until recently was the world's greatest asset manager - and it will lie down for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, will remain a proud Swiss bank spared.
It started out as a financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
An image of a quiet and solid but also clever asset manager combines with ambitious goals: it also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So UBS 2007 managed one side with $1.6 billion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she went as an investment bank into the league of the world's biggest banks.
That's what impressed me.
A former banker and later longtime banking professor at Zurich Hans Geiger says: "I always referred to my students at UBS as a model of a good bank."
"From today's perspective, man asks, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was obvious for the first time that something went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, chairman of the board, who has so far been regarded as a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The investment division of the bank has lost subprime-papers and had to write down billions.
In order to keep this from happening, UBS is a real capital increase of 13 billion francs.
That is why she has found real investors, but one that would have recently been covered by her nose: the transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and the Arab state fund, which was so discreet that man didn’t even know its name.
But it was just the first hit.
In April 2008 it developed worse.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, the president of the management board Marcel Opel, 2006 the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
A disaster followed in October 2008: UBS was standing in the face of its misinvestment in the financial crisis before collapse and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank purchased from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation placed six billion francs on a mandatory swap bond for which it could have become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks on its territory.
Finally, the balance sheet sum of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
"We couldn't save UBS one more time," says Bank Expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months now, UBS has surrendered to this in a tax dispute with America and has shown willingness to issue wealthy customers' data, which, as far as possible with the help of the bank, cut taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a refund of the illegal profits from these transactions, including the fines.
This has helped UBS to learn more or less openly that it has helped with tax cuts.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the patron saint of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it used to be.
The resignation of the head of the board of directors and the president of the board of directors followed.
And exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas within a few months: in investment banking because of poor speculation and in the management of assets to assist in tax cuts.
And just when it calmed down a little bit again, just when UBS thought it had recovered again, this unfortunate business interview came in: The only dealer lost EUR 1.7 billion before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: the risk management of investment banking is obviously still not working.
"The case of Adoboli has probably revealed that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and finanz professor of finance at the Institute of Finance at the University of Zürich.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that he does not control the risks."
At the same time, it was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had gone a long time ago to become guardians of the great assets of the world: no too many risks, so security for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic, the world collapsed again.
The vaults of the Swiss banks have become a symbol for insurmountable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for special quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits into a cliché of good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bit bigger.
The position is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Curish Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Lake Zurich, which is framed by snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rentals of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Clowning like Tiffany's will be found here among Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli's confectionery.
For centuries there are Swiss banks: from Nationalbank via Pallast der Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered by a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, before them stands a powerful leather chair, next to the bank logo a large direction to the "seif".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
However, this idea of the Swiss Bank is sometimes suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss Grand Banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
His name wouldn't want to read in the paper, he eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, with both big bank stores.
UBS is probably getting too big, it's finding out - especially in the investment banking industry, where the Angloosas have expanded.
Swiss probably don't have anything to say anymore.
"And if they do, they've adapted to the English ways."
Indeed, it was an English investment banking company that changed UBS to bring her first high profits and then a disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million-nation country fell asleep in the greatest rescue event in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to save large bank bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If they're talking to Swiss bankers, they see you in particular in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined the powerful group.
A bank had arisen, which had already been too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and was still growing.
At the same time, it was helped by the addition of the two different bank predecessors to UBS: one wealthy but sleepy bank in Zurich with difficulty in managing property and poorer, but internationally more involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came in favour of a lot of money with which they could spin a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this increase in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors, from 2001 to 2007.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Opel were a team of the future," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, the person who manages the feelings around the stomach, who from banking science has developed completely up."
But Ospel said he relied on Wuffli to the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "I thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Pride was preceded by a fall.
Employees of UBS clearly remember the performances of leading workers, on which Group Chief Wuffli repeated the same password all the time: Beat Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She listed "League Tables", a sequencer that documented the success of banks at that time.
In it, UBS was trying to put it all the way up there.
Several steps have already taken her.
In the exchange of foreign exchange and stock exchange, she took part in the game at the top.
However, business advisors who were entrusted stress one weakness: in the international interest trade, in the words of the bankers "Fixed Income", there may be a large gap behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, the UBS decided to adventure, which almost cost it its existence.
Hunger after growth, both the bank itself and its established risk fund were invested in US investments by Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that repacked securities into American mortgage loans and passed on - but also kept the risks himself.
Also, when the other banks were looking for a way out.
"It's the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, there UBS bought," says Bank Expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, so deep down.
One manager had to go after another when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
The UBS positions have become a catapult seat and have been swinging so far.
Whoever runs the Grand Bank now has almost incapacitated work.
He must find a strategy for a bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Bank expert Geiger already has an idea: End of investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet) yet.
But investment banking is supposed to be hard hit, so it's clear now.
Next Thursday, the new head of Sergio Ermotti Bank wants to present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen only as a transitional solution when the bank suddenly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has long-term business management of UBS, reported the Curish bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to reinstate the investment bank in the mid-1990s.
3,500 places to go.
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money for?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But the public only says so far that his lady will first find her apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs the stock exchange in the United States.
The threatening recession in Europe has rid the American investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended impact.
The reduced production of the Continent industry suffocated hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the embryo.
General facilitation by the exchange of government in Rome and Athens
The euro has fallen towards the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass in the past week was considered as still half full, not half empty - but now they penetrated the front again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First and foremost, financial values were on sales tickets.
The Dow-Jones Standard Value Index recorded a decrease of 0.6 per cent to end trading at 12.078 points.
During the course of the trading, the mayor of the market barometer was between 12.027 and 12.170 points.

Nasdaq's technological stock index lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt Dax said goodbye to 1.2 percent of 5985 readers.
Industry in 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the wave.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
"We're not an island, we're not dependent," said Steve Goldman in management Goldman.
Europe may not recover so quickly from recession, and there are additional signs of bank weakness.
The investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this view: He said in a CNBC-interview that it is probably not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too soon for him to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the U.S. technology industry for decades.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM increased the share rate of the traditional company and left it against the trend during the trading process at the outset to weave by almost one percent higher.
The paper ended almost unchanged $187.35.
Buffett paid an average of $170 per piece based on his own data, and now he's holding 5.5 percent.
The stock exchange of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares dropped by 2.6 percent clearly stronger than the market.
The house is set up to finance almost the rest of its shares at China Construction Bank and it receives $6.6 billion for it.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, there are floodgates in the field as "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be drained from the cities, says experts.
Some like them, others like to get rid of them quite quickly: The crows belong to the city’s image for centuries, yet in some municipalities the complaints of impurity and noise caused by the animals.
However, there is no way against "problem birds" so far in sight.
I don't think the field crows can be drained from the cities anymore, they told the experts at the first symposia about the crows in East Africa's Leera.
There experts from all over the Federal territory consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservation also brought problems to cities from exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is about to destroy the traditional areas of life in an increasing way.
Persecution, growing building and planting typical trees to nest for birds make life difficult.
The crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are in the Western Soest, in the northwest, including Jever, Diepholze and Achimu in Bram and Leer.
There, a controversial project of mass killing of crows in the rural district caused a negative headline.
Critics have marked the capture of animals into traps for birds and slaughtering cages as particularly brutal.
"Normal exile, scarring, nothing brings," so much has been discovered by urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer.
The removal of nests by spraying water or cutting trees often has adverse consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals retreat, the large colonies peel and divide into other places."
Repulsion is only thought to be an exception for hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be addressed, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is thoughtable to combine the expulsion of animals from sensitive residential areas and attract them to settle in other places.
"Informing tables instead of chain saws" was promoted by a psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, for a completely different treatment of animals: "One of the throwbacks in the face can finally stop our confidence."
Mrs Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's science trail, on which they provide information boards of instruction on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
In the meantime, the project has already been received by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the sound of a bird's caused by Mrs Jürgens, she had her own opinion: "Here's every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
Animal intelligence and skill are legendary: Field Havens do not use only a tool to reach a pamphlet, but even as an aid they will make their tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested behavior on four field ravens, how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that they must bring the stones to the wreckage to get to the larvae of the pier.
Without great training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have in order to cause the collapse of the platform.
In the second attempt, the lubricated crows had to solve a more viscous problem.
In a vertical battle, researchers placed a small container with a laurel of molars.
The birds could not reach their prey with their tail.
However, researchers put pieces of wire in them.
Of these, all four animals formed hooks, which she used to hunt from the tube to hold the container.
Three of the four field ravens even managed with a plug.
Cristiano Ronaldo Shoots Portugal to Europe Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks didn't go out.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland take part in the 2012 European Championship.

At Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal was set in motion.
Ronaldo was soon led by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
At a good quarter an hour later, Nani demonstrated his quality in shooting at a large distance, and he adjusted from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who didn't make it in the first half hour, had their first clear chance at the goalkeeper Edina Djek.
The former Wolfsburu player from English at the head of the table of the Standing Club Manchester City settled with the head ball on the bottom edge of the brown, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek Skin for Czech Republic
Finally, he stood in the centre of the Wolfgang Stark referee from Ergading.
Following proceedings against Heller Postig in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbeh and granted Portugal a yellow card. (36.)
On the counter, Stark carried out a controversial criminal kick after action Fabio Coentraa, who changed the Misimovic with certainty.
But after a break, the European Deputy Minister of 2004 clarified everything with four strikes.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek finished his final doubts in 81 minutes.
This leaves the 1976 European champion after the fifth in a row at the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilk’s husband, with the legionaire of Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Norimberk), was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial phase.
Tanker Petr Čech prevented the possible own goaltender, Tomáš Sivok, at the last moment (9).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunity when duo Stephen Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired at the turn of the criminal territory at 40 minutes just outside of Chechov's gate.
After the break, it must have saved the place of the already defeated goalner of the Czech World Class, once again reduced the attacker FC Soul (50).
Branka finally explained everything.
Turkey missed the football miracle from Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul Turkey did not exceed 0:0 in Zagreb.
While National Coach Guus Hiddink is almost confident of his position on World Cup 3 in 2002 he must relax, the Croatians can enjoy their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
31,000 spectators at Maksimiro Stadium should experience almost a fairy tale start.
Selcuk Inan struck in seven minutes with only a pole shot from a distance, and the attacker Kazim also could not hang the reflected ball in the goalie.
After this terrible second, Croatia was taking over, but still more and more control.
They didn't get the goal after they interrupted the Crowds.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who was released from the 62nd minute of the Dortmund Ivan Perisice, were also legionaries from the Danish Federal League (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni is going to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish were the first to participate in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who took care of the 4-0 success in the first match for the preliminary decision, at the 32st minute in the lead.
Constantine Vassiliev (57th) evened for the guests.
Ireland had set its pace from the beginning, but it had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last minute did the Estonian defense prevent a possible goalkeeper.
At 32 minutes, though, it was quite far away.
After the failed defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londaka was on site and pushed the ball over the line to state 1:0.

Personal Massacre
Emotionally strong new book by Peter Englund named Beauty and Grief: Confidential History of World War I (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with a long list of performers until your head turns.
One advice on how to behave at that moment: Carefully tear this page out and make a bookmark out of it.
You will be very familiar with all people in Mr Englund's novel narrative and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a lighthouse - in moments when you will feel confused and lost in various situations, just like men and women in the story.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards Nobel Prize for literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite at best, as an "antihistory work".
It contains several very familiar names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, almost lacking ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book about what happened, the author explains, rather, "book about what it was like." He deals mainly with "feelings, perceptions, experiences and moods."
"Beautiful and saddening" combines the war experiences of 20 fewer dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives crumble like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the complexion of fate while others are put out.
The book of Mr. Englund differs from the classic historical novels.
It governs the idea that the first world war was just about the terrible trenches on the Western front.
"Beautiful and saddening" has been looking into other places where war dramas were taking place: Alps, Balkans, Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with falling bees' nests, having to spend Christmas in the shade of pyramids or facing the presence of much tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning, it's a very touching reading.
War will consume people's lives as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling gunpowder.
When he starts talking about gunfire in the distance, and you're the woman who's at home with her kids, run away or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, even why the whole war has been waged.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," said Mr. Englund, "was filled with speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beautiful and sad" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are all taken from biographies, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound horrifying and seductive, but the inclusion of small moments and details makes them absolutely alive and credible.
Many of them discuss hunger and cope with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Refugees, all the substitutes."
"Coffee of coffee, like aluminium, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "mase made from pressed rice cooked in sheep's fat (and supplemented with fake bone from wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, boots with wooden soles".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the manufacture of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds inner impulses for savagery and brutality in him, saying of war, "At last you will understand that this is human nature, not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskys, evening newspapers or a good book, pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbar in the interior behind that scratched me."
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and that no one will even notice it, let alone grieve.
"When a person finally accepts the sacrifice, he would at least expect it to happen in the sight of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like "a convict who's secretly hanged".
Further comments relate to the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition and a competitive fight," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He picked up what he calls "the new kind of beast of the emerging century: a eloquent and ideologically-acquired mass murderer in the dress cut to a degree that makes his bloodthirsty without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, and vileness turns with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes the soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some sexual illness from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the business of gonorrhea, which the soldiers bought and abused with genitalia in the hope that they would end up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate of them were to wipe it in their eyes, which often blinded them to the rest of their lives."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's yarn is fresh, but it doesn't show, which fits perfectly with his human subject.
In dozens of minor outputs, it captures the way in which the war "spoiled an uncontrollable force: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books of World War I usually worked with signs, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussella or novels as "The Western Front of Peace" by Eric Maria Remarquea.
Mr. Englund prefers non-conventional concepts.
His book has the most crushing conclusion, which in popular scientific literature does not have parallels.
But I won't let you know.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page out of the list of heroes out of his hand and burned it.
After the previous mistake this time per minute exactly scheduled event
She was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night of Monday on Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty at the time.
No one knew about the action except a few high-ranking officers, and the others were told first that it was a drill.
In front of the action was police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence stressed how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
They could not repeat the cases of the past weeks when, for example, pepper sprays against demonstrators have been used, thereby violating the departmental rules and, in addition, the wave of sympathy for the public has shifted to the side of the squatters.
Therefore, a police operation aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park from demonstrators was launched after two weeks of careful planning and training.
Leaders have been inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
A massive exercise in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island section, which was prepared for action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have strengthened the so-called training for the suppression of unrest - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - focusing on the city's Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training was held on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" someone who was originally explained by action only as "practice".
"I know a few police officers who were also called to this event, and no one has definitely told them that they are going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that he would remain anonymous.
"On going to Zuccotti Park, they knew only the highest status of the department members."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already received.
On October 14, city officials were scheduled to clean up the park, but then resigned from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard of it, they recorded them before the operation started in the park for hundreds of years.
Tuesday's events were attended by police officers from different units, including intervention groups from all around - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr Kelly explained that during the day he came to the park and was leaving a large number of people, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when there would be as many people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the troops left, they lined up on the border streets of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge bridge, freight cars of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The lights and recorded news of amplions scared many demonstrators.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say that until 1:45 a.m., there wasn't a single tent that wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack their things.
Other police teams were seen gathering at the edge of the park to get inside if any arrests were to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Chief Police Officer Paul J. Browne claimed that this was for their own safety.
Many journalists, however, believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and some policemen were rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street headed along the western border of the park could have been filmed without a problem.
The police proceeded in the western direction, and a thick bar of personal protestors, including luggage and Igelite bags full of clothing, followed by teams from the Hygiene Department, who immediately collected everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were pulled out of the park, documenting images appeared shortly later on the Internet.
The most remarkable group of demonstrators fled to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some have created a barrier and the police have initiated a methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people tied to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Members of the emergency services were called to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 in the morning, there was no arrest in the park, Mr Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, it sounded like a police statement.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were detained in the park.
The majority of the arrests took place because of "organization of riots and opposition during the arrest," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, the highest-ranking uniform officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives' department, also participated personally.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "didn't share the control of the operation," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, there were roadblocks.
From these places the police developed a protective belt even further away from Zuccotti Park.
In one place police officers were spotted, many of whom were shielded, as they pushed people further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., a protestor south of Pine Street was spotted jumping up onto a police car hood, and several others were blowing air out of police van tires.
At one point, a bunch of overcrowds flew out of the crowd.
One police officer and one protestor were hospitalized at the end of the operation.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for release
Committees representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that discharge was not necessary and in addition it was discrimination due to the disproportionate impact on schools that poor students attend.
The Court of Justice is probably the last option left to the District Council 37s in their attempt to reverse the release decision.
On the seventh October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other staff members who were among the worst paid city employees lost their job. Their release was described as the city's payoff for not having allowed him access to the health care fund last spring to the managed workbooks by which the city wanted to put a hole in the budget.
City officials have categorically rejected this charge.
At a meeting of the City Council held last month, Minister of Education Dennis M. Waltcott said that discharge was part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the board immediately insisted that there was no specific reference in the budget to the release of auxiliary workers.
Representatives of the District Council of 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday they will convene a press conference where they will formally announce the action before the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the complainant will be the first to be eight released workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, the spokesman for the city's legal department, said that the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, and that is why he will not speak to the individual charges.
According to the proposal for a complaint that the New York Times was able to obtain, the trade unions focused on the number of people released in poor parts of the city, which they wanted to support their allegations of unfair conduct, and they argue that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funding.
They point out that while the schools in Staten Island did not open up at all and in the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, there were 17 school assistants and in District 8 and 9 in South Bronx, 46 assistants were released.
He recalls that five of the eight assistants have lost their jobs at Public School 36 in Harlem, although it is a school where 68 percent of the students live in poverty. The lawsuit says, "It's not a neighborhood full of fat parents who can provide money to settle the deficit in the budget."
The budget of Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way the bonus funding was calculated for each registered poor student.
The Committees argue, among other things, that the school principals could have been confused in the manner in which a document approving the release of parental coordinators was written.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is more often used to describe the movement of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Six parent coordinators have been released," says the complaint motion, "and not just moved to the database at the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya.
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to have a bearing on the uprising in Libya.
Before that occurred, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States forces ceased.
On Tuesday, the Commission for International Relations of the Senate will decide on the statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass) together with Senators John McCain (Aris) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn), in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thank the US troops for their "statehood".
"We want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who began to rebuild their country with this statement," Kerry said.
"Both parties to the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate concerning Libya has yet been easy.
During the summer, legislators from both sides kept arguing with the White House about the text of a series of declarations of approval or, on the contrary, rejection of the United States military role in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differences between the political parties, so it was never voted out in the Senate.
However, the same day that the House rejected the proposal, the Chamber rejected measures to stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
In this way the American mission in Libya was literally in the legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but apparently its members did not so much to stop supporting it in its efforts.
The weight of the congress finally preceded other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August, and on 20 October he was killed by Gaddafi.
Mission NATO officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations, in its statement " congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and the admirable tenacity they have spent trying to free their people" and "thanks the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for the extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be redistributed into two-half, as was the case in approving the June proposal?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican side of the Commission, stood against the last version.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
In the House this week, it will vote in favour of an addition to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution concerning the budget or other subject to which the entire House or Senate will vote.
Other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of the 68 additions to the constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are just minor changes of others.
Only in the House can there be at least 15 versions of the supplement on a balanced budget and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their advocates - especially the starting republicans, who want to improve their reputations - can boast of their "authority".
The revenue on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required the Assembly and the Senate to vote on the supplement relating to the balanced budget.
In March 58, the senators voted in favour of the non-binding declaration to support the creation of such an addendum.
In addition to the budget, several members would also like to discuss a limited number of periods in which Congress members could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that can be President-in-Office.
Vice-President Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) has offered a number of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an additive prohibiting the marriage of couples of the same sex, as well as an additive prohibiting the burning of state flags.
Some legislators also want to allow for the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of the states oppose them.
Although the members of Congress seem to be very active in designing various additions, they do not appear to be significantly out of diameter compared to previous years.
At 111, the Congress was offered 77 additions, while at 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activities were even pale compared to the early 1990 ’ s, when according to statistics, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last addition that was added - the 27th supplement - was ratified in 1992, but in fact the Congress was proposed in 1789.
"Broken, but not defeated," says Gifford in her first television conversation since the shooting.
Ten months after a public meeting with the voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Aris) appeared on a national television on Monday evening, she sang with a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that more than a return to Congress was worth it.
Giffords appeared on the "20/20" show at ABC News Station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that making the sentences still makes her trouble and she needed help walking.
The whole show documented her difficult reconvalescence, which was necessary due to a bullet wound that pierced her skull in the front, penetrated her left half of her brain, and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
During her first television interview with the ice shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, smiled and sang - while she described her recovery as "obsessive".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she answered one-four-year-old Giffords, " Pretty good."
The conversation with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special "20/20" series, which was broadcast in advance of the release of the new book of this couple, entitled "Gabbas: Story of Courage and Hope".
The Special's been tracking the entire recovery of Gifford since the shooting on January 8th.
The videos that Kelly filmed during the first week show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across his forehead.
While her husband encourages her, he can't do more at that time than just lift one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teaching her how to do simple activities.
Chewing your head.
Rinse.
And then, her first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "tast" when she demanded changes in her breakfast.
Videos by the ABC station show that Giffords played music for a major recovery role: Congresswoman on them sings together with a therapist on the melody to the songs "Girls Just Want Have Fun" by Cindy Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day in therapy, Sawyer told her she doesn't remember anything from the day the shooting took place.
Her husband said that Gifford had read the news articles on the shooting until March 12th, when she first asked him who was the six who were killed in the incident.
From the shooting is the suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a prison in Mississippi, where he waits for trial under the influence of violent medications.
"Many people have died," said Giffords to Sawyer.
"The terrible, the terrible, the terrible."
Kelly Sawyer told him that at one point his wife, during the recovery, said, "I lost."
"So I said to her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You're the only one who got the hang of it.
But you can do it, you can get back together and come back stronger than ever."
Military units meet compassion rather than respect
That event was a Wall Street gala party that made millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, fliers and marines ran around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd rose up and gasped.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who held a spring benefit.
On the evening of the celebration, the then chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff took part. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was also on the spot, but he saw the role of military units somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as some orphan," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect, it was pity.
So completely different impressions just illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is implicitly involved in praise for its victims.
But these praises cost something, they say soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if the individuals in the uniform were sorry.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"Although it seems that the only way some of us can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relationships with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face was much worse when they returned from Vietnam.
As a result, most of the words about regret are spoken in silence and privacy among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat operations, where they served as Marine Corpsmen, their father warned them that outside the army would look at their services from two angles.
From the standpoint of some, they will feel respect and awe because they have defeated the enemy insurgents and have visited exotic places.
But another will be spinning his head if "there is no evil, violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and returned to take up his place in Washington in government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who were interviewing him were inconceivably suggesting whether he could cope with the stress associated with his work in Washington soon after returning to battle.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
Concerned army in part by the American indifference to war.
Successes in the battlefield will rarely reap recognition in the country, which has little awareness of its own army, and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only finds little of its own benefit.
"As a nation we no longer appreciate military heroism as was common in World War II," declared Lieutenant General David Barno, who led American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are credited with the number of events they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to hit hard against rape.
This week will decide whether the trial of 28 women and men against the army will be initiated due to alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other applicants are prepared to file the action.
The first-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was reportedly raped by her army colleague for 25 years and was pregnant at 11 weeks.
It happened in October 2008 and she headed to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, so she could have a little drink in her room.
"I had a warning light in my head," Lyman described.
But Texasan's mother-in-law completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"She's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that only a few minutes after they went into her room, the man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, 18 November, Lymanová and 27 other existing or former members of the army will wait for the verdict of a hearing that might have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will go on whether the charges against the former minister of defense Robert Gates and his predecessors, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The charges state that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by the Washington lawyer Susan Burke and the prosecution party had 17 members at the time. However, in the coming months their number increased to 28-25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed to investigate, punish and prosecute any attacks.
Burke says he's going after the highest-ranking army commanders because the problem starts with them.
"Armada is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent the imposition of measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than group all the charges in this case - she has put all the eggs into one basket, as she says - she will file lawsuits in a number of different cases if it is necessary that the pressure does not rise.
The defence defence team is headed by US Attorney Neil MacBride, who, together with his co-workers, has launched an appeal to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents that Newsweek has acquired are detailed in the strategy of defending - in principle, that current or former soldiers cannot sue for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under the 1950 Supreme Court regulation, called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries concern the military services of complainants," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in the fight, it is just a saying: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women's soldiers played an increasingly significant role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two-thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time to modernize the army, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, except for her case involving three other legal representatives.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the Veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit for the four main military academy for the alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
Independently, the non-profit organization of the U.S. Vietnamese veterans gathers evidence for its lawsuit against the army. This action focuses on the diagnosis of "personal miscarriage" allegedly found in victims of rape, so that the army has an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a very common practice.
In December, her group filed a complaint against a state organization for dealing with veterans accused of discriminatory practices, which should have occurred in processing requests for assistance from those who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were presented by a group of Senators and Members from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases and, according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents that occurred in that year.
A report issued in March also discusses the level of criminal prosecution of suspects: 20 per cent of the cases reported in the military came to trial in 2010 - half against the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of a series of traumas.
For example, the first-class soldier Lyman reported alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to eleven different members of the police, doctors, and commanders.
All the tests required to determine the rape, and the blood of the attacker was found in her bed, from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing in which she was asked questions as to whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify about the reputation of the alleged offender, who was finally exonerated.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," says Lyman.
"I had the feeling that I was going to have a baby right there - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't his trial, he was mine."
The Lymans ordered the visit of a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her personality disorder, calling her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without claim of service.
Whether the Lyman case and the other prosecutors move to another stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law University.
Of course, it notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to other stages of discussion."
However, between them and the verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment that the light of the world saw.
I'm the life-time critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because their duties do not follow the same level of motivation and deterrence.
He adds: "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Only when good people are willing to fight will change.
If the hearing does not decide in their favour, Burkevoyá, the complainant's lawyer, gathers hundreds of other persons ready to file a complaint and starts working on other cases relating to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to July’s murderous rage, which left 77 dead in Norway, took part in his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik was able to act alone, he was not alone in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack, he spent a lot of time with the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right-wing group on social networks websites.
After the tragedy of this year, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how do I find them?
Easy, enough to go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting to them is not really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report by the British research team on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that scientists have been able to easily use advertising on the website and, thanks to this, have determined with complete accuracy the search for a demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Throughout Europe, the Bartlett team has found half a million right-wing fans, focusing on them and sending out ads to them, but instead of calling them into a newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they have called them to fill out a questionnaire asking questions about the level of their education, the relationship to violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It is a completely new way of carrying out research," notes Bartlett.
Some of the results are not as surprising: online right-wing supporters are all young men, who promote a growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the screen of the computer."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends, which include state updates, contributions to the walls and "I like them" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them will provide on average three different data on a daily basis, making this social network literally "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic work in which the word Facebook appears has risen to almost 800% over five years ago.
For some scientists, Facebook's magic is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It used to be true that when you wanted to do research among the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the side where you'd never be let go," Bartlett says.
"This whole Facebook thing is breaking down - you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify the social-health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who were discussing their drunken performances on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about the subject.
Moren suggests that the peers of the students’ pages monitor and come with a offer of help to a student who publishes too much drunken status.
"The problem cannot be solved unless you can diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Morena and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development at the Child Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify the children at risk that we would not have a chance to discover otherwise."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The information team of the website has developed statistics on the relationship between the status relationship and the date of St. Valentine's Day, the electoral participation in 2010 and the coefficient of satisfaction of the nation (mainly by using information they have had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the website should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the website is watching whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, you need to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most of the users could even think that scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in London Knowleddge Lab, about a study from 2006, which he conducted using the public facebook walls of his students.
"If it was about them, they took it so that the information was just between them and their friends."
Subsequently, it is also important to consider the question of methodology.
Even in the off-line research, there is no guarantee that the entity is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much information on the profile and contributions on the walls are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook continue to be the best possible tool to be used in research.
"If you go into the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities still happen off-line."
"Smooth and non-human": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public court hearing
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to the two attacks, during which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, during his first public court hearing in Oslo described himself as a fighter of "battles".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian Templar Knights," said the court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the court because the mandate has given you organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my deeds, but I do not plead guilty to them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted this monologue because "he did not give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could make his views known."
For the same reason, he refused to address Breivik, who brought with him a prepared speech, at the end of the hearing, his relatives.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, to prohibit any contact with the media for 4 weeks and to announce that the authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 related victims and survivors.
Some came in hopes that they would be able to look Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he was held firmly under the castle.
They all took part in an effort to move the case to early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors said to the NRK commentator.
"It wasn't a pleasant thing, but I can tell for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally moved back a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When coming and going to the building without any difficulty looking at the present Journalists and surviving into the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he was part of a larger resistance movement, the judge said that he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any accomplice.
For some, it may be comforting to know that the attacks of June 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish she would look like a monster, but it's not," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, everything would be a lot easier."
7 lessons from the lost conversation with Steve Jobs in the movie heading to the movies this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear - and elected him as his genius the greatest modern inventor.
In a recently reopened Job’s interview, which was held for a special film that goes to the movies this week, Apple’s fans will find that its creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and the workflows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who fits every detail - believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "thinks that a really great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] between a great idea and an excellent result product is still a long way out of work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on a TV show called Triumf Computer Crazy, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the shooting, there was a unique, more than an hourly conversation.
At that time, ten years after Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, he had full hands to work with his new computer company, NeXT, and he looked impatiently at how the general public would receive the internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely's entire interview was used on TV and the original copies of the interview were reported to have been lost during transport.
Shortly after Job’s death, however, VHS found copies in the director’s garage.
This material, slightly cut, forms the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which goes to the selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has heard of his distaste for longer conversations, Jobs is very excited to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds to think when you see how Job’s answer perfectly contemplated to make it as simple and as accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism occurs on the surface, where Cringely’s questions are impatient and move him to get to more important problems and issues more quickly.
The conversation was filmed before the Pixar, iPod, or iPhone era and there are horrendous prophetic thoughts in it when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to debate the postmortem evaluation of Job's career, but on Jobs, which we see here as a eager dream in the bloom of his genius, there's something raw and inspiring.
He's got his own vision of how things could and should look.
It didn’t take long, and after he made his point, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"In the years of business, I always asked myself, "Why do you do this?" and the answer was always the same: "Well, that's just how you do it."
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks about business things in depth.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing its efforts to simplify accounting in Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - often started with the inscription "standard costs", the amount of which he could only imagine. At that point he decided to go his own way - developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine business costs during the moment.
As he did the rosary on the Pope:
Jobs remembers the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to effectively hack into a phone company and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
A number of things have been written about the device in the past, but Job’s enthusiasm when the Blue Box describes it as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
They explain how the device was tested with Wozniak using a paid phone and were connected from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times we've been this way around the world, so when we yelled something into the pay phone, it came back a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we found that we could build a thing ourselves that is able to manage the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
We made ourselves a little thing that could control a much larger giant -- it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would ever take it without it.
Jobs continues with a description of the joke that nearly reached the end with Wozniak. By means of the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could speak to the Pope, with Henry Kissinger as best they appeared.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called to speak to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the pope himself was raised to the telephone, the couple cheered up and put the headphone on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12, looking for spare parts to build a chemometer, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone number and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it formed my view of what this company is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited a company research laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made".
He was big as a trunk, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right away.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher in HP, hung around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How he invents innovation:
In several places, Jobs during the interview discusses how they come up with new products for the run.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a few boards with general connections, one customer asked him to build a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 days paid at his disposal, during which he had to invent, mount and add finished equipment.
When he was in Apple later, he remembers the problems they faced in developing the computer mouse:
"I remember when we were kind of arguing... screaming at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300], when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big a company breathes:
A long time before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs prudently predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision would cycle and lose their market share.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're making better copies or printeries, well, what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At that point, there's a lot of waste and marketing going on, so companies are run by people who are in charge of this, while people who are in charge of their own products are evicted from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led society to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could own literally the entire computer industry.
It could've been ten times as big as it is, it could've been Microsoft for the 1990s...
But instead of winning, they lost.
How he takes innovation as an art form:
"An excellent idea and an excellent result product is a long way to go and a lot of work... and how this great idea develops and changes and grows."
During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.
You have to come up with a number of compromises - certain things simply electrons, glass, robots or factories you won't force to do.
You must keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
After all, it depends on taste - you try to think about the best things mankind has ever created, and in a way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists are copying, but the best artists are stealing.
I've never been ashamed to rob the best ideas.
The Macintosh company was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and by coincidence also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they could do amazing things in entirely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with the opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was dealt with by the court
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether it would accept an objection to the law on the medical care of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a ceremony sponsored by a law firm who would be present before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges gathered to discuss the proposals submitted.
One of the cases under discussion was the lawsuit brought by 26 states questioning the radical reprocessing of the medical care that Congress approved last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed that they would hear the action, but in March, the five-hour hearings are expected, the result of which will further develop the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full force at the time the decision is issued.
The lawyer who stands before the court and tries to achieve the denial of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General under the rule of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been working on defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court hearing on the case.
She attended, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and confirmed opposition to the Health Care Act.
And the introduction of the guests?
This is nothing new: these two judges have been participating in the Federalist Society's events for years.
And it's certainly nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to abide by the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
However, if it were not, their conduct would certainly be governed by principle C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are directly linked and other organisations are organising for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor be referred to as an action programme."
However, the relationship of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms active in the case, as well as to companies with a huge financial interest in this case, was richly sufficient to penalise government-calling activists.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules that applies to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dinnered on social benefits together with legal representatives waiting to discuss their case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines the legs with all allegations of non-prejudiciousness, which is unacceptable.
To their critics, Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding and showed them that they also have no problem combining their legal obligations with actions by groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a highly built conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly that of Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kaganová worked as a general prosecutor under President Obama's rule when the first objections against the law appeared before the court.
Kagan's critics are pushing her to deny her involvement in the case, and she claims that she was fighting as hard as she could now be unbiased.
Kegan didn't say she was going to resign.
Boeing received a record contract for jet aircraft worth USD 18 billion
Emirates Airlines order 50 two-way Boeing 777 jets with a purchase option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is a Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer, and the price of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, it is something else.
Similarly, the important report is where Boeing obtained the contract: the Middle East, the growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order in history on the weekend, relating to the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-way stream Boeings 777.
Sensing contract came from Emirates resident in Dubai.
Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Air Show reported that airlines had the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, which would result in a total contract value of USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the Oman Air airlines had ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which boast a significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the whole Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many of the airlines in the Middle East belong to the more difficult nations.
This means that they have not only money to pay for aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - it is not so decisive because the country itself is making a profit at higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to an increase in fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The contract from the Emirates strengthens Boeaing’s leading position on the large hulled aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to the narrowest companies, which wanted to attempt to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of the 777-300ER aircraft, will take place.
The withdrawal occurred because customers demanded more useful loads of the aircraft and flight, so it took time for the manufacturer to give the machines more power to the engine.
Boeing Co's share price increased by 1.5% to USD 67.94.
Mexican President's sister appears to have been defeated in the Michoacan elections.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was helped in the pursuit of the governor's chair by drug dealers.
The sister Felipe Calderon appeared to have lost her post in the violent state elections for the governor in Michoacán. On Monday, she stated that one of her opponents helped to win the drug dealership.
Preliminary results condemned the leadership of the Western State Governorate's Elections to Faust Valle by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"In particular, until yesterday the election itself is alarming not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," Luis Maria Calderon said in an interview for the radio the day after Sunday's elections.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the polling group... entertained the polls, built roadblocks... and let people vote on the PRI order.
The PRI Party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
However, it plans a quick return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI Party hopes to win in July in the presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led the day before the elections, only very closely.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative side of her brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Valleyon as a winner.
Third, Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-hand side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which has so far ruled by the Governor's Office. For a divisive and sadly persecuted party, the 2012 presidential election is a very unfortunate failure.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and encourages other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the birthplace of President Calderon and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
However, violence persisted.
The mayor of PAN, Louisa Marie Calderon's nephew, was murdered only a week before the elections and many candidates out of fear resigned.
However, whatever the results of the elections in Michoacan look like for the PRI side, the party's victory will help to gain a new impulse.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Valley and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save Eurozone
The Bank of Asia Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help save the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of the Asian economy as well.
Rajat Nag, CEO of ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the countries of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European difficulties "too unconcerned" and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and resources would help to overwhelm the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is fit," said the Financial Times during the World Economic Forum interview in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested for a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days the borrowing costs of Italy have risen dangerously, and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe raised concerns that the global economy could pull back into recession, and calls began to arise to unite and help the euro area to find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds from the Fund by the European Union, would provide more negotiating opportunities for the Asian partners of the European countries.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drain on foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task, and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as those in India, have nothing to do with helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, U.S.A., said it would be very difficult politically to explain aid for Europe to 1.2 billion Indians when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
"One could find out that the Greeks are retired in their 50s and they're enjoying vacations on the beaches, which might be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is threatening "a dangerous domain effect".
The Bank's forecast that in Asia, between 2011/2012, 7.5% of economic growth is now facing "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable emerging markets must create "unforeseen spending plans" to protect them from a decline and a significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon on possible defensive cuts
On Monday, the Minister of Defence Leon Panetta placed himself under a boiler in Congress when he warned that the rising automatic cuts in the budget could endanger national security and trigger a financial chain response beginning in Pentagon and continuing over the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian installation lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend $450 billion in this way over the next ten years, but now it is worried about a further $600 billion reduction if the Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress's inability to reach an agreement on the budget will result in a 23% flat-rate downturn and many new projects being put in place.
"Because of this huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy just three quarters of the building or ship. Moreover, there could be serious damage to other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civil servants, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also have to send civilians almost certainly on forced vacation to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care for our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, they'll touch the battle units as well, announces Panetta.
"Although the accounts for the financing of potential war operations in the overseas will not be directly affected, those operations will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contractual personnel, which will result in delays in the agreed contracts supporting the military efforts of our people."
"The conditions of paid staff will be reduced, which will also delay payments to suppliers and subsequent infringements of legal and political support."
Both Senators of Pant's wrote down ten days ago and asked for details regarding the possible impact on automatic strands at the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the coup d'état at the Ministry of Defence could result in a rapid deterioration of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this tough measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Pant's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It is yet to be seen whether Panett's letter and fresh warning will raise the pressure on Congress approving the budget and strengthen the voices calling for the pentagon to be omitted from the list of stricken areas.
The pantata has recently been in talks about possible cracks more and more openly, although he himself has moved to his high position in the Pentagon with years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that he was letting himself into a stiff fight.
At a press conference held for a minute, the defence minister indicated a brief picture of what his resort could expect - a shell of an army that would, however, lack a core inside.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammo."
"It'll be an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of a speech in the Pentagon.
"It will be a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to deal with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the annex added with the letter to McCain and Graham's Penta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "extensive operational risks: late reactions to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibility of planting and planting around the world; anticipated unacceptable risks in future combat operations."
In addition, the Panel added that some of the biggest defence projects could be expected to end, including those already tested, even those only in the early stages of planning.
For example, the F35 aircraft project, the planned new bomber, the ballistic submarines of the new generation, the new coastal battleship, and the new ground vehicle to which the army and the Marine Corps wanted to replace the humvee.
By halting further development and testing the F35 aircraft, $80 billion would be saved over the next 10 years, but its advocates argue that it is a necessary further step in improving the army that needs to be addressed by China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
The summer view of recent headlines tells us how serious and everywhere lies and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has full hands on the charge that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim that the other lies.
Managers at Penn State University were charged with false testimony when they tried to hide records that a retired football coach had sexually assaulted a boy.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling American President Barrack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy all careers and incur stability in many countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately thrown away by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using his campaign to try to hide his unmarried affair.
And no one ever forgets the media circus that broke up around Bill Clinton when he lied in the second period in the function of his sexual intrusion with Monica Levinsky.
It's all about cheating at school and at university.
There are instances in which teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their opinions.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and deception is acceptable.
How many frauds are we dealing with?
Studies show you're going to lie somewhere between 10 and 200 in one day.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first encounter in life.
Determining lies, or "recognizing lies", is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, to Sharada, when a person shouts, "I have you." The identification of deception is a serious science industry working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that most of the old myths about lying were thrown away.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're messing around, cocktails, blushing or cheating.
However, do not come out of being difficult to spot and expose liars.
A trained lie-identifier can tell the truth from the eternal construction, minor facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from an extensive and evolving sector regarding the recognition of lies, and it is clear that exposure to deception is a modern skill that can be learned easily and can help you in today's complex world - especially if your work responsibilities include hiring, organising interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them flush out in alertness, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men carry more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "targeted" - mostly in order to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than free people (all the lies they say are "indulgent").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
Watch the body's normal behavior first.
It's called initial observation.
He's going to make a later finding out what he's comparing to.
Note the holding of the body of the subject, its laughter, working with the voice.
You should know if someone constantly knocks their feet so that you don't wrongly accuse him of lying just because he starts knocking his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to determine the noises of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
However, consider this merely as warning signals, not as evidence of a lie.
The people who carry the lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their invented story, they can shoot the tops of the shoe to the door, bend to the east, significantly change the holding of the body, or show a "relief after the interview" - excessive relief breath and change of location when it is difficult to answer behind them.
The interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is near the end just to see how the relief will look after it ends.
Also understand the subject’s language.
The famous story is how Scott Peterson once swore and used last time to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which led to a national search for her body.
Deceptive individuals can also express themselves in measure: "I had no sexual relationship with this lady... Miss Levinsky" or the difficult question will repeat the whole thing.
The most common verbal signs are only very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "measurable language" to answer the difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... from what I know best."
We will not learn too many facts in such a response, and often it is another warning signal.
There is no spell to reveal every lie, but it is possible to master the skills by which a lie can be traced.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not hitting on a liar and a fraud in his personal and working life.
The controversial oil pipe construction plan will be redirected after the US Government's postponement threat has emerged
A few days after Obama’s government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which angered the trade unions, but calmed the environmentalists - the company that had built the pipelines in charge announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things could be moved again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will move the planned route of the pipeline from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the seat of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada's attitude, Alex Pourbax, argues that the company is convinced that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it will lead another route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it was suspending the decision on the federal approval of the project from which it did not conduct studies on possible replacement routes by which it would be possible not to intervene in the Sandhills region of Nebraska and the water-borne layer of Ogalala, a vast underground reservoir of water.
"This is really moving forward," said the Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably not have taken any decision until 2013, i.e. a year after the next year's elections, but the authorities refuse to have any role to play in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed his support.
1,700 miles of long pipe will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Albert to the refineries in Texas it will daily flow 700,000 barrels of oil.
Six states will have to cross this path.
The project is totally hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by the work crews, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear in the pipeline.
However, the legislators in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and in the Ogalla aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An ongoing study on the environmental impact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered, found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but the energy industry source said that the Inspector General of the Ministry had ordered a new review of the entire process of the initial study and focused mainly on two issues.
One day it was whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s advisor in 2008, was not represented in a conflict of interest program.

Patty LaBelle's accused of giving way to fear
The New York family claims that the singer Patty LaBelle has violently invaded their Manhattan house and frightened their daughter by throwing up fear.
The sound of the hit singer "Lady Marmalade" scared the 18-month Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
In November of last year, stage techniques Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a schoolteacher, and Genevieve were about to take a family trip.
When Kevin Monk pulled up the car, Roseanna Monk got packed down into the lobby of their house in Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "Yes," and I went to pick her up."
LaBelle, a pregnant woman, chastised herself.
"In an aggressive tone, she said, "You shouldn't lay your daughter at the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started talking dirty - she screamed out the simplest words...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started digging water out of me.
They say Genevieve has a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," the mother said to the child.
LaBelle was on her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - threw her and had to stop her until her escort, which then dragged her into the waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
In the meantime, my daughter screamed so much when she puked, she added it.
Later, the family sent a letter asking for an apology from LaBelle, but they did not receive any answers.
Lawyer and speaker singers LaBelle do not respond to our calls to express themselves to the whole causation.
The action requires an unspecified compensation but family attorney, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free of charge and that the family is planning to devote all the money he owes to a charity organization dedicated to children with cancer.
"The idea is to force Patty LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a schoolteacher holding an 18-month-old child in his arms."
The climate's animosity has stalled the economy.
During the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, unemployment and insecurity in Sinaloa have increased, foreign investment has declined, and the economy has also decreased with them.
This is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which is called the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year no growth has been recorded and even the main indicators of economic development have dropped.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of agricultural losses, reduced the growth potential of the state economy, reduced economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded in 582,835 hectares of farmed land, 78.03% of which were completely destroyed and partial damage was found in the remaining 21.07%.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geographic, the rate of unemployment in the State recorded an increase of 55,053 people in Sinaloa from January to March, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, average unemployment continued to rise and reached 6,19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed, compared to the first quarter, an increase of 18,969.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantese, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly, on the basis of steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of rising unemployment, which is related to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to resource constraints as a result of legislation approved by the Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering, and for people who illegally take the money it is not easy to earn it, invest it or use it," he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes said that the rise in unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who go to work abroad in the United States has decreased, however, because of difficult entry and then because even if these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job, so people stay and demand a job from our country, and so unemployment is rising," he said.
Uncertainty
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing uncertainty prevailing in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the state's employees work without making social security administration benefits.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and insecurity. In this administrative area, the lowest payments are from all over the country, as listed in the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was 5 352 pesetas until September, deep below the national average, which is in the amount of 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the most marked decline in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, direct foreign investment amounted to $630,697 between January and June, which represents a decrease of 87,74% compared to the amount of $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government of the State cites an investment of 17 280 million pesetas per year, mainly in service undertakings.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government of that State asked the Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. Local Congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. By November, no debt gains were recorded in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria López Valdés, pointed to a lack of government management skills.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformative Industry, stated that there was no matching of the will of individual sectors in 2011, including the government of the state itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We need to work hard to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012 we need to double our efforts, there was no harmonisation of the efforts of all of us, especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let us hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López stated that events as frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, among other things the frost, one of the main consequences was the slowing of the economy, which did not quickly remember enough to re-emerge the dynamism that would enable it to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year, we found ourselves deep under expected forecasts," he said.
Reconstitution of a mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriart, President of the Employment Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state must be pressed for more dynamic productive activities.
"We generally observe that we are working, we believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state will be redefined, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future that would better govern the government's efforts.
"In general, the government has been trying to achieve good results in various areas, in the area of economic development, there has been some progress, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration had shown progress in the conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is a job done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg marijuana
The Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a health threat offence, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN 687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 on a walk in Cipriano Valdez, opposite station 80 in the district of El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer drove in the delivery type pick up white. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and a small backpack on the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Department and the proceedings remained internal within the Centre for the Realisation of the Legal Effects of Crimes.
Project contributions due
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, Protection of Public Places and 3x1 for Migrants, face the danger that they will not be brought to an end or that they will be late due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development stated that if construction work has been going forward, he now threatens that the government of the state will not be able to provide adequate supplies requiring more than 11 million peso pesos for three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos. The state is 25%. Until then, only the Federation and the city have added funds to work, so it is possible that projects will be delayed when implemented.
"They're going to provide almost 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, we've got nothing at all. Even though we should have gotten a part already in July," he said. "Let's not waste time, we've started projects and continue very well, but we lack money."
He stated that in the last year, the State did not fill out the relevant supplies for the management of Jesús Aguilara Padilla, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to ask for a loan so that it could pay over 7 million which did not give them State administration.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. In order to get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to get the resources to cover what the state had not finished," he explained.
In spite of the fact that there is a promise by state officials concerning the transfer of these resources, he stated that the request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the secretary of administration and finance to speed up the procedure and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"They were to give us 12 million dollars, and even though a year is coming to an end, we haven't even got a pesos yet."
Court of Justice approves "end of analogous transmission" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of digital analog signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, which wants to speed up the so-called "exclusion of analogous signals" and to implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
The majority of the four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree setting out the individual steps that would lead to the transition to ground digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed, because the qualified majority of eight votes were not reached, so that the court could comment on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the said decree, which remains valid.
The proposal for a judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring a decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter which is legally reserved to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Coftel). Thus, there is a violation of the principles of hierarchical subjection and exceptions to the law.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero themselves voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described therein leading to the transition to digitisation.
The Meeting of Ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion on a proposal which also concerns Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify himself with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that federal executives could not structure measures, through general standards, to prepare public administration.
"I do not think that, even if it did, this would affect the autonomy of the regulator", and recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is subject to federal executiveness, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Reimbursement of analog signals by digital is one of the greatest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
It believes that distanceping the change would mean depriving the benefits of digitisation, which requires a decision in the matter of public interest. In fact, digitisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "it also concerns economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he pointed out, these questions "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a wide range of competences entrusted by the Constitution to the government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical authorities.
He pointed out that it was not possible for the government to introduce a non-agreementary decree that interfered to a certain extent with the scope of the Congress's powers in the area of administration of the laws prepared by the legislature.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to data published by the PRP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election is not a total of 27 per cent. So far, 879 votes from 6074 constituencies have not been counted.
The "voice after vote" option appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, in line with the figures published by the Pre-Electoral Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and the second in the governor's elections was 27 per cent, and the votes 879 from the overall 6074 constituencies have not yet been launched.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that several days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority had approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As is yet to be recalled, Michoacan has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Electoral Justice Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force had expired during this election period and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel had forgotten their publication within the time limit set in the Law of the Official State Journal by having objected to them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the State's voice in constitutional reform for "inapplicable and illegal" because it has no right to "not approve or veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council would allow for the conduct of a partial and total census by the local electoral authority.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages will be possible under the following conditions: voter results do not agree; there is no record of voter counting and calculation in the relevant box or it is not available by the chairman concerned; or if there are errors and obvious violations of election results.
In addition, the overall vote recalculation in all ballots will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential election winner and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an express request from the representative of the party appears at the beginning of the sitting and/or the coalition that proposed the candidate in the second place.
The overall vote recalculation will also be possible when, after a proper calculation, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is a explicit request from the political party whose candidate ends second place, in which case the electoral packages for which partial counting has been made will be eliminated.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to PREP there is a difference between the first and the second places of less than 0.16%, although 129 of the 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Popalinam Hill, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his home town. On Monday, a ceremonial ceremony and a lavatory mass will take place.
According to the family, it was the colonel's last wish that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinam Hill.
Having received the highest honors, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital city of Coahuila on board the plane of the Mexican Air Force. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the ashtrays arrived in a chapel located in the class of Nazareth Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell took place at the Technical Institute in Saltillo, which organized his former high school students and members of the American football team, whom Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes were scattered in the Zapalinam Hill. This is what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's sister.
According to her, the colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and graduated to the College del Aire flight school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went to his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "just arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him as when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he loved best: flying.
They gave him one last good-bye.
Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, said goodbye to all the honours he came to give up Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican air force itself, the leaders and students of the Technical High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled both in the studio and in sports.
Bácio Cortés died in the last days after the helicopter that was flying fell. On board was also the secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all officials of this state.
At 18:05 a.m., the remains of the Saltillen Rodriage Bacio Cortés (commended) arrived to be handed over by the Mexican Air Force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez to the field where his family, his daughter Amanda, and his wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on the Cadeyt NL ship
A few hours before the attack, the military representatives presented with a communication device 11 persons detained in this area for crimes connected with organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed in various parts of the body and the head were found on an abandoned ship of the village of Cadereyt Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
It was located 1.5 kilometres from the Cadereyt road to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
The people who were moving in these places noticed that the cabin with the beige-coffee fence had been open from time to time.
When they looked inside, about three meters from the distance, they noticed three people dead, so they immediately pointed out to the competent authorities.
One of the people wore a sport shirt of yellow and dark cotton pants and had no shoes. Also, there was a man lying next to him in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few metres further was the body of other persons dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were face down.
According to local data, all three persons were likely to have been killed elsewhere because bullets were not found.
On the fence, messages were found addressed to one group of organized crime the other, as well as a number of marks on bullets, both at the station and at the door.
11 suspects detained in Cadereyt.
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 people, including young people, who were members of a criminal group who operated in particular in the area of Cadereyt and who is associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the information published in the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 persons were detained and managed to free one detained person.
Three properties and a mobile phone have been secured, and they have confirmed that they are members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another raid took place on 12 November at 6 p.m. Military personnel were on a patrol in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyt, when they noticed cars without SPZ and two people.
After the car stopped, they conducted a search and discovered one rifle, shells and 18 rounds.
Then, on the basis of these statements, about 14 o’clock on 13 November, one of the accomplices in the La Fraud area was arrested.
They were accused of illegal burial in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Cadereyt.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country over the precipice of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country against the abyss of economic disaster and which has put the entire euro area at risk.
The President's Palace issued a report stating that Monti, appointed on Sunday, met with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could establish a government.
It is expected to present a government composed of a large majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of his talks, which he had with political parties in an effort to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that obstacles were overcome.
"The framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has led to the debt being raised to an unsustainable level.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Montim must approve a hard package of austerity measures requiring European leaders. It will only be possible to restore Italy's accumulated credibility.
There's a lot of pressure on Montiho to speed up, and due to the volatility of the markets, BTP's interest on Italian bonds has exceeded with a decade of maturity of 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to ask for rescue.
Emma Marchagglia, chairman of the Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this palate situation.
Monti's hopes for success have increased significantly thanks to the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, which the crisis forced on Saturday to resign.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelin Alfano told reporters, the mystery of the middle-law party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because up to this point a number of its members have opposed the government with the technological majority that Monti is building.
Parliament's support
The new Monti's government must have strong support for Parliament in order to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort in question could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has added to the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti started dealing with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth organisations and women on Monday.
The cycle ends on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, who allowed a very quick procedure to respond to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi was going to commit a demise, the interest on Italian bonds returned to the critical border and thus reacted to the uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would reap success.
To save Italy, whose public debt is set at EUR 1.8 trillion, would be beyond the scope of the current euro area financial reserves.
Monti stated that his government should stand by the power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, despite general prognosis, which claims that politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti stated that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the large parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to draw Italy out of the difficulties it has suffered due to financial pressure.
Political sources have indicated that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to integrate into the government and the political personality.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will exceed the limit of 50 international matches.
On Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 authorized players reached 50 matches.
Huge contrast on Costa Rica's side, if we compare 22 players of both countries who met today at a friendly game at 15:05 National Stadium in San José.
While world and European champions, number one FIFA monthly rating, have a wide range of class A interselective matches on their account, Costa Rica has only a defender of Michael Uman, who, as the only player, has played 50 international matches.
This number reached last Friday during a game against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish football players who play in the matches of the stars and in the powerful clubs of the English first league maintain intense activity over a year at league championships and home cups and high-level games within European Cups such as Champions League.
We also need to add to the previous one the experience of the national Spanish team in the complicated swordfights at the European and World Championships.
On the contrary, Costa Rican players have very limited options for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish team has the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who reached the former goalkeeper, Andoni Zubizarret, with 126 international matches, last Saturday before England (Draft 0-1 in London).
Casillas will go against Costa Rica today and get a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches at his end.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially declared UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have hundreds of matches at their end. Among them already mentioned Zubazarreta with 126 and the middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Hundreds of them also approached with a 97-game Carles Puyol.
Follow Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Uman, the left wing of Júnior Díaz has 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz has 45.
Next only 5 beat the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are included.
On the national side with less than 30 games standing Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rica side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in her tour at the occasion of the celebration of 20 years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts in the National Stadium next Sunday.
We've been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the opportunity to play Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent on the occasion of the celebration of 20 years of existence and will be on Sunday 20th at a unique stop in Central America.
This day will take place from 7:30 p.m. at the National Stadium along with the Angel Group The X and National Musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example of an interview that you can find on the website of La Nación.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans experience?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes a reality.
In South and Central America, we have barely been the second and previous experiences of being great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I ask, because here the group literally loves, fans experience these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your most insidious supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people are talking about concerts as the biggest show of the year.
Does that give you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've ever played in the last 21 years have occurred in the horizon for several weeks.
We've done some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope to get into the form of a concert in Costa Rica.
In fact, we look forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like surfing, we like jungles. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfers' friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing on Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best surfing sites. So we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a great show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we don't have any restrictions on what we can't do.
We will try to play the best show with various songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we're going to remember why we liked them so much and that maybe we've forgotten that already.
So the show's more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's even more interesting for people.
You've been celebrating this tour for 20 years.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure you are.
First of all, I don't think any of us have been able to imagine that we're going to be in one big rock band and that we're going to stay in it for more than 20 years, which sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given, and we are impressed that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we like to make music.
We're lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have gotten better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the formation of a grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which the greats themselves are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
Surprisingly, when the movement emerges from a group of friends, it often does not happen.
From time to time, a group will be formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to come from one city at a time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and have the same members after those years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think for the first time, we are all lucky that we are still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and this has enabled us to open up musical trails that allow everyone sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I don't think it could be any better.
Your relationship with the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was gradually becoming increasingly easier to find balance.
We try not to go too far on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, you will recall that you have to listen to music and respect what you have given it, and you must not let yourself be carried away by being famous rock stars, which none of us ever really cared about.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote some great songs, and at first it was something spectacular.
As a band, we existed for three years, and we never released an album, until after Andy died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. Most importantly, today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy as incredible as I laughed with him. It was always a joy to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The Las Robertas National Band will be assigned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as leapers?
Yes, production sent us videos with several suggestions and this group liked us the most. Therefore, we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer lively and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's words live?
That's Ed's question, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first one to attack him.
Who's affecting you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
I'm the first to be attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk about bass players I like all night.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunge even though it's not in fashion anymore?
I think we've always felt a little bit of a detachment from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I'll imagine the groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the others that were created at the same time. And if this is the way music works today, it's something great because it's the music that's worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
At first, your music had a slightly grim character and now it's more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting because I feel that in the new album there are a few songs that are easier to read, but also there are songs like The End or Just Breakfast, which are considered very grim, although they may sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're deep in darkness.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or your friend, these things will start to affect your art and your music, and these two songs to me represent this.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for the muscle loss he is suffering in the lower limbs, informed by his doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who has been serving the sentence of 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which led to his operation four times and is under medical control at the moment.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the Canal N TV station that Fujimori will undergo tests within three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why it hurts and why it loses its strength in the lower limbs.
Aguianga said that, in his opinion, Fujimori could receive mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not wish mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times because of cancer of the tongue, dropped 18 kilograms, and other maladies, such as severe erosive gastritis, salivary cysts, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in his legs, were listed by a doctor.
Fujimori has been serving sentences since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people killed by a murderous army squadron operating illegally in the early years of his government.
Mujica at a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation led by the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, with the aim of reaching an expansion of trade between the two nations and touching the political themes of the region.
Mujica meets her Mexican counterpart, Felip Calderón on Wednesday. It is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging visit to a full meeting with representatives of the politicians, traders and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The programme was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve as an exchange of information on political issues between the two countries", the Uruguay Presidential Office published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at a G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his statement, Sarkozy threatened that countries that continue to set aside for tax havens would be expelled from the international community and that this declaration had prompted Uruguay's rejection of the opinion and consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, the Latin American country has had an agreement to exchange information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has been working towards concreteising fiscal exchange agreements with a view to getting out of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have, since 2004, concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the spores of Bowser's villain, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to all shops around the world, has been created from the beginning to use all the characteristics offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who must say how the stereoscope should work without glasses," said a press worker specializing in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because until now successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adapted to existing titles.
The speaker Nintendo said that in addition to the 3D image, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth batch.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can go into the "second wheel" on the levels of the games that are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose the real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome various challenges and "do not give in to optical deceptions".
This new Super Maria launch in 3D also assumes the return of the character to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays the note to those who follow the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous parts. It is that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous washout platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in moves, in the surroundings, in disguises and also among enemies, there will also be "playful" Luigi.
Colombo approved the issuance of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken steps in the issue of the issuance of former President Alfonse Portilla, who is to be held accountable in the United States for laundering $70 million.
This is the end of a process aimed at having Guatemala respond to the request of the northern country, which requires the issuance of Portilla to be judged.
At the Colombo Press Conference, he confirmed that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive power and that it was remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the issuance.
He ensured that during his mandate he "did not interfere" in court decisions and authorized all the editions that were given to him on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be issued for murder and severe health injury and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloma's move represents a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead a process against the former President, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was found guilty of embezzlement of 120 million at the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency. This process preceded the issue, but the Ministry of Public Affairs withdrew and so returned the case to the game.
Trinieu helped 6,000 young people in danger
The organization was set up to help uneducated children not to be found on the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of Trinieu social support organisation is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped.
To this end, it is necessary to add a long number of jobs which have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also meant that the balance of the celebration act, which took place in the former production areas of the factory Fabra i Coats, was presented and attended by more than 300 people.
Trinitate Vella was established in 1986 to help young people with low education, without work, who are struggling with drug addiction or who might fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andrea was attended by a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions who have cooperated with the association in the last 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work being carried out by Trinieu.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujole, the celebration was attended by former socialist counsellor for education, Ernest Maragal, and former deputy mayor and current environmental and socialist councilman Ricardo Goma.
A current consultant for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and CEO of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also arrived at the large Fabra and Coats.
Mas said that Trinieu was created in a very difficult time and that today's time is also facing a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation".
The President set out Trinieu as an example of how it is possible to fight adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it does, nothing new," he said.
There was a removal of the forbidden house in which the giant parties were held
Intruders own 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
Everything suggests that the nightmare that the neighbors of number 51 in Balmes were experiencing is finally over.
Twelve people left the building yesterday at noon, which they illegally stayed in, and where they organized giant parties that woke up neighbors, and left the building in the court order without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent repetition of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," said the administrator.
The occupiers who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took all electrical and partly water equipment, and also painted the walls and left waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and awakened other tenants.
There's a disco near the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that during the time the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco stresses that the inhabitants of the building made her unfairly competitive, because they sold drinks for 3 euros while on the discotheque cost 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the neighbors' complaints for noise, but the problems did not cause the visitors to the discotheque, but the residents of the house, and especially those who participated in organized parties, whose frequency and intensity had increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the area.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and had been forgiving her rent for nine months.
The City Police also confirmed that they had received more complaints over the past few weeks from their neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP city party group at the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be immediately moved out and put an end to the problems of civic co-operation suffered by neighbours and the destruction of the area".
The president of the human race explained that only one staircase had been removed a year ago, but in recent months the invaders had reached all the floors of the building and almost all the flats and even stolen in one of them.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to actions against the civil responsibility that took place in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleaned out the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'clock 30 minutes, the police got into building 35 on Mont-ral street after the neighbors who saw her enter the building four people.
All four of them were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of the write-off of the proceedings, which brings with them more than controversy over the honoraries
The 16-gate city tender opens again the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, by the time of the greatest boom, the already disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was complemented by a numerical comparison with New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park came back to the minds of many as the upper limits of Barcelona. Catalan metropolis is one of few that are not oriented to the axis north-south, but to the top (top) - down (to the sea).
The qualification of Collseroly as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildlings instead of Yogi bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall declared mega competition created 16 competitions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, records rather the idea of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to put the gate in the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organisational point of view and on the basis of a reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona's architects.
It's as obliterated as the two members of this old caste chosen to meet in the elevator have their hand in hand.
And it was this act that sparked one of the rare matches between what three Barcelonan architects and pre-universal professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the selection procedure has its ground.
According to Roldan, after the question of the Gulf side began, "it is necessary" to discuss also the "hore side", so Ildefons Cerda's speech on green apples was not brought to an end.
"We must base the principle that the most vast Barcelona Park is the beach.
Among other things, his great availability.
Collserola is more complex", declared an architect for whom the name "gate to Collserola" includes "lexicological trap": we must not picture them as "inlet to the park, but rather as delimitation of zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, as well as Rodan and Bayon, with experience from the urban world, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" of "some danger".
The danger stemming from the "uncertainty which today is a public space project" after the experience of the 1980s, which had "his swan singing" in the Forum area.
The first fear is to define the boundaries itself, where it should be built.
"Something to define means to take another step," it is essentially to move one step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban and planning instruments, because the current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause real disaster."
If we focus more on the question, Modol believes that the Collserol valley slope can be "considered as a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already a job done by Patronat de Collserola, who "must not end up in a garbage dump", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his thunder that it will hit the project from "the first moment".
In addition, it means that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "disappears" that this should be the technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill", it adds), which needs to be created: "Archives should be only instruments".
Bayon suggests that the answer to the question given by the name of this game is complicated because there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola on the basis of the selection documents: "16 selection procedures have been announced, which deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole".
This means that at least he has applied for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the design of one gate can impact on the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his view, the town hall should ensure that the immediate zone situated above Ronda de Dalt should secure an entire area of equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino pardoned Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the lawful ruler Cadino Red granted the grace of the Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison, and now he will be released after the legal authority of Casino Red granted him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in that district, which discussed the case of extortion in which the mayor of Monterrey's brother was charged.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask him to pay for an economic quota to enable the Monterrey City Hall to operate illegally in a betting house.
After public prosecution, the State Attorney's Office initiated a criminal prosecution of the brother of the panic mayor. On September 2nd, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property offences, he was transferred to Penitentiary 1, located in Barrio Antigua, the capital of the state.
He remained in this position the next 49 days after the second regulation was issued for imprisonment, and an agent of the Ministry of Public Affairs denied the possibility of participation or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the Cadereyt Criminal Court for suspicion of the theft of the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only for a few hours in prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he received an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence had been gathered to prove Jonathan's guilt. The evidence included, for example, the payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for an oath that the operation would be possible.
This will be Monday with the legal authority of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, brought to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region. On this basis he will be able to return to freedom soon.
During the legal hearing, the representative of the Ministry of Public Affairs, assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the associates decided to grant mercy. The lawyer, however, made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of Official Journal 1197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal. In the proceedings against him there will be no complaint. Also, it is not possible to seek compensation for damage or punishment.
After his trial with the legal attorney around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larazábál Breton.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanez, arrived in a prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to announce to Jonas that he had been granted official mercy and his case had been postponed to the archives.
He also announced that the judge had issued an immediate regulation for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome presented details of the air accident in which the Governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident investigation, in which the secretary of the Government of Francisco Blake Mora died and seven others showed that the helicopter had reached the ground with full force without the pilot having the chance to attempt a forced landing.
At the Dionisio Pérez Jacome Press Conference, the Secretary for Communications and Transport, stated that before the start of the aircraft, the pilot had found that the climate conditions of the flight made it possible.
"Parts that appear suggest that the unit came several times in contact with the terrain, the wings became entangled in a branch of trees 25 meters from where the unit lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons and therefore met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, it was stated that no components were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the field of impact.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the plane were not located elsewhere, so the plane hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 persons, met all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The terrain shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director-general of airports and auxiliary services, stated that at the moment of impact, the President's General Staff helicopter was moving at take-off speeds and an accident occurred on a soft, rising terrain.
"This information supports the assumption that during the accident it was a normal flight operation," he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome named six basic points of inquiry:
Visual flights:
In accordance with the air standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate the appropriate starting conditions, in accordance with this aircraft heading at the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico, the apparent layers were clouded at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that, for the sake of darkness, the crew sought a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest radar track record are likely not to be damaged before impact.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a restricted area:
The information currently available allows us to assume that there has been a collision on an equal trajectory and side by side.
The design of the dispersion of the remainder of the aircraft indicates that at the time of impact on the mainland the helicopter was complete.
There was no fire or explosion recorded.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident that there had been an explosion or a fire.
The latest findings of the investigation show that several contacts with the mainland may have occurred.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at a height of up to 9200 feet above the sea, the terrain is weighed, the slope is between 7 and 30 degrees.
The photographs show the footage that probably broke down along the route.
The information provides elements which seem to indicate that the helicopter could reach contact with the countries in several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, no remains of the helicopter were found in an area that was larger than the area of the marking, which reinforces the assumption that the collision occurred in a state where the helicopter was still complete.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has initiated research on a gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to find the gene responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the Institute of IPN.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect a gene causing obesity in children and young people. A research entitled "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will enable you to obtain results on overweight.
In a report by Head of the Biochemistry Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st century Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition experts and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Institute of Polytechnics (IPN).
People can also participate in research by a wide public, with or without a right. People can come to the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where they will conduct youth tests in every congregation from 8 hours.
He stressed that research had started in the Cuauhtémo Sports Centre (Mexico State) and that since 8 October this activity was also carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
As soon as data are available from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Independent Sports Centre (beyond the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and significance of genetics in the development of obesity and to trace to Mexican children and young people the risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He pointed out that each Saturday with all participants carried out anthropometric measurements (weight, height, range), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, and gene testing (the genes involved in child obesity are being identified).
Cruz López said that this research reflects the concerns of health professionals over the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health polls between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, boys only experienced an increase in obesity by 77% and girls by 47%.
He said that one reason for finding indicators is that the population of the country differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African, which is reflected in the genes responsible for diabetes and overweight.
He explained that obesity is generally explained as an inability to burn excess energy, which we consume (calorie) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants was that they would be given an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thus finding out whether they were exhibiting any known weights or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark color wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm suggests the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and prediabetes.
The information is confidential so far, doctors hand it over to their parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and changes in lifestyles they must make to avoid their children’s disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle marked by a lack of daily physical activity, a full-day sit-in before television and the use of means of transport instead of walking at short distances.
The weight is also caused by a large calorie intake, which is a larger consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and a genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asphalt, UNAM won't make excuses.
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalt with polymers and thus creates a mixture of better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If the delay were to be properly taken care of, there would not be a need to repair nearly 200 000 debris after each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Region, Raphael Herrera Najer, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who at the same time added that if the construction and maintenance of asphaltic rains were adequate, there would be a significant limitation of the extortions, or even a possible removal.
In his lecture, the Technological Cause of the Excerpts, which he made during the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his leadership was developing modified asphalt with polymers, resulting in a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the production of tarpaulins.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the grouping of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with large molecular weights called asphaltites, and others with low molecular weights called maltins. Together, they supply asphalt with a typical viscoelastic character.
The visco-elastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, added.
This means that the resistance to asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but is changing during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperatures, the expert on chemical engineering warned.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de Mexico are covered with a flexible tile, consisting of six layers of materials, three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the highest layers are the asphalt cartridge, made up of small stones wrapped in asphalt and then pressed.
He pointed out that each stone forming the cartridge was paved with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the tiles are well decomposed.
If it was modified asphalt, they'd spread even better, he thinks he's a chemical engineer.
He added that the asphalt cartridge would contain the last layer called a soft stone coat, which is also sandy in asphalt.
Given that this layer will come into contact with vehicle rims, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt cartridge and must ensure the friction of the trolley.
Given that a heavy load will be exposed as part of the delay, the coat must have sufficient thickness and be careful of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great impact on the asphalt insert function.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads in and it's hard to get out, it causes the softening of all layers of mounds and thus the formation of leachings.
He explained that during the creation of the extortions, the first failed film of the coat and then there was damage to the asphalt cartridge. However, the damage does not occur at one time, but it is a slow process which should be stopped at the first marks by means of appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the generation of extortion, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of fortification must correspond to the load of vehicles and must ensure that the load does not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. For example, it is worth mentioning asphalt emulsions, which are already available in other countries and enable us to easily correct our demands without having to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss about becoming the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramirez Serna's failure to get Miss Colombia's crown.
Valle gets the 14th title of the first multi-mission.
Valle del Cauca did not reach Miss Colombia again.
Melina Ramírez Serna must have been satisfied with the fact that she found herself on the stage of the winners, gained a silver crown and sherpa, on the basis of which the new multimission of Colombia became the first.
Based on the results of the finale in Cartage, which won and saw Miss Atlántico, the department was awarded the 14th commission. Melina joined the women from Valle del Cauca, who had won the crown, but were eventually announced by the first commission. Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Girdo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question many people ask themselves.
The result is the defeat of the great favorite, which in all previous rounds has shown that it has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain has become the Queen's Police and the cutest face of Joel de Volgue. These titles have reached, for example, the Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which subsequently took the title of Miss Colombia as well.
One of the key factors that has decided that the jury has only decided to name her First Multimiss is the fact that she has not convinced her answer to the question, "What book did you like most and why?" submitted by Martín Murillo Gómez of Leamos' literary edition.
The candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in childhood was "Little Prince", a very deep book.
Today I am reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have a book by Irene Nemirovski, Russian author. It is a beautiful book entitled "El ardor de la sangre".
However, this response was not appreciated due to the term "culturalize" and the second because the candidate failed to explain what the individual books mentioned to her had pointed out.
After the graduation of the Melin ceremony, she said that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise to become, it will happen.
And you people, read, if you can, the little prince is a beautiful book."
One other hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogo journalist pointed out that the candidate was the most popular, the most famous, and the one that took all the previous prizes (The Gastronomic Challenge of Oster, the public title for the best art dress and the Queen's Mother) had aroused the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned herself on the stage.
It was observed during the first presentation of swimsuits on the Hilton beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Even though she was on both of them, she knew that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm that represented the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantica.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the Canal RCN programme, believes that Melinda won the title first multimiss confirms the fact that a candidate who gets the most titles during the competition does not end up with the crown of the queen."
Plus, Valle's attitude towards the media has been rather rude in recent days, and that hasn't paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the foundation of the National Beauty Competition.
On the margins, two days before the election, the international member of the jury, Lucy Doughty, said they were looking for a woman who would consciously understand the social needs of her country.
"In Miss Colombia's contest of beauty is not enough for itself, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social sentiment. It is important that candidates be involved in such projects before entering the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the lack of her background and fibrosis, which was seen on her ass. This is, however, completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernan Orozco, who prepares the queen, admits that Melina had not the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with the fibrosis on her butt, which, in my opinion, was not too familiar, took her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the parents of Valle made a mistake when she took several surgical steps.
"Surgery interventions are fine, but they didn't succeed in Valle.
The body was never her strong side and here she chose her tax."
Because of this appreciation, which for the first time gave the National Beauty Gathering, there was a harsh prediction that came to pass after the parade in the swimmers. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina had given to her, so that he did not finally have to give her the highest crown.
Whether it's true or not, it's certain that Melina began her year of reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, it is recorded in history as one of the queens who, despite the overwhelming success in Cartagen, have not reached the highest crown.
That was the work of the resident of Cali, who identified the corpse of Alfonse Cana.
A fingerprint expert from Cali has entered history as a man who confirmed the death of the Alphans Cana.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year, an expert on fingerprints from the CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of High Leader Farc: "Alphonse Cana", through a comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprints experts working at the CTI department, this week was a series of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejad who worked for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to search for more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the dead were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle, and after completing the courses, he began specializing in fingerprinting.
On the week of the operation against Alfonso Cana, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmir.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead bodies and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest Guerilla in the world, so they asked him to take a card with Guillerm Leon Saenza's fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he came with the investigation team to the site where the dead was found, he didn't recognize him because of his physical suspicions, and he looked completely different from the media.
He had no beards, dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Along with the galton shell, ink and transplanter, Eliazar began comparing the Dactyl records of the corpse with the records of the card.
His eye didn't disappoint him. It was the Alpha Cano.
That very night, a man from Puerto Tejada was assigned to confirm to the Secretary of Defense Juan Carlos Pinzón whether it was really the Chief Commander Farc.
Search stop
For the dactyloscope of Siyán de Cali, the recognition given to President Juan Manuel Santos by Eliazar González at the press conference of operational service against the Cannai is very important.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscope is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people assist in investigating crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons caught.
When caught, many delinquents present false documents or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator told us that in the event of injuries, he had to remove a piece of the house wall in the house because at this point the thief leaned on to pull out a vault full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we could get a full hand print and identify the perpetrators who participated in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in case of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the fingerprint on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Even though he can't be confirmed as a real killer, it's obvious he showed up on the scene of a crime.
The fingerprints expert from the CTI explained that the prints are "toed with chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, a transplanter or tape is used to collect it.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or the Registry.
"The problem is that there are currently many Colombians whose data have not been recorded anywhere," said the expert from the CTI.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that sparkles, there's no gold, not everything that you touch, there's traces.
However, if it can be used, the relevant comparison must be made.
"Inflammation" protested in New York City
Hundreds of manifestists were in distress at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to stay.
A large part of them waited for orders to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Movement Cast Wall Street provoked the New York officials on Tuesday, when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square, where they were taken out in the morning, and then tried to take another New York Park.
Hundreds of manifestists struggled on Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allowed the "disgusted" to return to the scene. The second part of the movement reacted to the removal by taking the park to the north of the city, where further detention took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and we will continue in the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through meetings and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the speakers of the "Let's sit down Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray pointed out that the response of the "disturbed" to the camp, which was ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg himself, came to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a warrant prohibiting the forced removal of the site and allowed the manifestants to continue to settle here.
In addition, another park located on central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the property of the parish in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and kept some manifests. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw the handcuffs put on some journalists as well.
The organization assures that several hundred people settled on site, and a delegation of religious representatives came to support them and sought to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the transferred manifests even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to members of the square, which caused "some small clashes", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some of the police manifests were being held.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or using "the laws that were published after the ban began, or prohibiting the manifestant from accessing the park with shops or other places that were previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, in view of this court order, the city had suspended the re-opening of the public space and the manifesto pointed out that local laws did not allow them to return to the tents and spasms.
The highest representative of the city personally defended the early expulsion of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and to which it was admitted because the manifests "violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the square to evacuate because it was "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break laws and in some cases to hurt others" because "some shops got threatening letters" and "neighbored the quality of their lives".
"The early elimination was shocking and it shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added a spokesman who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also stated that they are planning to organize a "big event" on Thursday, in cooperation with community and trade organisations, to recall the two months after which protests took place, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will represent Miss Maria on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bubble and other important Canadians will appear on the television programme "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Kanadjanka Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in Home Improvement, a swimmer in "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", the wife of a rock musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will be Miss Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV station CTV announced today that Anderson and his sentimental song singer Michael Bubble and other important Canadians will appear on the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st and will embody the Virgin Mary.
Today CTV showed footage from a television program, in which Anderson, also known as Internet-based pornographic images, appeared with her ex-husband, the motor "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appears on the scene, the famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently served as moderator for the tour "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Crome Anderson and Peters appear on a special Christmas broadcast by CTV, the Canadian singer Bubble, who married at the end of March in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York "the fox".
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP is rising by 1.5% due to household consumption and the fall period, which began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake that has escalated into the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government measured the material losses of $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global situation, is healing well.
After three quarters of the fall, GDP between July and September reached such a position that it was possible to rotate the page definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan the tax year begins in March 2012 - in addition, they anticipate the biggest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery that is necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
The companies increased their investments by 1.1%, spending dwindling by 0.9% compared to the period of January to March. This is the first decline in six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy stems solely from an impulse that forces us to use the crisis to step out of it, or to rebuild infrastructure, which is to use the lack to start completely from scratch.
Japan has awakened, especially due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1% due to an increase in vehicle expenditure, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The flows were placed in the hands of the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "saving values" for investors fleeing the euro area debt crisis and against the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, however, a great burden for exporting companies.
With stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July to the yen course in September.
While the markets continue to surround the EU's peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
And really, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) specified that most Member States presented clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts lack of flexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area even got below the average of 100. It reached 99.13 points.
Athens is once again spreading uncertainty
Papadimos says that austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With fast and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty it has once again overtaken, Greece is becoming increasingly involved in a maze that leads to an exit from a major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "agreement" of the new Greek transitional government is given rather than the requirements of Brussels, rather than the genuine belief of the political forces, is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days he had been given during his appointment would probably be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonios Samaras, said that he would not support new austerity measures in any way and repeated his request to propose new elections on February 19th.
"The main task of this government is to apply the summit decision of 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate which will culminate tomorrow in a vote on government confidence.
The package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify any doubt as to his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The President of Conservatives went to the EU and IMF address a little further. These organisations have to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, he stated that he would not support and sign any commitment regarding the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, which has already had an impact on Papandre's games with a referendum, stressed yesterday that its requirements are inextricable: it will not block any aid unless the new government and representatives of the main parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The speaker for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens and will deal with the new government about "what it needs to pay the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek bean has a little more to go with.
Queen Sofia: "There are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen raises Spain’s high-ranking position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at the global level with regard to microfinance".
Yesterday, the Queen of Sofia recalled that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades as regards this cooperation instrument, whose essence is that "this is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man".
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th World Microlomies Summit in Valladolide with the belief that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is the fulfilment of the objectives to achieve a reduction by half of the number of people living with less than one dollar a day, i.e. the amount that sets the poverty threshold".
Spain will "continue to work" and expand the volunteer network "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of Summit, which will last until Thursday, will "make sure of the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", to which these loans are intended in particular.
"We have achieved many" and "many challenges are still ahead."
The Microloans Summit should be not only a discussion forum but also a platform that will support the "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families had access to these financial services and that 100 million families had reached the threshold of poverty under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and other countries of the world after "the pioneer of the thought of Muhammad Yunus" was given to the Queen and added that it was "the act of justice and the necessary recognition".
The father described this tool as "an admirable idealist who went on the road to combat poverty." She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get to know him directly on the spot with his lending policy.
The first global summit in Washington, D.C. and other meetings, such as in the Ivory Coast in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to find a steady development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned her the title "head of the family", which in Valladolid gave her a "moving of the poor".
The Queen of Sofia concluded her speech by calling on the participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions, thus allowing them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, stated that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" which must govern all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with a period of ballooning, because this cooperation is a "personal obligation".
Jimenez believes that micro loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever before, governments in developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criterion and not allow solidarity to become victims of the massacres.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The state secret for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success of the concept based on the trust of people to whom everyone else closes the doors. Mayor Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed the participants in the city who "opens their gates to the spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
CDU proposes to elect a European president on the basis of general election law
Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and the President, the Christian Democratic Party, Angel Merkel, took place on Monday 14 November in Lipsk on the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The future of Europe was not an issue of the programme originally, but it was not until autumn, especially so that the members of the parties who consider the government's policy today vis-à-vis the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow to the Italians would be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission submitted by management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine out of the 1001 delegates opposed and 10 delegates abstained.
Several minutes' ovations stand at the end of Angela Merkel's performance and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarized in the slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "the time of change has come".
This could be expressed by the amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general electoral law "in order to give Europe one face".
In any case, one of the ideas of a motion adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the UK and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same stand.
But the direction's out.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the European Central Bank’s representation, depending on the weight of its economy, which will clearly lead to a strengthening of Germany’s weight.
A leading concern to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor made several references to Konrád Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not try to get a Congress talking about "small" European states or states in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Even though the proposal concerning Europe deals with one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirect.
When she remembered that a bloody battle had taken place in Leipzig just two hundred years ago.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a fraud in the case of inability to work?
Following support, the UMP and the government launch an offensive against disability.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Office for Social Assistance, where he will address the topic of the repeat since 2007 on combating social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an escort to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased severity, but it is not less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on the inability to work.
First, due to budgetary savings, the government intends to force private sector employees on the fourth day of inability to work before they start taking aid in the disease.
Clearly, without the consent of the company, an employee who is ill would have lost four days' wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
The measure that risks causing many bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
Also, measures that would be accompanied by further measures of symbolic reach: to give state employees one day unspoiled incapacity (until they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these questions are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority also launches the subject of fraud this time on villains associated with inability to work.
"The controls will be much more extensive and in addition: if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand informed Xavier Bertrand in an interview with the station RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate given the truth about the injustices in the workplace.
These were, in fact, the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and political tensions that brought fruit.
The French are no longer sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop by a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM - State Health Insurance) more than € 237 million was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008 daily refunds amounted to EUR 11.3 billion, representing 5% of health expenditure.
Of this figure, 46% related to maternal contributions and accidents, and 54% related to incapacity for work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
That means only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average of certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com's work opportunities pages showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned replied that they had not chosen a day of incapacity.
Another study, carried out by the hospital insurance institutions this time, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of the working disabilities were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to be incapacitated.
One long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence (for health reasons or not) was stagnated in France between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Great Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
Misleading in the workplace represents only a very small part of the work on black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks aimed at incapacity to work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that 13.8% of the 285,000 short-term inability to "unauthorised or too long" cases were carried out in 1.5 million controls, i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity beyond 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorized" were calculated for 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unauthorised" cases for several million employees who had incapacity to work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work on black.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this question, this number would be 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the year’s tax collection, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and therefore infinitely more than the frauds associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos delivered those words to Parliament and added that a hundred days of unity given to his government would not suffice to fulfil this task.
"To re-establish our economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new rescue budget plan," the Prime Minister said when he delivered his first public address on Wednesday when he launched a debate on the vote on confidence in Parliament.
The application of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the euro area summit will be "the main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is in the game, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the public deficit of the country would from now until the end of the year "in the vicinity of 9%" of gross domestic product after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights refuse new austerity measures
On Monday, the Justice Leader, Antonios Samaras, expressed his support for the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party was not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," said Samaras at a meeting with the Members for his new democracy.
We have agreed on the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without the written guarantee of all parties supporting the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Commission of Experts.
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians were denied death.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives on the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the possibility to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and to make decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report of the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government change the criminal law so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice is necessary for a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
In the beginning, experts quote a recent poll by the Independent Agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada has placed itself in 10th place, the study notes that "medication of death in Canada has given rise to cultures in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medialization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, they tell us experts with the Royal Canadian Society's mandate.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average is valid for all of Canada, while in Québec province this number is the highest with 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that they are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already said that there is no change in the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also subjected all countries to controls where these approaches are legalized or are not considered to be a criminal offence, there is no evidence that this criminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide against persons who do not or who do not agree.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downe, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at the teleconference more than numerous cases of these too many things in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assist suicide is also committed in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians are inclined to euthanasia
Recall that according to the 2010 Angus Reid Forum, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will enable the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believes that legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we're sending messages that the lives of old or handicapped people are less valuable.
As far as those who practice assisted suicide are concerned, 41% of the persons questioned consider that they should not be prosecuted.
In the case of maintenance or interruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that criminal law should state that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires professional doctors to be trained to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silence already used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered no longer serving to reduce physical pain, for euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations to other experts
Some medical law experts have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of the report's experts as "extreme" because, among other things, he does not limit euthanasia to patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who has been tired of life and who should have been over 18 years of age could ask to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied summary reports yesterday.
P. Deschamps also points out that it seems as if the authors of the news have built the autonomy of the people above all the other values that form the social front of society.
Because in companies, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions.
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also voiced strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as "a manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, himself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts particularly the date of the report concerning the lack of doubt in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the American state of Oregon.
Jordanian King challenges President Assad to resign
Damašek speaks of "complex"
Cheese is becoming more and more isolated
The followers of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures were intensified on Syria by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists and speaks of a "complex" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, took an opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordanian King Abdullah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state to call upon President Bashar al-Assad to bring about the killing of some 40 civilians and members of the regime in Syria, "transmitted power".
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at his heart, he would have to demise, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
On his side, chief of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the efforts made to Turkish mediation under the Syrian regime had not been crowned with success since the beginning of the year.
"Those who do not live in peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, with an emphasis on neighbouring Syria, against which Turkey applies ever harder and harder lines.
The United States was encouraged by the fact that consensus on Assad and the Syrian regime had been strengthened following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"International Communities, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying ever harder tone" to the repression in Syria, marked Mark Toner, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
During this time, as reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces died in the city of Deraa in southern Syria.
According to this NGO, two other civilian persons were killed in shootings and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in Jobar's area of Homs.
However, during the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouall estimated that the country "was on its way out of the crisis".
He also reacted vividly to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend the Damascus membership, which, according to him, represents a "dangerous step".
"Syria won't bow down," he said with assurance that "complexes won't succeed against Syria."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the League of Arab States is currently considering a mechanism for protecting civilians and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, is also favourable to the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes is "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League is convened tomorrow in Rabat to take an opinion on the crisis plan, which was decided on December 2nd and which included particularly the withdrawal of military personnel from towns in conflict and the release of prisoners.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered yesterday's decision by the League of Arab States "major", while China urged Syria to adopt a crisis plan, but completely avoided supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti Demands Time and Victims of Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will contain the "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner discussed with political parties before meeting today with representatives of trade unions and employers.
It should draw up a relatively thin cabinet consisting of technocrats that do not belong to the parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the planned Prime Minister.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfr Fini, expects that Mario Monti will ask Parliament by Friday to express his confidence to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with the presentation by Mario Monti of the small team of twelve ministers of President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti said yesterday he was nervous about financial markets and asked for time.
In "democracy, the exact terms" are applied when it comes to the preparation of the government and its programme, stressed and added that it is "sure that markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president had been received favourably from the beginning, but concern again emerged after the unexpected collapse of industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should draw up a team comprising mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to adopt "politicals".
He expressed his conviction that the new government would stand by 2013, i.e. until the next election date.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfrance Fini's new government will have the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency after taking office and to make Italy's "renewal" a strong Article" of Europe.
Speaking European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "and with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is balanced by the 2013 budget, and demands new tough measures.
The head of the Confindustria Emma Marchaggli Business Union, who meets Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revitalise the economy"or a country that does not show growth cannot adhere to the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognised for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizing according to the authors of the founders' call for seriousness" and "other Italy", represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The great stranger will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place state bonds of EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran’s nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop the detonator used for the nuclear weapon, announced on Tuesday an American NGO specialising in atomic risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents escaped from this UN agency when identifying a scientist.
Last week, the IAEA reported its "serious concern" with regard to the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the Institute of ISIS, the broad drawing of IAEA documents by V. Danilenko (Nar. 1934) had been working three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet Military Research Centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, the Centre had to leave to set up a company producing nano diamonds in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was to cooperate from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian program.
In his latest report, the IAEA recalls "explained that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked during a substantial part of his career in this technology under the country's military nuclear programme."
Anti-Muslim crime and delinquency increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of criminal acts and acts directed against Muslims rose by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined slightly or slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase compared to the 13% in violence against Catholics, 4% in crimes against Jews and 14% in anti-religious crime and delinquency.
The total number of "negligible criminal acts" has risen to 6,628 cases, 47,3% of which were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the 2009 withdrawal, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again," the Human Rights First organization dealing with human rights stressed, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly important," she added in her communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hateful crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the leaders of Paul Legendre.
"The American government can and must do more to deal with these atrocities," it adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports of "near crime".
The "hate crime" in American federal law is the legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This legal order was passed after Martin Luther King died to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
Twitter's micro-blog page introduced changes in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the follow-up activity, which is somewhat likened to its Facebook services.
New offers of "activity" and "name" allow you to better and directly know the activities of others who follow you or those whose answers ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to monitor the contributions, whether they are logged in to the new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested"in August at a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the whole network on Monday, told AFP spokesman for Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated distribution of a contribution by someone else, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'uvre ainsi and un public plus large avec un manner plus comparable and goals des résaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network users immediately in their "tweets" assess the importance of this innovation.
"It's unnecessary, it takes a lot of places and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function Activities will help me better to follow some elements of my Twitter," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
entering a golden rule on a balanced budget in the Constitution
The Government of the Grand Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to enroll the "golden rule" of budgetary policy in the Constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid any possible reduction in Austria's rating agencies (AA).
He was socio-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself, who announced this decision at the conclusion of the ministerial advice in a situation where Austrian public debt is 74.6% high above the criterion of 60% by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than those of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more each year on an annual basis," argued Multi-Cencial and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger, the Christian Democrat.
Austria therefore applies to the request of the euro area summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that the public deficit be reduced by the end of 2012 and the balance of public accounts be entered into the constitution or the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0,75 % of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal countries, as well as the municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to make public debt under the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if he had only to continue to strengthen.
"We're going to hit you the last time we did this, if we find out too much instability" in the exchange course of the yen, explained Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, he again stepped up to historical values, which on October 31st forced the Japanese authorities to intervene.
That day Tokyo sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently overcame the dollar’s record of 1945.
But only since then has he regularly stepped up supported purchases of investors who consider him to be a "safe port" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and a European debt crisis.
The dollar again on Tuesday under 77 yen, and the euro fell below symbolic lac 105 yen near the levels that sparked the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
This inflammation of Japanese currency damages island exports because it undermines the price of Made in Japan products and lowers the value of Japanese earnings from foreign companies when they transfer them to domestic currency.
"Japan recovers" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami, which devastated the region of Tohoku in the northeastern part of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this ostracism will not kill a deer in a fragile recovery egg.
The third economic power of the world restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% due to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year due to the exploration of export growth and household consumption caused by disaster.
But the Prime Minister considered that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BOJ) to start a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures leading to a weakening of the yen.
But the governor of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had already adopted "appropriate measures" indicating that no additional monetary impairment could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities Emissions increased by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion) its purchases of State Treasury vouchers and increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts devoted to the purchase of various securities with a view to carrying out liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates rise, storms fail
The risk of debt crisis diseases continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European storms are still concerned about the stability of the euro area and are falling into negative expectations today on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hours the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new tensions around euro area loans in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to generate only part of the recent profits".
"Nerves are only too aware of the risk of the disease," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange closed down by 0.7%, which it suffered because of concerns from market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes fixed on Europe and the shift will continue only in a narrow variation corridor until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," estimates Mitsubishi Akino, fund manager at Ichiyos Investment Management.
This relaunching of uncertainties about the future of the euro area will damage the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has reached the lowest level since one and a half months ago.
At 10 o’clock, the European currency has a value of $1.3570 at a discount of 0.4%.
According to currency brokers, after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU accepted a proposal at its congress on Monday, an expected opportunity to step out of the euro area for countries in difficulty without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
This morning, on Tuesday, the Italian ten-year bond yield is 6.85%, and the Spanish ten-year bond yield is 6.2%.
These tensions at the interest rates of South European countries, but also in France, continue to exacerbate the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time on the markets to fix the situation in Italy threatened by poisoning caused by the height of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of the decisions taken on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit would be a "primary task" of his government.
Spain is once again in the intentional market direction when elections to the Chamber are held in the country on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
In anticipation of euro area growth figures
Statistical figures say that France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter mainly caused by household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised its downwards figure for the second quarter to fall by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And it's actually the fourth quarter that the economists are most concerned about.
Germany registered an increase of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must prevail over the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be tackled on the basis of short-term considerations or under emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for the election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that captures the energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will now trigger by 2050 a double demand for electricity if we do not want a significant part of the world's population to get rid of important parts of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to face a lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity and it is not necessary to forget the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is a topic that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
An accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains only in its decision to refuse nuclear power.
This is not the case of Belgium, which subordinates its decision to the need to find any other source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only the power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continues with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant crashed.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts it.
Berlin's choice is demonstrated by the auctioning of electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported in particular from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, of which 30% of its electricity is collected, is also one of the largest coal and gas consumers because of the irregularity of the wind, which makes the emissions of CO2 and the prices of Danish electricity 65% higher, respectively, 50% more than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay the electricity bill by 40% higher than the amount that the French households pay.
While in the globalised economy energy costs represent a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of the industry in the national territory, French companies benefit from the most cheap electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would give rise to a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illustrative beautiful declarations of the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, nor do they substantially oppose this energy, as demonstrated by public opinion surveys.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to be set up with 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 incoming jobs.
Strong exports to international markets involve a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises creating jobs that cannot be converted abroad.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have lost EUR 6 billion a year to export nuclear facilities and services to the country.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while planning a fall in its manufacturer?
When dealing with the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, even that there is no devilish.
The development of low CO2 emissions facilities and renewable energy installations carried out by the French REVA Group shows the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionality is recognized, have the idea of safety in the blood.
Fifty years later, the nuclear industry became aware of three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred under normal operating conditions and remained without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concept of a reactor and inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as much as it did in the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and constructions is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift to the competitors of the REVA Group and the EDF company and opening the way for them to take the lead in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations control the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the inculcating of police, courts and administrations of subordinated numbers policies, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights", which France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment, the object of which were foreign students, which became current when the Minister of the Interior (see the letter Libération of 23 May) declared that France "necessary talent, zodiacs and serviettes are not needed".
But so far, it's been rarely discussed under the corner of the economy.
It is necessary to say that there is quite a broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
In 1976, Jacques Chirac stated that "9000000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left hand of Michel Rocard, when in 1990 he said that France could not accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of hordes of Polish installers in French territory was shared on the right and on the left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we set out to give to immigrants.
In his program François Hollande limits himself to banality when he states that joint development will enable us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and problem may be true in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As noted by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restrictions on immigration hamper growth and the detriment of employment.
Concerns about the effects of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and put pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for French employees by doing jobs in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer places.
A Positive Effect on Wages
Like a surgeon, there will be difficulties in working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between France and migrants cause the arrival of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
However, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in Europe on an average of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation, for example, estimates that one immigrant will arrive in Germany at 30 years of age for his whole life in public budgets with a net contribution (acceptance minus expenditure) of EUR 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish at the beginning of his mandate to go for the missing percentage of growth "with precious teeth".
These teeth used to discourage immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be considered
Democracy is rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember that, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, Holocausts, gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece during the 20th century.
Some people might believe that in order for democracy to definitely triumph over its enemies, it will be enough to make the choice and conduct it in the most direct manner possible.
But he knows from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
General electoral law, even though democracy is a necessary condition, is not a sufficient condition and can become a "depressive instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of power and control, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been the crisis of politics and democracy since the beginning.
Recognition of the Greek referendum's error of type yes-no will have in this direction the value of double revelation: revealing the necessity of a great return of political power, but also revealing the disturbing sense of his inability, his inadequacy.
This ambition must be designed to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic engagement have now moved and that many Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we require a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganised.
Bianko exposed to the European absolute monarch or jump with tied legs to empty nationalist depths: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want the knives of guillotines, but the common, full, peaceful and uninterrupted exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop the calculation - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is a whole Europe leaning against the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe, which is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty and with it each one of its nations.
The governance of the European democratic sovereignty project must urgently be restored.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burdens of their debt, to rid themselves of market governments and to prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will assume a decision at European level that will not be able to be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us into disaster.
After fighting this socialist proposal for a long time and Jacques Delorse, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
Be my guest.
But to think without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European building.
To form a republic in France, it was necessary to be a republican.
The revolution in the interest couldn't have done enough.
This lesson continues.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will be possible only by building a Europe more politically democratic and truly European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
The "uncontact" chip card is spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere it opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the World Cup of Chip Cards.
In 2011, according to the Eurosmart Cabinet, an increase of 11% in the world’s sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM cards) to more than 6 billion units should end up.
The most nasal segment is the non-contact technology that allows you to pay in bulk transport or to make purchases just by approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold around the world 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should continue to rise in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total map market (6,925 million cards).
After being long on the APEC country's tow, Europe is gaining ground without contact.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to set a higher rate, banks need to equip their clients from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their clients touchless bank cards," declares Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step to the future payment tool: mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for the execution of transactions is only a small number of instruments equipped today.
"They're late."
"But their real swing should take place next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sales worldwide to 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are getting ready in advance.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of the Caen test, which will take place from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a wide range of non-contact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Societe générale announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay their mobile phone without touching.
The terrorist front goes from Sahara to Nigeria.
Paris is concerned about the alliances between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
Long-term suspicions that there are alliances of the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Minister of Algeria Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria has since acquired certainty.
"The way both organisations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that there is great cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
It seems that Paris has similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help light the connecting bridges.
After the abduction of AQMI members from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Leocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during the operation carried out by special French units.
French and Nigerian investigators were supposed to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists in the floods after the hit.
Terrorist Axis
Analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maidugura, a city in northern Nigeria, which is a cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to be close to AQMI and sect.
"It is progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has enjoyed external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo, a milder statement.
In recent months this "support" has been more and more obvious in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operating procedures, which since now include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same method of implementation as those used by the AQMI.
The international community at the head of Washington has since developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems that Boko Haram has caused.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little good interest.
Quick Success
The sect Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "Western education is sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a link has a rapid success.
The section is politicised and requires strict observance of Islamic law of the sharia, while its supporters are starting to fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram's supporters became extremely active and multiplied their attacks against police stations.
The government's reaction is as usual still the same.
The army will surround the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Yusuf sect is caught and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its territory in the north.
At Christmas 2010, Jos assassination will take place in the city of Jos, where 80 people will die, followed by another in the capital city of Abuja.
In June, it's back in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, from now on concerns all security specialists.
Now, when Al-Qaeda of Islamic Maghreb surrounded Mali and the games and Somalis from the Al-Shabab movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in an emergency and is ready to "transfer all the information".
World according to presidential candidates
On issues relating to China, Iran or Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are being pushed forward in simplification and ignorance.
Can America’s weakened crisis govern the world with simple or even simplistic thoughts?
By listening to presidential candidates, voters would think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated loud statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point of the republicans.
Often, unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or Israel’s aid come together.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Grand Old Party competition, threatened by calling the Chinese to the World Trade Organization and accusing them of manipulating their currency, which in America is an instigated topic of migrating all parts of its industry towards Asia.
Worse, if this must contain the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former Obama ambassador in China and a single candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost choked in a position that "cools" emotion.
He demanded a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now President Obama's position).
But Huntsman, who is in the final polls, remains unheard of.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions were unsuccessful in stopping its nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," declared the fanfaron.
"If Obama is elected again, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase the military assistance of Israel, accusing Obama of having failed in his responsibilities toward this partner.
Businessman Cain, second best placed candidate, demonstrates the awkward ignorance of documents.
He recently called for an acute stand against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing is trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - clearly unknown fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michel Bachmann.
They are all far away from the Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opposers of the current president say Reagan also had simple thoughts and nevertheless won a cold war.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in a matter of fighting terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the kidnapped departure of the boy from Iraq, his excuses concerning Libya, and thus assign him a weak label
But the attack isn't easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which was removed by Ben Ladin, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military intervention that leads to congestion.
And with the argument that we need to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leading position, Obama knocks on the right place.
Nord Stream, Russia's new entry port to Europe
The Nord Stream remote pipeline connecting directly eastern Europe to Russia and led by the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to function.
They must supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas station, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them four chief states and governments, took part last Tuesday in the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together to control the Russian gas entry valve into the Western European network.
This new pipeline will begin to flow 27,5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas every year to western Europe by the first pipeline of 1,224 km connecting the Petrohrad region to the Mecklemburst-Pomoryan Federal Country.
The second pipeline to be completed at the end of 2012 will allow a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the quantity equal to the entire French consumption.
The possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route is already recalled.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
Nord Stream will actually allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being driven by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing a little power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats of closing its access to Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
The most strongly expressed was Warsaw, when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "German-Soviet Pact", with the withdrawal of the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say it's a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created gaps between Europeans from the east and the west.
Russia managed barely five years ago to advance its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western nations with high gas consumption, whose bearings are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon during the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated the point in which large gas pipeline contracts of things are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in a large number of Lubmin, the gas main point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical activity.
The submarine pipe is made of steel equipped with concrete cloaks to protect it from anchors of sea vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction it was necessary to avoid minefields originating in World War II.
"For safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures to protect fauna and flora should also be stepped up.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffel shells, which at all its length is nowhere interrupted by either valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedishs were only a little eager to see the Russian state company, as it permanently settles at their shores.
"In case of failure, we stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, because the welds were designed to form the weld once within 100,000 years.
The outboard gas pipeline is controlled by a submarine robot drawn by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This fertiliser-shaped device with a diameter of 1 metre is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is gas-pressed.
In the target throughout three days of travel, the speed of 3 m/s will provide accurate information on any distortion of metal parts.
The remote gas pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for a single repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds a 51% share.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunia and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint enterprise called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has its headquarters in Zuug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely convenient.
The gasprom subsequently rented this company for five years with a contract which could be restored, all its capacity for gas transport.
"Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, however much gas is actually transported in any way," explains Jens Müller.
Funding for gas pipeline construction was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, investment costs were thus up to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will come back, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The high-velocity valves make up an exit gate of gas.
The sensors shall measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming gas before being transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
In achieving the full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to recommit the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of the candle.
The writer Moleskine is easily identifiable by his black rectangular boards and sends out his leaves with white colors as if in age.
After all, the writer Moleskin, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, will decide to market a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, a consultant working for the company, is then excluded from the introduction of a new product.
The writer is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used for example to modify the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine returned to his favorite old and forgotten subject, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to settle for 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is remotely classified production from the first years when only 3,000 publishers were produced.
Molezkine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's hard to build an artificial portrait of the buyer, because the writer takes on business as well as a student or professional.
The image of the Journal of Moleskin is that its owners are people of a cosmopolitan, cultivating and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, has today almost a hundred and since 2008, has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and through the FNAC chain to small boutiques in the middle of cities where he could prove his identity.
"We watched the spirit of time and this need for new writing through the stormy development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the Journal of Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zázka", where architects or artists exhibit their journal.
In August, on the occasion of a film festival in Locarn, she also introduced a new recorder reminding Leopard.
Molezkine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook cases ... The brand expands to a wide range of media.
The success that led to envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin history.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of handicapped people are looking for work.
Today, the 15th week is opened for the employment of handicapped people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled persons is still twice as high as the average, 19% compared to 9% for the whole population.
Is it depressing?
"No, according to Éric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, who organizes a week for the employment of handicapped people."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high."
"However, much remains to be done."
It should be said that for unemployed disabled persons there are numerous obstacles to their entry into work.
These are older persons: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a degree and out of 2.3 million high school students there are only 10,000 handicapped.
Finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in handicappeds compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to get back to work and which represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses receive handicapped workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are still unspoken ways of thinking, which certainly develops, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the managers questioned have a "weak level of knowledge of handicapped persons" with a "excessive idea of persons on the driving chair and mental or mental deficiencies".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are far from achieving the objectives of employing 6% of the certified workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, which come from 2008, state equal to 2.6%.
"We are now moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, charged with collecting fees from enterprises that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of "punished" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 more guilty enterprises to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "How lucky is that?"
Before the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens called on Tuesday evening (20h45), they did not hide the pleasure that this friendly game will bring them.
We're not going so far as to write that there's been a mix-up between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other in the Stade de France court, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace with each other.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, the Belgian coach carried only words of praise to his player.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the player of French Lille.
As for the difference between his performance in club matches and national team matches, "it is the same, it justifies."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"It takes me to clear my brand."
Gambling, saved against Romania on Thursday night for this fight against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "light".
You can't ignore the term "joy."
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged from 7 years and in their winning draw in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
That's more because the opposite is Mathieu (Debachy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", recalls.
"We were crucifixing right away."
"The power to play against them is only pleasure!"
Leekens reminded me of the pride.
"Hrost" to fight a fight - a holiday.
"Hrdost" also states in the quality of "joint" that France became a very high-level team a little more than a year after a trauma in the South African city of Knysna."
"Laurent Blanc did a huge piece of work," he sighed.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, a technical football player would like to see it in 2014 on a plane with the French towards... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're actually building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"Be aware of this for the next fight, including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese coach, Paulo Bento, begins with a great optimism a barage against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked realism on their way there.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paula Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese football team, with which it has been in the helm since 2010, is eligible for Euro 2012.
Portugal divides from happiness in fact 90 minutes.
One match left to play and one opponent to fight - Bosnia.
When conscious of Friday's result (0-0) in hell, the Bosnian Zenica seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of superiority, but it was not able to give him such a rare goal that would elevate it.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will step in front of an audience that should create a cauldron there, even though the match is definitely "very balanced", says the optimist, but a sharp thinker Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are quite convinced that we can have the upper hand," said a 40-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of being on Euro 2012", however, relativised Carlos Queiroz' successor.
Undecidable Friday's game in Bosnia forces Portugal to score.
An unshakeable match can suffice the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score out," Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, Portugal will be interested in developing the Bosnian team right from the start of maximum pressure so that "they don't give them time to think."
The good idea, on condition that it turns out to be realistic this time.
