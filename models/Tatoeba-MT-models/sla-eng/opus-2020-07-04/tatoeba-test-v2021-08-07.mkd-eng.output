I gave up.
I grow goods.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like this wine.
I love your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do so.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the queen.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
The iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring it in.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister rip the letter off.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far?
Buddhism Is Religion or Philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are the potatoes calorie?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," the blind man said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat apple or banana?
I got my head back.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should be sorry about them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack up.
I have to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have turned it down.
I showed him my room.
Are you cold out there?
Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is Dadeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I put a slap on him.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a slaughter.
I was sleeping in the phantom.
I slept on a bus.
I cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
Been cleaning snow all day.
Is she a cab driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I hit something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean yes or no?
Is that even a word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that Sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's Tom there?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is it hot coffee?
Is the house ready?
Is it deep?
Is it paid for delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it really diamonds?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Is anybody sitting here?
Is this place free?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his bag?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Did you bring Tom?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Did Tom piss you off?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on looking for a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to get down.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's what I doubted.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you or burn and you're the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Does the freezer still work for you?
Is your head full of straw?
I take advantage of the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about which items to take.
It all makes sense.
Everything looks pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
So, no.
It can't be!
It's up to you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never, never could have happened here.
There's no way he was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That's disappointing.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get better.
Doesn't seem very different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; either way, you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
That's not surprising.
I teach Chinese.
I teach him English.
It's okay. It's okay.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have been created somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
He's losing control.
It happens.
It's cooled down.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy.
It has a sentimental value.
I mean it all day long.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what it's like.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice statement.
I think I'm pretty good at writing.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should check on Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom the money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I've made a mistake.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's brilliant.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box's empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom's a conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's petty.
I think Tom's a cepidan.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's in trouble.
I think Tom's pretentious.
I think Tom's a little touchy.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I believe Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this alone.
I'm thinking about helping me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you need to deal with this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was happening to me.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
So we didn't agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you're gonna have to work your ass off.
So didn't you want the reward?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
So don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you could swim?
So didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts so bad in here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the hat off the toilet.
It's a multifaceted process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll do the job in one day.
It's less humid today than yesterday.
It's not cold.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I handle that?
I'm paying.
It's not coming in.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
He's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked awful.
It looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks delicious.
He looks different.
Seems familiar.
Looks like an egg.
Looks like I had too much to drink yesterday.
Looks like these two are dating again.
Looks like these two have settled down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
You've got me.
It worries me.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe he's gonna quit tonight.
Maybe it's acting weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have made it up to you.
It has to be perfectly symmetric.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was 13 years old.
I told you this was going to get ugly.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I took off.
I'm back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are broken.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally get it.
Probably won't be worth the wait.
It was raining two days ago.
It resulted in major difficulties.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't press.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I'm truly sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
He's ready to go down.
That's classic.
You were a disaster!
It is recommended that you check for any negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medicine you have been prescribed.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
Everything's in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's almost gone.
It's so funny.
Seven o'clock already.
It's 11 o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad concrete doesn't burn.
It's a quick walk.
It's a simple job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a beautiful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They've broken it down.
He just made me feel bad.
It's been raining for a week, about.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
It's extremely warm this week.
It'd be best if you didn't talk that much.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and fooled than to be pessimistic and to be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's a new recruit.
You scared me.
There's nobody here.
It's closing time.
It's cold in here.
It's common knowledge that you're not fond of Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in jail than then run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
Easy to tell.
Looks like I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's evil to swear.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's dressed up.
It's dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be beastly.
It'll get even cooler.
It'll happen soon.
I'm glad to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's okay.
It's getting better.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
She's in great shape.
It's in the basement.
Just guessing.
It's just a question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
I decide, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to wear such gifts.
It's nice to feel needed by someone.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's loud in here.
None of your business!
It's no secret Tom doesn't agree with you.
That doesn't have a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly what happened.
It will not be easy to do so without much help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough reading light here.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
Don't surprise me.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often anyone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds really cool.
That sounds really good.
Our job is to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's stupid.
It's actually quite a lot.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It really sucks.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's cool!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark outside.
He's still on sale.
It's still working.
He hasn't left yet.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's funny how people in the tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat like a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
Time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It is too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
It's so cool.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
It doesn't support this heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom right away.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
No idea.
There's wind.
It's work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water only takes three minutes to rise.
It's been going on all night.
It lasted a lot longer than I thought it would last.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpected eloquent.
I turned the fan on and I pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
It's been a day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was my pleasure to spend the night with a smart, funny, and pretty girl like you.
It was a remarkable experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a hot night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
It was gross.
It was effective.
That was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was all over the night.
It was getting darker.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I had sinned.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It has been proven that dogs that live on dogs jump higher than cats that live on cats.
It was very grand.
That was pretty funny.
It was really cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was breathing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was a tough one.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was stuck on the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was incomprehensible.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
It was very cozy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Butter.
It was worth a shot.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
It's not gonna cost you anything to fix it.
They won't help lies.
That won't help you.
Good work.
It would be very normal for you to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I can explain everything to you.
I need you right away.
I used to hear you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed up.
I've already read it.
I've already written everything that was supposed to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone's always helped me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I already asked them all.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little distracted with something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I've had a lot worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been notified.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was a mess.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was providing help.
I was helping them.
They hired me to find them.
I was kidnapped.
I've lived here for years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been busy enough.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I've been learning French since I was 13 years old.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've seen it before.
I came for them.

You can study here.
You can rest.
You can talk later.
You can't beat me.
You can't call them.
You can't control me, Tom.
You can't deny that.
You can't deny that.
You can't do whatever you want.
You can't fire her.
You can't fire him.
Now you can't help us.
You can't leave a baby alone.
You can't leave Boston today.
You can't let that settle.
You can't marry Tom.
There's nothing you can prove.
You can't sell it.
You can't sit there.
You can't take that away from me.
You can't treat me like this.
You can use my car.
You can use this car.
You can use this pen.
You're quick to receive data.
You're cooking turkey with bulbs.
It's possible you're wrong.
You could have refused.
You'd make a great mother.
You'd better ask them first.
Find them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You would've done the same thing in my place.
You've done a bad job.
You did a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, right?
You already did.
You did your best.
You don't need to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
You're sick, aren't you?
Do you happen to have a key?
You don't know who else for how long.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
You know my bitch.
You don't know anything.
Dream you know.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You shouldn't be present for this.
You don't have to go.
There's no need to panic.
You don't have to dress anything up.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do anything that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You're entitled to a phone call.
You go pick up Tom, then come back.
You hit one.
You're wrong, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair's a crowbar.
You hate us, don't you?
You have a great job.
You're having a bit of a conscience, aren't you?
You have a habit I don't like.
You have small breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You've been a great mentor to me.
You've been busy.
You have nice eyes.
You have many different kinds of people here.
I give you my respect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You don't have a preconceived mind, do you?
You've never seen one like that, have you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a gift.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You have to sit down.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
You can't lose your condition.
You have to try, Tom.
You've got a lot of beautiful lips.
You have very permeable eyes.
You just heard.
You just got back from vacation.
You almost missed it.
You almost missed Tom.
You stay out of this.
Kids, stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than it seems.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a fast learner.
You will learn to value your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom escape.
You want your life, don't you?
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be known over time.
You'll feel better.
You're gonna get yourself a copy.
You're gonna feel better.
You'll get them back.
You'll get wrinkles.
You'll try, won't you?
You're going with me and a dot!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You're going to have to study harder next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a ticket to take a bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never take you to that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when it's time.
She looked beautiful.
You look familiar.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look really good.
You look sad.
You look imaginary.
You look very handsome, Tom.
You've earned something.
You gave your word.
You're making me nervous.
Maybe you'll need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad to slow down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
I'm sure it's been a lot easier for you.
You must have jumped.
You must be so proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show up first.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You have to barter the child.
You can't give up.
You've got to get over the difficulties.
You have to learn valuables.
You need a friend.
You need a good woman.
You should buy some sugar.
You should do it somewhere else.
You need to make him listen.
You need to grow up and mature a little.
You have to help her.
I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to make this work.
You didn't ask why.
He didn't give us a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
You should go to a dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You're paying me very well.
You chose well.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It went red.
He was running as fast as he could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints have upset me.
Your transgressions have dishonored the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are tempting, but we're fine.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real human being.
You're acting weird.
You're Brooke.
You're a cheater.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.
You're all cowards.
You're all the same.
You're really good at this.
But you lied to her.
You really need a shrink.
You really should have let me call a cab.
You're always tired.
You're a moron.
You're nothing.
You're a pig.
You're a prisoner.
You're a racist.
You're such a nerd.
You're smart.
You're a discerning man.
You're a wise man.
You're mean.
You're busy, aren't you?
You're capable, but you're confusing.
You're brave, aren't you?
You're ugly.
You're unorganized.
You're mean and repulsive.
You're experienced.
You're right.
You're beautiful.
You're free to go.
You're gay.
You're gonna need help.
You're gonna need this.
You're doing great.
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
You're hurting me.
You don't tell me.
You're impressive.
Now you're in charge.
You're in power.
You're incompetent.
You're influential.
You took my place.
You're in no danger.
You're interesting.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
You've got something on your mind.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
You're magnificent.
You're making Tom nervous.
You're my date.
You're not my friend.
You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You're not gonna find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can go now.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You don't have alcohol anymore.
You've got too much to do.
You're specific.
You're part of our team.
You're a pessimist.
You're poor.
You're predictable.
You're a small town.
You're perfectly safe.
You're really sweet.
You're doing great.
You're very lucky.
You're laughing.
You're funny.
You're rude.
You're in trouble!
I'm very attracted to you.
You're so dramatic.
You're very helpful.
You're very passionate.
You're so negative.
You're a little rude.
You're kind of rough.
How much money you're in.
You're so talented.
You're stronger than Tom.
You're such a nerd.
What a pig you are.
You need to help them.
You're teasing me.
You're terrible.
You're the only one who can smile at me.
You're the only one who's ever met Tom.
You're the owner.
You're the prisoner.
You're the problem.
You're weak.
You've ruined your whole life.

You're disgusting.
You're so smart.
You're very good with kids.
You're very lonely.
You're very direct.
You're very bold.
You're very cut off.
You can wait here.
You're among friends.
You're with Tom, right?
You misjudged her.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're lying, Tom.
Your eyebrows look strange.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You squeeze too hard when you shake hands.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
It's a good memory.
Your moon is coming back.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is difficult.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your pronunciation is probably correct.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith sucks.
Your role here is so important.
Your shelf is full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are pretty hot.
All your things are here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent's unlocked.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you were gonna text me tonight, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You seem to know the answer.
You look like you're cold.
Looks like you've got an infection.
You seem to find it hard to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You need to ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Make sure you don't overdo it.
You should be happy for them.
You should be proud.
You should eat less red meat.
You should eat more.
You should feel flattered.
You need a good night's sleep.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.
You should go help him.
You should get to bed early.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
You should pay your rent in advance.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
You should try it.
You should try this.
You should try writing respect.
You should have asked her first.
You should wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
You smell like shit.
You sound like it made you feel better.
You sound very sure.
You've sewn your ankle.
You're beautiful.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are so cute together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston so much.
You're tired.
They got you drunk.
You've been in a car accident, but you'll be fine.
We missed you.
It was of great use to us.
You're right from the start.
You were making white again!
You bought Mary something.
It struck me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
You overdid her!
You've got a rash.
You're worried enough.
You got me all wrong.
I promise.
You do now, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You blew up Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been delaying this for too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
You were lucky to have survived the attack.
You made a mistake.
It's not that you weren't right.
You were right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
You were great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the picture.
You'll do as I say.
You'll find your toys and your books.
You won't need that.
You won't make it.
You're not gonna win.
You worry too much about him.
I don't want you to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
