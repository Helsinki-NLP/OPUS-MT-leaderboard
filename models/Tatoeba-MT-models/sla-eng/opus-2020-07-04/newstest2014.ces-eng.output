The black box in your car?
While American road designers are working hard to find money for repairs to the decaying highway network, many begin to see the solution in a small black box that easily fits into the toolboard of your car.
The devices that monitor every mile that the motorist drives, and which transmits this information to the authorities, are the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and the State Planning Offices to renovate the outdated funding system of the U.S. capital roads.
Usually the slow development of motorways has suddenly stimulated intense debate and the emergence of various societies.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbyed for the government to use these small boxes, which would record captured kilometers and perhaps even where you're going - and then use this information to build tax rates.
Tea party's scared.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't match whether to continue, some states don't expect anything.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for a mile of the road on which he is going.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"It is not a matter of where we can choose," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Association of State Administration in Southern California, which plans to start monitoring the miles taken for each California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
That's what this technology is for.
The fact is that the Road Trust Fund, financed by taxes paid by the Americans at the pumping stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The cars are driving a lot more miles per gallon.
Federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise tax by only one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system paying for a few miles.
"From a long-term perspective, this appears to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it the user charge according to the number of kilometres taken.
It is no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change drivers' behaviour patterns, which, for example, can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gases.
California designers look at this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But the Republican Bill Shuster (Pensylvania), chairman of the Transport Committee, said that he also sees this as the most functional long-term alternative.
Representatives of the free market from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for miles.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of the strategy in the Reason organization.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to pay for a kilometer.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project, which would include about 10,000 cars.
However, the management of the House of Representatives has rejected the proposal and has done so because of the concerns of the rural legislators representing the population, whose daily lives often mean to target many kilometres for work outside the city.
Nevertheless, several states and cities are moving ahead on their own.
The worst is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the State tax for miles taken, instead of taxes on gasoline.
The failure has already completed the pilot project.
New York is looking into the project.
Illinois is working to a limited extent on trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, is not just a advocate.
In Nevada, where the equipment was recently equipped with about 50 cars of volunteers, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
"The concerns about the follow-up of Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs strategy and operation management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the test project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to build a huge heavy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to the records of day-to-day departures and arrivals of individuals.
Misdemeanours are among the few countries that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to monitor how many kilometres the vehicle will take, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hon brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was originally not involved in an action to assist the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market with legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they were driving.
But this device, which it's trying, attracts the attention of road network designers because it doesn't use GPS and only provides a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you do not follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, a number of major errors occurred.
They're a lot cheaper and less touchy ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they may not take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometres of all the inhabitants of the country.
In other places they hope that a prudent public will come to this concept if the device is able to do more, not less.
In the city of New York, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay parking hours in addition to providing insurance according to miles taken and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic congestion.
"Motorists will be willing to participate in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city projection document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know that all discussions about paying for a kilometer are not just a huge problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Committee for Transport in the Bay of San Francisco say that Congress could solve the problem with a bankrupt road trust fund very easily by increasing gas taxes.
A one-off or one-year tax could be imposed on a hybrid or other driver who does not need a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical operations when it is enough to marry aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Affairs Committee.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
Sobotka negotiates for the ČSSD.
Social democracy is raging, the people and the baboons are talking together, and they are preparing for a common process.
If the social democrats get tired within a few weeks, they will sit at the table with perfectly integrated partners, who will put a complete list of requirements, including ministerial posts, on the table.
The ambassadors of the ČSSD will then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod on a greasy minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka came across for the first time in four days when he was carrying on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political tempo and mainly force convicted liars to resign.
Only he, the other members of the team, confirmed by the negotiator behind the party, will be allowed until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CCE).
I apologized to the Grimm members and now to the citizens.
He's not supposed to lie, in his personal life, or in his public life.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hasek said after discussing the most difficult governance of social democracy.
He added that he didn't count on the First Vice-President's post.
"I will announce my decision on 10 November at the UV," Hasek said.
Similarly, Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and head of the MEP's club Jerome Tajc spoke.
However, he pointed out that he was elected just two days ago.
Both Members then declared that they would do everything to make the 50-member CSSD sound one vote.
To the absurd theatre he put the crown of Michal Hasek in the sentence: "I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to her mark and I have respected the decision of the party authorities."
Or another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget when he called for Sobotk's resignation and was expelled from the negotiating team that August's UVV had 57 percent dreamt that Bohuslav Sobotka was a candidate for the Prime Minister's party?
Chief ČSSD, however, made a powerful enemy army on the next Sunday.
Its opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a variety of gossip and fams, eventually recalling the real mistakes of Sobotk's political career.
He's gonna wash his underwear hard, there's gonna be signs of a dark alliance between Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotek Wing.
The friendship of Bohuslav Sobotka and influential lawyer Radek Pokorny will be discussed.
Disputes erupt in the South Moravian or Moravian Silesian ČSSD organization.
The words of Ostrava's prime minister and Sobotk's ally Peter Kainar are warning: "I have signed the Charter of 77 so that the idiots do not rule the earth."
If the UV meeting this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to give up their functions ritually.
The traitors will sprinkle their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD will then end with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrh.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Soča: Communication with the Russians is demanding
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he breathes deeply, "It's difficult."
Cooperation with the Olympic team in Sochi 2014 is a little more complicated, according to Martin the Doctor.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on essential matters, not so much anymore.
For three months, perhaps we will wait for them to add to us how individual villages will be officially marked so that we can do a whole range of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
They keep communicating in a number of ways.
Is there an Olympic village already built?
But it's not a disaster anymore.
A month ago, we walked in empty rooms.
Well, luckily, the houses are worth it.
What do you mean they're empty?
Do you need finished floors?
Just basic concrete, that's what the situation was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there's a danger that by January 26th we'll be there as a front, he'll still feel glue.
And if they didn't, what would it be?
You think President Putin would drive an army out there?
That's how it's gonna work.
Just so it isn't that Olympic village = the Postimkin village.
Rather, they threaten to fail, for example, to adjust the way, to complete the details.
Maybe they'll have their way in such a state that we'll have to take the London Games with us.
But I believe they're going to put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, even though the number changes depending on the nomination criteria.
Maybe the robbers are going to ride in that three-way.
There is also no doubt about Martin Sablíková's speedboat, but it is also in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, unless nothing happens, I should be there until January 26th.
As the houses in the Olympic village look, we know.
We even measured some things by meter so that we wouldn't just believe in sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a common agenda in terms of communication with the Organising Committee in Soča.
Putin promised an ecological olytic olympiad, the plan to throw him a giant secret dump.
Winter sports fans are already cutting meters until the start of the Olympic Games in Soča, others are looking for more and more anxiety at their preparation.
The Russian Olympics, even if they start in February, face another scandal.
The Russians do not seem to be able to fulfil the promise that the preparation and execution of the games will not be disruptive in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be headed in four months.
After the Vancouver Olympiad, the Russians had a very high latrine, and Canadian games were recorded in the history of the Olympics as being the least environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "zero waste" has long been taken for himself.
Reporters of the AP agency discovered a huge landfill of construction material last week in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
Then, in August, environmentalists found the landfill full of building materials, tires, cans, and insulating foams, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have disappeared and the landfill has disappeared.
Only for a moment.
Last week, reporters got a look at a dump the size of three football playgrounds.
She is not the only one in such places created several, described the British letter The Times.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly, are operating on the site, which builds about 60 kilometres between Soča Airport and the sports resort.
A company that had already crammed 280 billion rubles was led by one of Vladimir Jakunin's close-up Putin associates.
In August, the railways defended that the landfill had been founded by a subcontractor.
But the locals are desperate.
According to the residents of Achstyru, everyone has been driving trucks full of waste materials for three months and a night.
According to experts, the waste is threatening to contaminate the local river Mzimt, other streams, and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates the juicy water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimaev of EWNC, a British letter from the environmental non-profit organization.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organisational committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
To compare: Sochi games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing went to 43 billion.
Last year’s games in London cost only 19 billion and the mentioned Vancouver Nine Bills.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and concerns as to whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working on the sport and infrastructure exhibition.
Last month, one of the workers wrote his mouth to protest that he didn't get paid two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers grappled with a new law prohibiting the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with their parents, the new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates received the assignment to design a house on a plot that is located on the corner of two streets, with the property being considered somewhat.
It was further claimed that two generations would live in the house that would want to live together, but everyone should have their own clear space.
The younger couple needed an extra little office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly weighing ground.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"When making a proposal, we respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected several ways through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," designers explain.
The motherhood of the parents is at the level of the garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories weigh.
Individual parts of the house are easily identifiable from outside, which differs from the final shape of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was formed by panels made of boards, the part where the office is framed is white and the remaining elements remained in pure concrete construction without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glass, making the interior of the house very connected to the exterior.
The household of parents, the kitchen, the dining room and the living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that has great meaning for the family.
The connection of the interior to the exterior underlines the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the house of a young couple.
A young couple enter the house by the main entrance to the hall and then climb down the stairs into their own space.
The stairs are the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall through them cascadingly.
That's what the architects were trying to distinguish the house from the others and print something unique.
The household of the young couple is treated as one open space with kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
Only a glass wall with a sliding door separates it from the terrace.
Living zone with food and kitchen in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that moves freely onto the terrace from where it is nice view of the Gulf of Tokyo.
The office itself in the highest floor is covered in a clean combination of white and black.
The staircase is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house by the main entrance, they find themselves in the lobby, and then they climb up the stairs.
Defend academic freedom, this applies to Zeman and ODS.
Repeatedly, in recent months, I have called for open letters from students, educators, and heads of secondary and higher schools in several regions to defend academic freedom from the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman at the schools.
I've been meeting with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who rejected the lecture of the honourable President of the SPOZ-Zemanovci during the pre-election period, even received a reprieve in the form of no invitation to the celebration of the Czech Republic's national holiday.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who have not been so brave and have been able to visit Miloš Zeman: High Technical Teaching in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, High School of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice to continue promoting politics at universities.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrotechnics and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and in addition it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same as if you've stayed, for example, in the position of mayor of a smaller city.
Would you like to join the ČSSD heitmans, who are simultaneously indignant to the function of a Member and a Heitman and as well as to degrade both professions?
You tell people that you can handle both of these demanding functions in the left rear.
I know, we have here an example of Michal Hasek, who can even handle a few dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not exactly the example of the person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Fraňková, who preferred to leave the post of honour, so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the function of dean is that you violate the apolitical nature of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubic ODS sees your current effect on both posts as an advantage for the University.
"Your" school, however, will be able to help you without being a dean.
I think that a similar opinion like me and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students as well.
So consider your resignation and keep your face on the line.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count for you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long.
They don't put chemistry into it.
More than 1,000 tons of sour cabbage want to be produced in the next few months in the Hamé food group of the Slavská Fruta Kunovice.
Season started here in October, and it'll take about six months.
He's been producing a healthy delicacy here since 1925 in a traditional way, that's by snoring right in big tanks.
In modern industrial times, it's a rarity.
Our employees are on a shift of almost ten kilometres.
Each of the ten tanks includes fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, the completion of one lasts three shifts," said the director of the Slovak Fruta David Kladroba.
Head cabbages bring directly from their fields farmers mainly from Ostrožsk and Břeclavska to the premises of the company.
Employees of Fruta then cleans up the vegetables, removes the skeletons and throws them into the crucible.
From there, the already cut cabbage falls into pools with a six-foot depth, in which the hookers dressed in white clothes and shavings work tirelessly.
That's how they squeeze out unwanted air.
The last polished layer of cabbage will be covered with a sail and heavy water.
"The green slicer then matures six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of acidifying agents," said Director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to domestic production, the individual layers of workers shed salt and cumin.
After blooming, cabbage travels to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet acidic infusion into sachets or jars and undergoes sterilization.
Hamé adds oxygen to the domestic and Slovak markets in particular.
In some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada, he is also interested in him.
Snowden is willing to “co-operate” with Germany in connection with US monitoring
Edward Snowden, a snitcher from American intelligence services, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German Ambassador Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the opportunity to testify in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, who handed over to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Despite the result of my efforts has been proveably positive, my government continues to hold the opposition as a fugitive and is trying to criminalize political statements by heavy lawsuits that do not allow room for defence.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
The tension between the US and Germany began to rise when there was a claim that the NSA was listening to Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads a parliamentary panel that oversees the reporting, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness "without exposing itself to danger and completely destroying relations with the US", this should be done.
Mr Sträbel, a member of Parliament on the German side of the Greens, published a photo on his twitter contribution with Mr Snowden.
On their way to Russia, two German journalists accompanied him.
Mr Sträbele said that according to a former NSA attorney, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need to be assured that he would be "safe", said a member of parliament.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he was facing a tough and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the reaction of the world to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens across and high officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the findings of the inexcusable system of universal monitoring for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, “until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Killing us is sorry, but we're innocent, the leaders of the Red Khmer Rouge defend themselves.
Nuon Chea was number two in the hierarchy of the Khmer Rouge and Khieu Samphan was the former head of state.
The governments of the Khmer Rouge, which between 1975 and 1979 relied on a mixture of Maoism and Nationalism, lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population of that time.
In 2010, the commander of the notorious S-21 prison was awarded the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia a life sentence.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and did not know what the actual extent of killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore hit and corrected the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
You really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he had never ordered the staff of the Khmer Rouge "to treat people badly or kill them to deny them food or commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, all the Cambodian people," he said.
The 15-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the regime of the Khmer Rouge, told AFP that he could not accept an apology from Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"Only one wants to be exonerated."
"She doesn't care about the other," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his devices wouldn't have killed," she added, adding that the leaders of the Khmer Rouge were "worse than monsters".
The "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer Rouge Ieng Sara, who died in March this year, was also to appear before the court.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, found an incompetent trial in September 2012 for dementia.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to pay for manual luggage
The airliner plans to charge up to USD 100 for the storage of the guide luggage on board during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a charge of up to $100 for a handbag and USD 2 for coffee or soda, although in their notice Wednesday they said that passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new charge for the manual luggage relates to luggage in the upper storage space, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge 25 USD if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 USD if passengers with payment wait until they arrive at the gate.
The speaker of Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the 100-dollar fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would hate to charge this fee," she said.
Air companies began to pay for the first and second baggage in 2008.
Travelers tried to avoid these charges and dipped into the handbags hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often no space in this space.
Charges are one way of teaching travellers to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really isn't to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is becoming more and more difficult.
Travellers who buy tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier’s gate can bring a luggage for which nothing will pay, while the other passenger in front will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said that the websites and removal procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new guarantee fee will not be valid until summer, but the date has not yet been fixed.
Travellers often complain about luggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who require it should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see another baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover air traffic costs after years of loss.
But most of them did not pay for manual luggage.
Spirit Airlines, as the first company to pay for its manual luggage three years ago and another low-cost company Allegiant Air, followed the example later.
The only company that also has such charges is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport advisor Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors the additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the charge for Spirit’s manual luggage would amount to USD 50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when the passengers met with an unusual charge of Spirit for a manual luggage.
"Getting on the plane was the most funky thing I have ever seen in my air career," he said.
I expected to see teeth scrape and arguments at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the entrance was in the manhole."
The Frontier also applies coffee, tea, soda and juice after the Spirit model.
Frontier stated that passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and coffee will be added free of charge.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly attempted to introduce a charge for drinks, but after complaints by passengers of that time seven months later, no other significant airline had given up and imitated it.
Frontier's latest move to pay for the manual luggage, if the passengers do not buy the flight directly from this airline, it is her last attempt to direct customers directly to her website.
Air companies pay Internet travellers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to take passengers directly from them, rather than through Internet travel agencies.
Frontier, however, went the further in this area.
In September, she began giving customers who purchased only half of the miles in the framework of the Loyalty Programme.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for a runaway mile to 25 percent of the miles from that road.
So the journey with Frontier is 1000 miles long, bought through an Internet travel agency means the reward of 250 million.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in his hometown of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and lose money.
According to the financial results presented at the centre by the company partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The company Republic is trying to solve Frontier's financial problems by selling this airline.
For the collapse of the NSA website, it does not blame hackers, but “internal error”
The Secret National Security Agency said last Friday that her website dropped for a few hours last week because of an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some said on the Internet.
“NSA.gov sites were not available for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates”, the spy agency said in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claim that the accident was caused by an attack by the DDoS (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening online server sensors noticed that the NSA websites did not work for at least six hours, and the sites are still unavailable to some users.
Previously, NSA spokesmans at ABC News reported that internal sensitive networks of agencies were not ‘no’ at all threatened.
The speaker said that no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for the removal of NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overloaded and the site falls.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to enter the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret agency of the NSA, which had once received a nickname No such agency, has become the centre of public attention and the area of ominous criticisms of the removal of NSA secret files from the Agency and their exposure to the disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden in the last months.
This growing controversy surrounding the Agency prompted earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Bombardier's profit has fallen due to a drop in supplies and orders
The Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier reported on Thursday a 15 per cent decrease in net profits due to a smaller number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier also did not publish any data on its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the start-up test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times and the question arose as to whether the test phase was going well.
The results did not meet the estimates and stock at the Toronto Stock Exchange dropped by 8 percent.
State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced Thursday's rating from "high yield" to "sector performance" with the expectation that the storm will experience limited growth in the next quarter or two.
"The smaller deliveries of aircraft we expected mostly, the profit margin in the area of transport has greatly disappointed us," Doerksen said in a report to the clients.
As the test programme continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that a market failure will increase towards this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will be streaming into the lower market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was discovered in March and, after several months of delay, took place in September on the first flight.
However, the number of mandatory orders from CSeries aircraft is modest 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and savings on the costs of this aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director, Pierre Beaudoin, expected that, when the first aircraft was put into commercial use, Bombardier would reach its target of 300 mandatory orders.
Managers also assured the analysts and the media Thursday that the programme was proceeding according to the plan.
‘The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected,’ said Beaudoin in a conference call and noted that the ground and software updates were planned during the aircraft's departure.
Every producer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate first year and then focus on updates and we did it.
That's what's gonna happen during the whole flight program.
According to Bombardier, the other of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and not long after.
However, analysts are sceptical that the first customer could start operating CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier argues that it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the following months.
"This slow pace of flight tests – although in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – will likely strengthen our view that putting into service will be moved to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
From $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share, was lost in the third quarter ending on 30 September.
The adjusted revenue per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover has marginally dropped from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft producer reported that he had only delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter of the year before 57 aircraft.
Clean orders dropped from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the air division formed 32.9 billion on September 30, which did not change until December 31.
"The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low receipt of orders and the total market state failed us," Beaudoin said.
Profits in the aviation industry decreased by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that the yield in this division increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled contracts in transport amounted to 32.6 billion on September 30, which is marginal growth on December 31.
The profit margin in the transport division has been affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Managers indicated that new views would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced the arrival of Google's Financial Director Patrick Pichetet, decreased by $4.5 per cent on Thursday afternoon to $4.33.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor to Bombardier, announced on Thursday a 10 % decline in quarterly profits.
A cocaine lawyer who warned the mob against a police investigation is in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to transmit information to the king of the underworld to Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
The top attorney who informed the drug mobster of a large police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out, he was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had to report sensitive information to the head of the underworld about investigating his drug smuggling activities after becoming a suspect of cocaine use.
A lawyer whose nickname was “Bash” and who was celebrated as the best lawyer was arrested in 2011 after a police investigation by Scarborough, who was represented in previous drug proceedings.
Police saw Sarborough (32), as he left at a law firm in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just at dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society, three bags of cocaine.
Based on the tests in which the traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of class A.
During the eight months period, from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were then monitored in the context of a large investigation into heroin and cocaine trading in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After police detained heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million during a series of raids, along with GBP 200,000 in cash, 32 others ended up in prison.
Ditta (42) gave information to criminals out of fear that it would come about his dependence on cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works with Forbes Solicitors law firm based in Blackburn, experienced a shameful time before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of defending justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During his earlier hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
Lawyer collapsed after a police investigation into Scarborough revealed that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditt in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival in Ditt's house, and saw him place drugs clean 60 percent under a lawyer basket in a black golf glove.
Then there was Scarborough with Ditto, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park for dinner in a regular phone call.
The lawyer returned home where he had found drugs, and nine interviews took place between the two persons.
The court heard that traces of class A drugs were found in his hair, wallet and his credit cards and that Ditta was “a regular user” of cocaine.
Ditta was arrested later, but he denied the use of cocaine and said that he spoke to a suspect dealer because he was his client and argued that their conversation fell under "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to get several credit cards out of it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
At a police hearing, he said that he was operating an office at both his home and his workplace, and that he was also visited at home by clients for work.
However, the court heard that after the key arrest, he had contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware of the fact that he must not violate the law than a legal representative in the criminal area.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his legal representation and of getting too close to a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer who's supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal relationship of a client lawyer.
The police investigation dreamed as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring a good reputation to his profession, but he insulted her.
He has drawn too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and has allowed his independence to be violated.
Ditta refused the offence and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I would like to pass on information to Mr Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, but I would have done so immediately."
After hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta himself became a criminal at the time he began to collect drugs from organized criminals.
His dependence on cocaine has made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organised crime groups, who have given him the task of gathering valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and should build trust and trust in the public and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind a cloak of his profession.
A serious and organised crime unit in Lancashire led an investigation against Mr. Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted in three cases of possession of cocaine and now for obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring a criminal to trial.
This case should serve all criminals as a warning that no one is out of the hands of the law.
We'll find you and face our trials.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of association for the supply of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five persons involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online conversation about himself, in which he said that his dream work would be legally represented by clients from a death cell block in America, as a guest for dinner he would like Mohammed Ali and, as a motivation for work, set out the inequality.
He was negotiating a government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of John Kasal have sent against Babylon.
In the election of fourteen members, only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of ANO.
But they enter negotiations on government with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to guess the outline of possible coalitions, there is Jan Kasal - a man who, as a human being, had the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andre Babiš don't have that kind of matador on their side.
Perhaps this time it will be a reminder of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a brand-new party.
"The experience was then minimal," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press outraged by the controversial media law
"It is a terrible report and it is on the spot to ask what prevents Parliament from simply deleting tomorrow's independence from the judiciary," the newspaper said, considering the draft law to be anti-constitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, including Capital FM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new Media Tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended hand of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us out, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star Journal, the bill actually gives the government "full control over the media" and the Standard newspaper state that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "seized a hard blow" and criticises the bill's proposal as "serious".
Approval of the draft law comes in the midst of a number of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately following the September attack of the Islamic shooter at the Westgate shopping centre.
The Kenyan media turned on their anger when they broadcast a security camera on which troops were allegedly robbing the luxury goods store at the scene of the attack.
The police director reacted by having two journalists and a media director call for questioning, but the call was later withdrawn after press pressure.
According to the new draft law, media companies can be punished by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to one million, together with the risk of being "disposed" or denied official journalistic accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is also a fine enough to eliminate most radio stations”.
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what the Kenyan “living blogosphere” is called.
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described Kenyan media as the key source of the system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it in politics, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back into hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been targets of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of abolishing the cuts ordered by the national payroll agency and renewing their fat salaries to around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, which are so among the highest in the world.
They have to fight, they know young Czechs.
Most of them don't even know what interest they're paying.
Still more Czechs put money aside.
However, they do not reach out to champions in the spa in the region.
The biggest money on the side is saved by the Rakušanas, who will spend an average of 181 euros a month.
A little more than the Czechs are going to be spores and people in Slovakia.
This results from the Erste Savings Barometer survey in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of overseers is improving, and two thirds of those questioned plan to put aside more money.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of a number of cruisers, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little of the savings products.
Almost every other Serbian, for example, will eat at home "under the pillow" according to the survey.
In the country this year, the number of those who spend more money a month has risen.
Every month, between 1,000 and 2.5 thousand crowns were laid down by 26 percent of the respondents, five percent more this year.
The average monthly allowance in the annual comparison fell slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension access.
This favours 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to estimate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, there is a decline in the popularity of the construction dispute, and interest in the investment funds has also fallen significantly over the previous year.
You're already using only 16 percent of the respondents, while last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
Research has also shown that although people consider it important to compete, most of them do not know what their income on individual products is.
Especially young people under the age of 30 don't know how their money is transferred.
On the contrary, the best knowledge of the yield of its saved money has the oldest group of respondents, with 73 percent of the people over 50 years of age.
In the international comparison of the Erste Czech group, they lead the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44% of people.
Followed by Slovaks and Rakušanas with 12% distance.
UN celebrates new goals in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work immediately on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Prior to the UN summit on sustainable development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDG, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said overnight at the summit that it is now time to “lift over national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
SDGs will build on the progress achieved in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and fulfil our vision of sustainable development goals, which builds on the success of the MDG.
Concerns about the security of Mozambique escalate due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machely, the Mosambican founder's president, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputa to bring peace to a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Out of fear for the future, she replaced her country's business clothes with a t-shirt decorated with the inscription “Require Security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the City of Independence in the capital.
For two weeks there were reports of conflicts between the government and the Renamo side, some of the worst conflicts since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious insurgent movement, originally supported by the Belarusian government in Rhodesia, and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilise the independent government of that country.
After the peace accord in 1992, he became the opposition party.
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that an open conflict will erupt again in the country, but recent events have plagued foreign investors and locals.
At stake is a rapidly growing economy, because the discovery of large coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the north-west can, over the next few years, bring more than $50 billion to investment by companies such as the Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, the Italian Eni and the American Anadarko.
The ruling party of Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tension created.
The Renamo Party argues that the government has sparked the last conflicts by attacking their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional bastion of the Renamo Party on 17 September.
The violent attack on the former rebels then culminated when the government forces attacked the base of the Renamo party and attempted to kill Afons Dlakam, leader of the group, spoke to the Financial Times spokesman Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government is accusing of triggering the Renamo conflicts because they say it attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to ease the fear of instability.
Mr. Guebuza told the French press office AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dlakama saw himself as a “threater” who wanted to use “anything he had left to try to prove that the government could direct its own decisions”.
Like Frelima, Renamo says they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew when Mr Mazangy's words were quoted as saying that Renamo's party was departing from the 1992 Peace Agreement.
The letter FT said that he meant that the party to Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have made to ease the tension between these parties, immersed in a number of fights this year, only a few.
It is a flower between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dlakama), said a lecturer at the Open University and an expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which has been seeking electoral change, has already expressed its view that it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort to win benefits and financial gains from the government.
Since 1992, Renamo's voting share has declined, while the newest party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza – which will end the second term of office next year – wants to destroy democracy in this country.
"If the democratic system wants more parties, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace, because it does not want to leave the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what possibilities the Renamo side has, but it has carried out a sweeping terrorist attack on police stations and on vehicles on a key road between north and south.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira is, the port to which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely when exporting coal.
In June, Rio stopped the use of the railway for about a week when the Renamo side threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to express himself to the question of whether Renamo would reverse his threat.
Renamo wanted to "guard the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good", Mazanga said.
Unstableness has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"People think that the country's responsibility for the future lies exclusively with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
"No one cares either Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for the way of life, ” says the author.
The stories about the Thór can show that “threat power cannot be equal to clever cunning, ” while articulous legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many myths “would be too wild for schooling, too scandalous, and in some cases too lewd," said Crossley-Holland, who conspired for a careful selection of works of corresponding age.
"I think it is great that myths and folk creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been playing this plan for 20 years.
He added that "open teaching" authors and teachers are in the context of the closed stories with the "silver" message for children as a "button switch".
Crossley-Holland, who translated from English the epos Beowulf and who also writes the Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Batteries, says: “You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you keep them for yourself.”
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is a need for some feeling of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended with a happy day, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly defined.
The old truth is, it's better to show it than to describe it.
The Brno Star will take visitors to the universe in a new digital clock.
At first glance, it is obvious that the large planetarium hall has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can dive into the new comfortable seats and the projection area has arrived above their heads with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, there are further smaller projectors scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of Brno Starry Jiří Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image of several projectors does not overlap, but gives a full impression.
"The volume of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of classic personal computers," noted technicians from the starry Tomáš Hladík.
The digitarium can spell out a particularly realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or ocean floor.
The viewers will see themselves in the middle of the universe or the brain of man.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
Starry management plans to present purchased shows and its own creation in the O.R.
There's two shows on the show since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People learn about cosmonaut training, they fly into space, they turn on centrifuge, and then they see examples of how the demanding conditions of astronauts in space are facing.
The second show is for children and has the name Magic cliff - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells a story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the explosion of the nearby volcano.
The whole digital room cost about 50 million crowns, which paid mainly to the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the starry city also contributed less money from its budget.
Project area cost ten million crowns, projector twelve million.
"The rest swallowed audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the superstar passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška 25 to 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've been studying 11 thousands of Inserates!
We know where they want you to work!
In November of last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 ads offering jobs, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet therefore becomes the most important media for publicising job offers.
As early as 2005, when the survey was carried out for the first time, 26 percent of it was.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), about 60 percent settled.
acclaration of the work options in itself, according to the analysis, reflects a significant amount of the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of public adverts in the period of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25 900 advertisements were published in the same period, less than half in 2012.
The offer of job positions on the Internet is oriented to a more useful, in particular a more qualified group of professions.
On the contrary, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including the workers, said the author of the analysis, Pavlín Šťastnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies with both media.
On the Internet, adverts looking for managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts were involved.
The position of programmers or heads of small businesses was only on the internet.
In the day-to-day press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representations belong mainly to professional and labour professions.
Of course, education is among the most frequently mentioned requirements expressed by employers through an offer.
Other areas under surveillance included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for foreign language knowledge was reported in three percent of adverts, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only two percent of the ads, employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The claims for 'calcular grammativity' appeared in 40 percent of the ads (in the daily press in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practices in the field were required in 54 percent of the ads.
The requirements of practice are all connected to qualified professions.
This is mainly the production manager and the other head of staff.
In the case of working professions it is mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, completed by the author of the study Jiří Tillner.
Employees also mention in half their adverts the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most often required skills, communication skills have long emerged in the first place in advertising.
Furthermore, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of New York's comedy festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is a place where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variable artist Frank Fray, who worked as chairman of the celebrations at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes to the people gathered by interviewing.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York comedy festival.
The festival founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than 60 performances in small clubs and big theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the point that they are too big to play at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the “Stand Up for Heroes” (standing for heroes), the annual comedy benefit performances at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform alongside others.
As the festival expanded, so did the comedy world.
Several comedians from this year's festival came from unconventional channels, such as shows in smaller radio and television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has climbed with his sitcom (the village of the spicy “League” on the fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the program “Saturday night live” and “Parks and recreation”, but the most famous was the rapidly spreading series of videos “Marcel the shell with shoes on”.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly identifiable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, angry, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest pullers of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful TV and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he organized a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held in Town Hall in the centre of Manhattan.
"This town is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the alley between the two buildings and he says, "Man, if I lose all my money, I might live here."
The oil price went down to $96 per barrel.
On Friday, the price of oil continued to decline, as the high stock concerns balanced a report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-rich manufacturing sector.
The US oil indicator for December morning supplies dropped in European electronic trading on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
Thursday was a 39 - cent decline, with 5.8 percent falling for the month of October.
Wealthy oil supplies in the past few weeks have put a strain on the price.
The Ministry of Energy announced on Wednesday that US supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production prompted a higher demand that showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery would continue to grow, which after the previous two weak decades rose to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter.
Roba Brent, an indicator for international oil used also by American refineries, dropped 26 cents on the London International Trade Exchange at $108.58 a barrel.
No way, Mr. Hashk.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that we don't.
The pressure must be put on Martin Hasek to get rid of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already disappearing.
Martin Hasek defends himself with the promise he made, but everyone and politicians in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that the politician has (Mr. Babish has even the material one, but the question is whether they are politicians).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He's not apologizing in politics, he's stepping down in politics.
Mr. Hashk, if you mean it well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, if you have not just lied - here you see how difficult it is with lying), you will leave politics alone as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakness, one whose words and deeds cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, be a mistake person or a life-form.
It may seem unfair to you when I address you only, but you are a leader and they are only mistaken sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to fold your ears for a while, regroup your powers, sit down the shame and then attack again, but that's how partisans or traitors behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes a leader, an alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The Court of Justice has blocked regulations concerning the arrest and search of persons by police department in NY
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked a court order requiring changes to the suspension and search of persons in the police department in New York and the judge dismissed the case.
The second US appeal federal court said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the city's decision of appeal.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city's conclusions and its regulation have come to an end, including the decision to assign supervision to the police department to help change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard arguments for the requested suspension.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge had to be withdrawn from the case because she had been in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, not acting as a judge on demand to avoid the appearance of subordination, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement that she had openly reacted to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officials violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly focused on blacks and Hispanics in the framework of their program of arrest and search for persons.
It established independent supervision to monitor major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test the cameras worn on the body in certain areas where the most frequent stops of persons occur.
In August, the city of New York agreed to the end of the method of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
Oral reasons for the city's appeal are sometimes scheduled after March 14th 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching persons have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form there has been a stopover and search of persons for about a number of decades, but the recorded tours under the care of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, most of the cases were blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom were minorities, wrote a lawsuit that had become the case of a group lawsuit.
The advocates of the changes to the police department's programme of detention and search for persons claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may influence how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that money is wasted, but that there will be no broader problem when the police force is under pressure after thousands of people have reduced its numbers in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she had not completed the practice of stopping and searching the constitutionally speaking persons, but reformed the way the NYPD police search took place.
Five shopping centres face low attendance
This is based on data from the real estate consulting companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Prague Bohnice will open to the public the shopping centre of Krakow, which will be the 19th Prague shopping center.
There are now a total of 90 large trading centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of the medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are an almost large centre against the location and bad layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and opaque arrangement of passages, or dead centers," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of the retail department, Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi faces about five business centres with low attendance.
The main reasons include, among others, poor transport availability, low income categories of local residents or market continuity at a given location.
Some of the projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were initially unsatisfactory.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and reluctant to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centres must try more to 'tangle' their customers on new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The availability of shopping centres is generally stable, even with some centres rising because tenants were willing to discount from rent and rent some units in crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened, which are not fully occupied and the average occupation thus reduce (for example Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
Trade centres opened in the last two years are very slow to market according to Sylvia Samadi.
However, there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of suitable sites for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a project building space that would serve the people of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convience centres', aimed at buying and serving the daily needs of the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
According to Sotak, there is a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Vests like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," added Soták.
In Prague, he sees room for the prepared shopping centre in the winning square, and according to him they also have clear potential of the street in Příkopě and Václav Square.
"Increasingly, the expansion of the retail parks, which allow traders to cover and expand to increasingly smaller cities for favourable rent and operating costs, is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, respecting their reconstruction such as the reconstruction of Prior's commercial houses, which benefit from a good location," Dita Kubánková from DTZ added.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square metres of gross rental areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to information from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, leaving the Czech Republic about 50 square metres per 1,000 population compared to the values from Britain and France.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check his tip.
Andy Coulson allegedly used the methods “to hack into the phone, monitor and confrontation” to confirm the fraudulent tip of the love affair that Charles Clarke, then minister of the interior, was supposed to be involved in.
State representative Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that the News of the World caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his “attractive Special Counselor” Hannah Pawlby.
The news commissioned a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, to hack into Pawlby's voice box and hack into her privacy, but the court heard Coulson called her and left her voicemails.
"The State Representative indicates that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man standing outside the house hoping that people will get out, but a man who likes to tell people stories to see what they say," said Mr Edis.
He said the NotW papers used three ways to explore stories: hacking into phones, monitoring and confrontation.
Editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently, he knows about the other one, the surveillance, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
The rumors of the love relationship that Clarke is involved in were first captured by the NotW News Department, when the source of sexual interest to Mrs. Pawlby was said: "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records in a private investigator's computer where Mrs Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
While Mrs. Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about Paulby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former rapporteur-general Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup were overseeing Mrs Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, telling her: “I got a story we're going to give tomorrow and I'd love to talk to Charles about.
Mr. Edis says the involvement of Coulson in the story was according to the same model as other important personalities, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday, the court heard that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunketta for a love affair with his married wife, while he was seeing Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied contact with other people for telephone hacking from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking the phone.
The unveiling of the NSA increases social paranoia by the state
One peaceful day toward the end of August, the German police helicopter buzzed over the US Consulate Office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German home intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to produce photographs of the roof of the United States front guard, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claims that the BfV office hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this event triggered an exchange of views between the US and German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, the U.S. National Intelligence Director, reiterated that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in favour of US companies and thus enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant from a co-worker, began to discover his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading entrepreneurs, they are no longer aware of their confidence in the Director's words.
According to reports that the US National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company and has gained access to the data available to US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, has achieved general paranoia on State monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came in with the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been on the phone for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be the target, then it is certainly the potential targets of the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden reviewed the intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that as far as industrial espionage and data theft are concerned, the US is now as high a risk as China is.
However, in all the documentation revealed by Mr Snowden, there is no evidence so far that the United States has given the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concerns that the EU lacked certain IT and internet skills and indicated that it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
The leading entrepreneurs are sceptical about it.
The German Parliament called on the voices that we should produce German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany subsidizes from coal to car and farmer.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical feasibility of the American spy agencies discovered by Snowden is shocking for some companies that have so far believed that China is the biggest threat of surveillance.
There is a major shift in cloud computing technology, where European leaders have generally realized that data stored in the US fall under the jurisdiction of the United States and are therefore potentially offensive.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Commercial Community, the security alliance ca 10 per cent of non-American members after the US Prism programme was revealed to the data-processing community has cancelled plans to use a cloud provider based in the US.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “Do we have a new question for customers who weren’t here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction?”
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and that data must be protected at all costs.
Doing economic espionage isn't a surprise.
It's always happened.
"It has been a major topic for many years and it has not changed significantly even during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
Americans are spying on us at business and industrial level, as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
The business leaders generally do not want to boast about the countermeasures that they have made so as not to give the attacker an advantage, where appropriate.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB storage disk at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is inconceivable at least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of Automobile Audi, says that for many years it is common practice to collect mobile phones before the board meeting so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
The German Bureau of BfV advises managers to consider whether to use a simple prepaid mobile phone on foreign voyages due to the risk that smart phones can be compromised.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be fired.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany many of these companies are at the forefront of the global market in their specific areas.
"Little and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised access," BfV warns in its report.
The US is warning its own company against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, National Intelligence Estimate's documents were listed in February France next to Russia and Israel in the second row by perpetrators who are involved in hacking activities for economic rapporteurs, right behind China.
A board member in a German risk-free society concluded that in terms of economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, said in one of the interviews this month: “Services know very well that all countries, while working together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a teenage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
A parent of a teenage boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a busy wrestling spirit in his high school gym believes their son was murdered, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th in a spiritually balanced setting behind the stands in a gym school where he went.
Sheriff's Lawndes County investigators have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy refuses to do so.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," said lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said he did.
"They believe that this contradicts logic, physical laws and also common sense," Crump said.
They feel that this should cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"As usual they sent their son to school and he returned to them in a bag for corpses," he said.
Secretary of State Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
declared Moore at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for routine investigation," he said.
Moore told the press that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of a "dedicated suffocation".
However, according to Moore, the second autopsy indicated another cause of death.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he discovers enough evidence in the case of Johnson's death to investigate a criminal offence or a violation of civil rights, he will request the FBI and its execution.
The deputy sheriff's office from the Lowndes district was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
The judge from Southern Georgia at the centre ordered the authorities to make available all the videos from the surveillance cameras that the investigators saw.
Youth parents hope that the videos will contain a clue that will lead to the discovery of their son’s death.
CDC has issued an allergy directive for schools in children
At the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a set of directives has been published to help in the case of child food allergies at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the U.S. government because the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergy in children rose by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools on how to inform the teaching board and staff about children's food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction, if any, to respond.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline available – the most commonly used EpiPen automatic injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, “It’s like someone is fucking in my tongue, ”“ I feel like I’m wearing hair on my tongue, ” or “My tongue is itchy. ”
Parents of intersexual children may choose “indefinite sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with an inseparable sex structure.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned to either male or female sex.
The new law of parents does not require any sex for such children, and allows them to state sex as “unspecified” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to make a rash decision with their child for sexual purposes and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
An intersexual person according to the BBC, after many years, said: “I am neither a man nor a woman.
I'm going to remain a malt made by a doctor, crippled and scarred.
It is estimated that every year one out of 2,000 children is born, which is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that are included in the diagnosis of sexual development, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
The definition of sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that if it is not possible to define sex, it is better to use the best available information and to identify them rather than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said that the new German law “looks like a good thing. ”
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children do not," he said.
Gender identification can be performed without surgery and then can wait for the identity to develop.
Knowing how sex will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery, why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexuals as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but rather their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These features can be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breast and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual structures, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not respond to any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal allow adults to identify in official documents male, female or “third sex”.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexual" person in June when she won a court appeal so that she could retain the status of an "indefinite" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the German passports will have the exception of M (man) and F (wife) and the third marking, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to the news report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “the theory of gender” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic website online has also been defined against the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is drawn to a new state when sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we turn in turn two other pillars of civilization.”
One mother from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see her children get sexually involved at birth.
“Parenthood itself is stressful even without any other limitations, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said for the website concerning parental care.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called Hermaphrodites, according to the handsome Greek, who had dual sex.
And for about ten years back, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could be erased and redesigned.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, with the fact that sex is a complex matter, and doctors may sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel about their sex when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The continuing theory of how to deal with children of indistinguishable sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that sex was subjective.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that social causes and influences of the environment – as parents raised their child – affected children's genes and hormones and formed a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one 1966 case, known as “John/Joan”, his theory became controversial.
The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged by a miscarriage of circumcision recommended that their child be completely castrated, removed, and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he let himself be reworked into a boy and married a woman.
At 38 years of age, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors have been using this model to date.
But in the 1990s, with the Internet coming, the survivors of these operations appeared to be “unsatisfied with the result”.
It was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes, but not a unique sexual system.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfying life".
And so shortly after he was born in 1976, Bruce had been surgically removed by external organs and testicles and raised as a girl.
At 12 years of age, he had female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
In 18 he was sent to vaginal plastics.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
After my birth, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing sufficient testosterone in order to develop his sexual structure correctly.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took a testosterone dose, and had his breast removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today he represents others in an organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perceptions of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choices (institutions of informed elections) based in California, is concerned that the German law ‘calls for silting and stigmatism’.
"Many activists fear that the German law will bring about encouraging parents to make quick decisions and choose the “indefinite” child," she said.
We're afraid he'll call for an intervention.
We think it's better to assign them to male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will eventually sound, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex".
"The adult should be able to make their own decision on a legally valid gender," she said.
The German law is about to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a little child should not be seduced at this moment.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a disability in sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “gives powers” to both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but the DSD has called insensitive syndrome for androgens.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, they developed a female trait with Katie.
He's got vagina, but he doesn't have uterus and ovaries.
Now she is 29-year-old Katie married and works as an intern at the University of Pennsylvania in child psychiatry.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
"The law will give parents a certain space to avoid rushing through their decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to carry out certain tests and reflect on them and gives them time to write "man" or "wife".
In this respect, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have an amazing kid and you're enjoying it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It makes it possible to involve both the child and the child in decision-making, and it takes away the anxiety that parents are converging because they do not have the certainty that they are doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child will decide with which sex he is more identified – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk spilled the whole house with gas: he threatened to burn it down with his own family!
The tension went up, the fear went down.
The man began to threaten to set the whole house on fire.
All available police patrols in the area, as well as a firefighter unit from Mladá Boleslav and a team of voluntary firefighters, took place.
A police negotiator came to the scene who tried to exonerate the man’s irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
So a strike force must have entered the house to destroy the man and tie him up.
Agresor then ended up investigating a juvenile hospital in Boleslav where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic capture station.
In the end, firemen filled the house with a bandaged gasoline with a sorbent sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition, all the domestic animals were also rescued from the house.
A man didn't put a man in charge of a police negotiator, so the command came to him.
Message: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden as Hillary Clinton
President Obama's closest advisor, according to the New York Times, has secretly considered replacing Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton, vice president of 2012.
This revelation is the most significant sensational eagerly awaited book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times magazine received a copy of the incoming books and announced on Thursday evening that the president's top collaborators were holding intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether the divestment of Biden would help revive Obama's pale hopes for re-election.
According to the National Political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely the former White House head of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the election of former Foreign Minister Clinton to serve as vice president.
The potential change was a top secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few presidents of the closest advisors – including Daley, former Chief of Obama's Jim Messina campaign and former Chief Advisors at the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book Double Down states that Daley was a representative of the effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not significantly increase the chances of Obama.
In his interview with Martin Daley, the administration really considered replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've studied a whole range of things intensively, and this was one of them," he said in favour of Daley's letter.
You must not forget that the president had terrible prospects at that time, so we were like, "Christ, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley described research as “an important care”, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the campaign for re-election had spent a lot of investment to see if this move was worth the vote.
"In campaigns, such money is not spent on elections and qualitative research unless something is seriously considered," Martin said to AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss then knew about this potential card mix.
While Daley said he didn't think the president might have been aware of the potential changes, former head of office admitted that it was "possible" Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book Double down definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on biden's removal from the candidate.
"Possible," said Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British entrepreneur produced the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a glowing pamphlet.
He came up with this idea when he read the expert jellyfish treatise, and he convinced scientists in China to make chemically protein-induced luminosity.
This ice cream reacts with the consumption language – increases the pH in the protein and causes its radiation.
Chris says ice cream shines when it responds to the warmth of your mouth, and the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: "It's an amazing substance, but as far as production is concerned, we're at the beginning, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 g of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your protein mouth warms up, the pH increases and the ice cream starts to shine.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it's causing this fantastic bright effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the luminosity of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every penny costs me about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold tickets.
His next product should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make invisible ice cream."
In essence, it's impossible to break the light of the ice crystal that makes the ice ice, but I'm counting on some way to do it, to find it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish, made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up for a long time and show up to the neighbors in disguise.
I feel like I've become a caretaker today.
For two years, there hasn't been any sugar in my apartment, and this year probably won't be any different.
However, statistics show that as far as Halloween is concerned, I am a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year will celebrate Halloween most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and spend a total of 6.9 billion dollars on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
According to the NRF, out of $6.9 billion spent, it is expected to go 1.2 billion on costumes.
This year is the last shot of fashion sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy food can be like pizza, hamburger and carrot.
As far as men are concerned, I expect we'll see a lot of zombies through the dead parade, and I'll bet that space men from Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, zombie, Batman, pirates and witches are the most wanted costumes.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with walking by tradition.
Last year, we wore our dogs in costumes and we weren't the only ones to my surprise.
In fact, the Americans are spending $330 million this year on pet costumes.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
As for candy, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, sweets Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is an amazing report for 41 million colleagues who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are going to invade our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we're going to buy, and believe me, and we're going to consume 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Sugar Association, almost 16,000 tons will be sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn cans.
It's a secret I've never broken.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than haunting houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terrar behind the walls" (Fresh behind walls, which, by the way, is a real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" (such as, roar) and "The House of Shock" (Holl-O-Scream).
In fact, there are 1,200 haunted homes officially dedicated in the United States that according to the American Scarecrow Houses benefit $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos that you're on and that give your friend on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person that you like will look at the picture and write a comment like "Beautiful Face".
And finally, something about the pumpkins.
As young as we were, Charlie Brown introduced us to a big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and cutting out the pumpkin lantern is something like decorating a Christmas tree – we do it from a baby.
Fortunately for us, the "child in the pumpkin" trend started only last year because of the Pinterest application, so most of us grew up on the fact that we carved the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. U.S. Population Accounting Authority, US Americans spend about $106 million in pumpkins.
A pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.

The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercom equipment.
There are improved brakes, service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and storage of the vehicle between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The contestants who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an attainable path to world-class competitions.
We are pleased that we can offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare contestants for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid races.
Development of the Defender Challenge car we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge in February will offer a training and testing day and also an opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years we have early elections
President-in-Office of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects further early elections in the morning.
A week after the last interview for Aktuálno.cz, he said that there is no other exit and every government comes out from last Friday's vote and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It cannot last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, with his life expectancy of the beginning of the electoral period estimated in two years.
Objectioning that the voters will hardly choose differently next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the president of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next elections as of this year (about 300,000 votes were cast in 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that early elections are to be held, it will strengthen the ANO 2011 movement of Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babish will lose.
The Turbulent Situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka said after the secret meeting of the party's part of the party's leadership that he or Michal Hasek would remain in the leadership of social democracy, he or she commented on Schwarzenberg after:
"The leaders of the democratic party as little boys go to the head of the state to allow them to turn side."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I haven't seen anything so unexpectedly wrong in my life," said President TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (who was confronted in the battle for the presidency) he said, "The role of the head of the state is clear: He wants to take hold of the party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the greatest surprise to you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the House, including the Fargo Register of Contracts, which had been discussed by the House Committees before the elections, but had fallen under the table with early elections.
President TOP 09 in an interview for Aktuálno.cz claims that such speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overcome similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the movement ANO Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in a pre-election fight because of the idea of introducing a contract registry "usually" program of the ANO movement.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of - she simply ignored a proposal that had already been made before the second chamber reading.
Fire units have come to save the lost puppy, which is 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous leap in the quarry.
Ruby's cockroach ran off after a little car accident.
Three days later, a man who was trapped in a kamnolom saw him walking out the dog.
Firemen slid down the rock wall to save the dog from certain deaths.
Puppy was liberated by fire squads who came to free him after being imprisoned in some way on a dangerous discharge in a 14 - foot [15 m] quarry above the ground.
Nine months old, Ruby ran away after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and he survived for three days on his own until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at Flappit Kamenolom in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, they bitterly followed their lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
At about 14.15 p.m. on Wednesday, he saw a bright-eyed sandman trapped Ruby on a swan in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed down to rescue Ruby, using a transport bag for animals to pick him up after the rock.
Andy Clayton, the technical rescue team commander, said, "The dog was in a dangerous situation."
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and below.
He didn't move his eyebrow when he was rescued – he was totally frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then he got some cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
It's unbelievable that someone saw the dog.
A technical rescue team commander, Peter Lau, said: "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a chance that he would be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for inspection, and besides exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was afraid when I looked at the rescue action.
Above all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in his arms again.
The vet said that if he had exhausted himself too much and collapsed, he probably would have fallen.
Firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they've all just been great.
Mr. Alderson of Keigley added: “We were afraid that he might fall, but he remained there. ”
Firefighters were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that after 18 years, Katy Perry definitely didn't leave.
During the interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star this week said that for Jagger's song "Old habitats die hard" from 2004 she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock vet and he went after her.
And she said, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me."
In a statement from Thursday's Jaggerov (70), the deputy said that he categorically refused to ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's messing with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers who showed up on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scotland a choice
The next day, another scary story about independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's wave.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this did not turn into headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they did.
Given that Scotland is not in Schengen now, offering continued dissatisfaction would be a cheap concession for Brussels for anything they really want from Scotland.
So it's a pretty weak story.
In addition, so old that it became a dig, a journalist’s duck, that “independence means passport controls, ” I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, one interesting thought is hidden in this bearded story.
Why should independent Scotland even be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade London ham for the Brusselsn, especially now?
This is a real European story: a great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The impact of the euro crisis is the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Through Europe, the parties to the dedicated resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as common currencies are affected.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came out of nowhere and has already won nearly five million votes in the September Federal Elections, thus essentially "exploiting" Free Democrats (the equivalent of British Liberal Democrats).
On domestic soil, there has always been resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the secession of the Kazakhs on the national economy, has led many people to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are hosting a high budget deficit – that was true only in Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members on exchange rates favourable to German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currencies, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenue and public expenditure – which Germany calls for.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is the deeper cause of European malpractice performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – the code to support French and German companies for consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as it is in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the area of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the frozen wages in the world would not reverse the stifling of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the United States.
The result is a repressive rebellion, especially in France, once an enthusiastic EU leader.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that will keep Germany in line and enable Paris to rise to the level of Washington in the world.
Berlin, however, is no longer in need of political legitimacy as a certificate of political legitimacy and has left its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy destitute.
Result: The right wing of Marine Le Penová, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and pushed the ruling Socialists into third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% votes – an early warning to British Labourers that they cannot conclude that the crackling of justice is automatically positive on the left hand.
How does Le Penová treat her newly acquired popularity among the Belarusian working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European anti-counsel block across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a block may dominate the history of the European Parliament for the first time.
At the same time, I think that, in the near future, the growing anti-European feeling and the attitude against the common currency will unite and the euro will be lost.
The EU will not disappear, but it will change to something more free in the sense of the 'Europeans (superior) nations', already favoured the General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will renew their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, the increased interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where's Scotland going to be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the opportunity to announce Berlin and Brussels when we are to be left behind.
I assume that Scotland would do well in the relaxed organisation of Europe, provided it keeps its own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The government of SNP in Scotland is the most successful political movement in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition to the scruples planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the next coalition of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now opted for independence just to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Temporary puberty: Adults earlier
Research has shown that African Americans and Hispanic women reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes don't mean puberty's coming.
It is not proven that hormones or other chemicals are behind this.
Experts say that one of the triggeres of earlier puberty may be obesity epidemics.
The trend of earlier puberty isn't so obvious in boys.
Former rapporteur CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should the mother be terrified when her daughter starts growing breasts and hairdressing at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children’s Physicians this week in Orlando, a pediatric endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I have spent a lot of time making sure that my parents make sure that this is not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hairdressing and armpits and body smell, appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there has been only a small shift at the age of the first period of menstruation.
In the United States, it is now an average age of 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 in 1970.
“When the breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years will pass before the first menstruation occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem” (Time puberty in girls: An essential manual for dealing with this common problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
Discussing what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spruce before 8 years of age, the girl is considered to be “prematureally mature”.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which children’s doctors can closely monitor.
Faster growth can be a reason for the endocrinologist to carry out tests to eliminate serious problems such as cancer or cyst.
There are therapeutic procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging, which may eventually lead to growth and maturity in adulthood.
The recommendations for medicines and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that “the remission of puberty can alleviate the girl’s problems and her feelings of being different from her peers”.
Another major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They worry that they may become pregnant or how they will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," said one woman whose daughter began to have menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not ready emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no related set of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Capulitz suggests that obesity is the most serious cause.
In 2001, he helped with the study of girls aged 6 to 9, which combines body fat with puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country African Americans and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty before their whites.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by all possible economic conditions through the climate to the genes.
Another puzzle: Although at a low age, boys experience facial and defensive hairs, the trend towards full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as girls do.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Association of Children’s Physicians (AAP) added additional complexity to this topic.
Acne and hairy defenses are common even in infants and backpacks.
"We must be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean the need to talk to a child before you know it," Caplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who develop earlier need to be assured that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Nada Konvalinková in the role of hospice.
Does he have a new job?
Herreka Nadya Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bench in the role of economics and she was very good at it.
That a favorite Czech actress planned to change her profession and go to business in the pub?
Nada Konvalinková appeared at James Joyce Irish pub and made beer there.
I've done it for the first time in my life, and I could do it right away.
My boss even offered me a job, and I could live with beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay with what I'm doing today in acting," said Konvalinková, who was a guest at the twentieth anniversary of the Irish pub's functioning.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey there," she said.
Nadi’s longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and in my new life, I can't gloat.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I'm trying to keep it," the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers with seat width, at stake there are large orders
A second-class dispute over the width of seats in long-distance flights between the leading aircraft manufacturers fueled the cause of a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai this month.
The subject of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-range flights for the economic class – not exactly the one which airlines would normally have preceded, but whose space allocated is the key to performance claims for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus called for industrial standards this week that would offer at least 46 cm of wide seats in the economic class, but the main American Boeing rival says it is up to airlines to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers competed in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine remote aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is decomposed – especially whether it is adjacent to 9 or 10 seats – is the basis for economic performance claims on the proposals of the new aircraft ‘mini-jumbo’.
Boeing says the improved model “777X” transports 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm decomposed by 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competitive version of its model A350 transports 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats decomposed after 9.
The giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through commercials in the professional media.
Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to gain advantage with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what could be the beginning of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture showing three people printed in a restaurant entitled “Would You Like It?”
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in the seat of more useful than they are in the regional turbot aircraft," said Airbus John Leahy, a leading salesman.
As dietary patterns change, people are larger, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, the average American weight between 40 and 49 years of age has increased by 10 percent, according to data from the U.S. Ministry of Health.
According to American health statistics, the average American has a 100 cm waist in the 21st century.
Airbus claims that his rival adhered to the concept of seats from the 1950s, where the average width of seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus argues that it has carried out research suggesting that the extension of the seat will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing's size of Airbus' seats refuses and says it is not within the competence of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines balance their fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
“In fact, it is about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do things they believe must be done to be successful,” said the cabin specialist Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what brings them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers it is a major larger area for elbows, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute is a race in aircraft orders with estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to elevate the English scale of American and European exports.
As Reuters stated in July, the distribution of seats is precisely what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing argue that they reach 20 percent more effective than the market leader in this segment for their last two-engine long-range aircraft designs, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The Boeing performance requirements depend in part on comparing the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is reduced compared to the 10-bed concept.
"The reason why Boeing does this is to push up more seats and make his planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, a guide for comfort travellers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing models 777 are in line with the fact that many passengers are for a denser distribution that can go hand in hand with lower charges.
"The 40-inch wide seat for passengers would be great, but the reality is that from a business point of view Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777," said an expert on the interior of Mary Kirby's cabin, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver seats, but offer air companies a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Passenger aircraft salesmen even carry a measuring band with them to check competitive arrangements.
While it is comfortable, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a high-density arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers a model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Airbus had previously stressed the need for a larger cabin adjustment by offering wider seats in the alleys for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but may discourage the wave of sales of 777X.
The number of HIV infected exceeded the 1,000th century in Prague
The number of infected annually increases in the Czech Republic.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121, and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 people were infected, and it was a record number.
"There is no doubt in my mind that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light to patients for years.
According to him, 165 HIV patients arrived in the country from January to September last year, 176 during the same period.
From the start of monitoring until the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
There were 206 people infected in the Central Bohemian region.
Even 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian Silesian or 116 from the Ústecké region, were interviewed.
The least infected were from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, this case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV and transferred from their mother.
I mean, there's a lot of nonsense in Gravity's movie, but it's beautiful, hard-core experts.
The fantastic movie from the Universe of Gravity sold a cinema sometime after the premiere in the Czech Republic.
In October, nearly 150,000 viewers were seen by the Union’s film distributors and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
There are, however, some inconsistencies in it.
Lidovka Server.cz asked experts from a series of astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Stargate Editor and Planetary Brno): I like science-fiction films that I consider to be modern, dream stories.
The film Gravity does not stand out, although it looks like a "physically real" performance.
No, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice, for example, Sandra Bullock's hair, which is somehow not hanging in a state of troublelessness.
Hubb's spacecraft and the International Space Station are moving along very different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some movie audiences blame the unreal effect and even the whole behavior of the fire in a state of troublelessness.
They wouldn't think they'd have sustained that kind of wound.
Heroes in Gravitation often get into conflict with different objects and suits without any major difficulties.
Criticism has not been spared, nor has there been any major complication.
Such an extensive tragedy on Earth's orbit is, according to some who are discussing it, unrealistic.
And he wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People in the forums also argue about the "unreal" behavior of ropes.
She said it works like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Headmaster of the Starry and the Planetarium of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide canvas, but clearly I can say, I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but a science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (neighbourly duty) not to stick consistently to reality.
"More than you mentioned the irregularities, I was touched by the three-time display of space stations with destructive levels of technology (last time Chinese)."
"The Chinese, after all, will look better than they are in the film."
Vladimír Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences): In computer-generated scenes, authors are very successful in not violating physical laws, and so naturally oriented viewers estimate that during various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of momentum, said by the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from outer space, is very realistic including the thin shell of the atmosphere and the polar glow forming in the polar regions.
Incomparability will certainly be found during a more detailed examination.
In addition, I found, for example, when reading comments, that the preferred direction for the circulation of various space debris on the orbital path appears to be reversed in some scenes before it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (Employer of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators to their needs, but no fundamental and heaven-based errors calling against logic or natural laws have been recorded in the film, and compared to other films of the same kind, it is evident that the creators have taken care of the credibility of the events shown.
From moments that do not make sense, it is worth naming the fact that Hubble's space telescope orbits in a otherwise inclined orbit than ISS.
As a result, there is a significant difference between the speed and the rescue operation, so it could not actually take place as shown in the film.
Further, at the time of the Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I have not noticed that the entire ISS would rotate, so there is not even a clear origin of the power that operates on Kowalski, which forces both actors to move when they are no longer moving towards each other.
A new nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure from smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse against nicotine addiction for the rest of its life.
Before testing people, it is necessary to carry out further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We strongly hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhaust all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches are overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information for the formation of anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to form a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies pursue all the nicotinic molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, thus preventing the smoker from getting nicotinic interference.
In the tests of the vaccineed mouse, which was added to nicotine additionally, they continued their routine activities.
But the mice, who were not vaccinated, “smoothed, ” said researchers, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in Science Translation Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given so often that adequate levels of antibodies remained so that they proved expensive and non-practical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into factories for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for humans are completely safe, they could give themselves to children before they have the taste of a cigarette and avoid addiction to nicotine.
However, it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, there will be no benefit in nicotine vaccine, and that will help them to get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for Monitoring Corruption.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, denied that he would change the policy of coastal leases at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in the three properties of the government of controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) extended its inquiry to see whether Mr Obeid was lobbying for several state ministers to rent him a circular Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and a coffee shop, without having to take part in the tender procedure after his dismissal in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obei's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by the former representative of Mr. Tripodi's office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted more long-term terms.
In 2009, rents for enterprises in Circular Quay, which brought $2.5 million annually to Obeid, were renewed without the need to take part in the competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a promoter of public competitions.
However, he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obed, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, insisted on the move in government rent policy.
The transcript of the calls submitted by the ICAC showed the calls from August to September 2007 between the masters Obeid and Steve Dunn, a leading official who came to the port vault after working under Mr Obeide in the fishing department.
"Was he the subject of interviews during these phone calls the development of commercial lease policies?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but it's definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeide.
Israeli military aircraft attacked a target in Syria, said the responsible official
Israeli military aircraft hit the target Thursday night at the Syrian port of Lazikija, confirmed the responsible administration of Fox News.
This responsible factor specifically did not say what the target was, but said it was at least one.
The press agency Associated Press states that the targets were SA-125 Russian production.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out an air raid on the delivery of rockets in Syria.
A lot has moved, and it's different.
For example, Pečina, commentator, said that it was acceptable to say that while President Štěch was exhaling disquieting.
Heitman Chovanec was my suspect as soon as he was elected to the Presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of this misery ČSSD continues.
The other gentlemen have shown their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is a fundamental and legible and useless, Vice President Zaorálek has been weakened by the most conversation on TV.
On this basis, I see no better option than for the ČSSD to propose to the Vice-President of the Senate of Gajdůško, the only one not to have an initial hendicap and I think it would perform standard performance.
It's such a good solution that hardly any of the leaders will support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdůšková could, without fear, build a minority government with just a blessing from President Babiš and without the people, but with the Humanities Minister of Health, Hovorka, who is actually a religious social democrat.
This minority government would have great stability because it would enforce the proper law on referendum and this was the commitment of the President of Ocamura.
Chairman Babish would eventually accept the progress of the tax, for he is sharp and will see that it is not possible without it.
Humans would not bring problems because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not be in government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, and a valuable minister would be found here, but if they wisely do not want to enter into a risky government participation, but will provide support, also well.
Let's give Alena the Gajdůšek the courage!
Foreign visa holders may undergo the “licence” test
With the government's intention of extending police procedures, it considers the "authority test" for foreign visa workers 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied by means of criteria in order to prevent 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a rear door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government rhetoric on foreign workers with words that this could offend the Australian neighbours.
“A loud statement by “foreigners” and “work first for Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant from the time the unions demanded a protected labour market," the Australian-Indian Institute said today.
Historically, it meant protecting the Belarusian labor force – and I would not wonder if anyone in this region had noticed the echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, dealing with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes and others remained to be considered.
Where the criteria for ‘authority’ are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal relationship with the owner or the person concerned of the sponsor’.
After previous experience with enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of workers, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka, who sought asylum, died suspected of a heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship this week on Christmas Island.
The man’s nine - year - old frightened son traveled to Australia with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the ship.
The Australian authorities and a man were rushing to a hospital on Christmas Island where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase starts in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "will unite Britain together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was working with the British government on this plan "stuffed".
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the completion of the Phase two will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reevaluated the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted interviews with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to explore additional railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of occasional travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London equivalent to three hours and less.
Baronka Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is indeed a national network that will better connect Britain and its cities.”
We put SH2 green because the benefits it brings are huge.
Without it, we face a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also a connection – across the UK, thanks to HS2, 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
Mr Carmichael called for the Scottish government to "singlely" support the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “High-speed track has the potential to bring great economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland in the overall case of high-speed railways across Britain.”
So we are excited to work with the British government to explore the possibilities of bringing a high-speed railway to Scotland and thus bringing all the benefits and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is planning.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British ministers during the next year and to making joint decisions on other steps.
Both the inspection and the anti-corruption police analyst have been arrested with Barta.
Information about the arrest of Vita Barta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the report was brought by server Firstzpravda.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the case was taken over by the General Security Guard Inspection (GIBS), her people were to arrest Bart in the centre of Prague.
It was in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where there are accused police officers, but civil persons are also subject to its jurisdiction.
According to the MF DNES, Jan Petržílek is among the arrestees and one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - lead analyst and informatics.
He used to work for the Security Information Service.
Speaking anti-corruption police Jaroslav Ibehej, however, refused to comment with the wolf that the media had to turn on GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokesman's inspection, Radka Sandor, however, did not want to say anything about the case, returned to the Municipal State Attorney's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question in the light of the protection of classified facts," said the spokesman Štěpánka Zenklová.
It can also be deduced from this non-specific reaction that the event took place, but it is in a covert mode that prevents the speaker from saying anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's attorney, Oldrich Chudob, is also a lawyer.
The media said that Bartu represents "and in this matter," but since it's classified information, Bart's arrest cannot be confirmed or reversed.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
Barta, together with former VV President Radek John, who was headed by the Ministry of the Interior, was asked to do so.
The dispute that has fueled up between the prime minister Peter Nečas and the VV even had to be dealt with by then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship got on my person.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," said IDNES.cz Lesy.
In January 2011, Lesy became chief of police.
Although he was officially promoted by Radek John, the real leader of the party, he was Bart at the time.
Barta was now running for election for the Usvet movement, and the MP's mandate escaped only in closeness - by 175 votes.
The leader of the dawn, Tomio Okamura, has declared that he has no idea what this is all about.
"Viet Bart was one of many candidates for many parties on our candidate and, as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the dawn of direct democracy Tomia Okamura," distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given Bart space to run for the dawn because he helped him solve the problem of the executioners.
Vít Barta was in court in 2012 with his former co-partner with the VV Jaroslav Škárko.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in an aircraft shall remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Passengers from Australian airlines will still have to turn off their tablets and smart phones during the start-up and landing, even though changes in the US are being made in order to reduce regulation on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given American companies space to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical flight phases if the equipment remains in the ‘aircraft’ mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the start-up and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they are not planning to change their procedures soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it had examined this notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
‘CASA currently does not have any specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on board the aircraft,’ he said.
This question is covered by the provisions requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they obtain from crew members.
Virgin, who had already talked to CASA about extending the use of her on-board entertainment system wi-fi, was inclined to change but announced that a decision of the regulatory authority would be submitted.
"We would welcome an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that this would improve customers' experiences now that we have (wireless onboard entertainment),” the speaker said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon," he said.
FAA rules apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful to our passengers, and we certainly are thoroughly examining the FAA decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will differ from the company and will depend on the age of their air fleet.
Transporters will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training materials, manual luggage programs and information for passengers.
“If the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones at any altitude,” said the FAA.
In rare cases, the low visibility of the crew shall order the passengers to shut down during the landing of the device.
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in the storage area above the head during take-off and descent.
With growing poverty, middle classes experience pawnshops in Singapore bloom
Janani Amirthalinga’s gold bracelet, ring and earrings are stopped at the Bendemeer shopping price in Singapore so that she can pay for her daughter’s tuition.
"We just bought a house with our husband and I put all my money on it," says Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although every month as an administrator receives $2,400 (300 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, he says.
Demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – is indeed such that ValueMax, where a woman conducts her transaction, has this week become a third pawn shop on a ladder in Singapore.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to lend cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Shippers in Singapore normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require verification of the person (payment history) or of the income document and can provide the loan more quickly than the banks.
Therefore, with families feeling pressure because of rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to cope with worsening financial situations.
This week, Standard & Poor's credit rating agency quoted the increasing use of home credit primarily because of the rising rents as a risk factor for creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have regard to the gross domestic product of the highest household debt in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the 80 percent of GDP ladder, which is an increase compared to 60 percent in 2008.
The economists also feared a high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which just came out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and deterioration of consumer demand.
"The important thing is that with the rising costs people from medium to low [receptive scales] will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malian bank CIMB.
Historic high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are busy stopping their personal possessions and taking advantage of the opportunity to change their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city buildings are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get him back next month.
The largest builder operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its pawn shop in recent months.
Growth in the founding sector is so large that ValueMax, a branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where there are four branches – but also outside Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance it by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD that it won this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discounted creditors were under fire under criticism for high interest, Mrs. Yo says that the flag offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Consignors stop items that they already own and the moneying of personal property does not increase household debt," he says.
In the company, the stockholding is increasingly taken as a means to ensure short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, those who use pawnshops are not just people in financial distress.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax branch when stopping gold bars or Rolex watch, and they can get up to 60 percent of the cash price.
Our customers are of all sorts.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow for short periods because of their daring trades or investments, or small businesses who need help solving problems in their cash flow," said Mrs. Yeahová.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as they can.
Savings package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for a dying health care in Tasmania contains tough conditions to ensure that the government does not waste funds.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Pliberseková, announced that the Australian Union is making “accelerated measures” to reverse the crisis caused by an ageing island population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The four-year funding was decided following government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems that the state faces," Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the patient's request.
Further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and grey cell operations, will help to remove debt.
Money is also available at open-source clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the identification of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the ideas that leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system," Mrs. Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Government of Tasmania must require a strict reporting regime and registration obligations.
The state will have to maintain its current level of funding in order to receive the money from the Australian Union and to report monthly on where additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be useless, "until there is a genuine reform to lay the more sustainable foundation of the Tasmanian public health system".
Nevertheless, he commended the government for responding to his request for accelerated assistance, which he had first brought in the negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe that a federal aid package can exonerate public health from a critical state," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Peter Dutton, speaking federal health opposition, believes that today's statement is only a "plague".
"The reason why I'm here is that the Labour Government has taken $430 million out of our health system," said ABC TV.
You can't have a government that takes away nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian Union that is dedicated to $300 million, and pretends to be good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from the rescue package would be issued for higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niklaux adapted the novel Denise Diderot, which brings an exceptional film tour and creation of time, but it is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in the 1960 ’ s in France and tells a grim story about Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to the monastery by his family.
When he rebels, he experiences extreme cruel treatment from the seriously perverted mother who is introduced and becomes an object of sexual passion for others.
The film will never slip into greed or sensuality, and that's his problem.
The ritual picture of this story leads to the audience to experience torture similar to wearing a leather shirt.
Skiarels want to make their families happy with their children
Syria has destroyed its means of producing chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, the global arms control committee said on Thursday, while sharp conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the sites where toxic substances were suspected to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also declared that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The notification to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
the term which this organization established in The Hague for the purpose of destroying or preventing the operation of all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and machinery for mixing chemicals for the purpose of creating toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy by mid-2014 all chemical weapons of Damascus.
Destroying equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to manufacture new chemical weapons.
But the Damascus must still begin to destroy existing weapons and stockpiles.
It is assumed that this country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons including sorite and nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday, fighting in the city of Safira, which experts speak of as the headquarters of the chemical weapons factory and storage facilities, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, established in Britain.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of which 61,067 are to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar Assad, 18,678 government fighters and 187 armed men from Lebanese Hezbollah.
There should also be 2,202 government fugitives killed and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, 2011, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict forced some 2 million inhabitants to leave the country.
Assad's troops have fought in Safira against the insurgents, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaida for weeks.
The observatory stated on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The fights have highlighted the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors, who, on their mission, when in the midst of the ongoing civil war, Syria is to dispose of the chemical arsenal, must deal with tight deadlines.
In a statement from the OPCW, which is closely cooperating with the UN, it was said that his team is now “satisfied that he has verified – and observed destruction – the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/fulfill”.
He added that “there are currently no other control activities planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
The Inspectors said they were unable to visit two places because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two sites were “left and ... items of the chemical weapons programme containing them have been moved to two other declared sites which have been checked” according to Syria.
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed on a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I pledge the courage and courage you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organization has ever had," said observer director Ahmet Uzumcu in his comment issued by OPCW.
Now, in its third year, it stands against itself in the civil war, especially the Sunni Muslim rebels and Asad's government, with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alavithian sect, the foothold of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, Chief Observer Ramí Abdul Rahmán said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday inside the anti-aircraft facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lázikja.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over a judgment handed down against the founder of a bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a bomb attack on Bali in 2002 responded in an insidious manner to a verdict handed down over the last of the founders who had been built before justice, and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for building an explosive device that was used in a bomb attack.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder during an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist region of Kut, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other counts of charges related to terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution claimed life, although it could insist that a man with the nickname “Demolition Man” (Burderer) should be punished by his reputation as an expert in the production of explosives.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders almost ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should be in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP Agency, Mrs Corteen said: "It should be built in front of a firing squad."
Every day, I have to live with the fact that I don't see any more grandchildren and daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when a strong charge placed outside the parked van was launched shortly after the 23rd hour of October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell a month into a coma, and while he was kept alive, three times the doctors “dead. ”
Mr Hughes said that Pateka should face the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jamá Islamija responsible for the massacre – Amroshi, Muchlas and Imam Samudru – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get a death sentence like no one.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it just isn't.
Get 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, it's not that much.
Patek was court-martialed as the last of the Bali assassins.
The arrest was avoided for almost ten years, but in January 2011 he was eventually captured in Pakistan's town of Abbottabad, where less than four months later American forces killed former leader Al-Qaeda Osama bin Ladina.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that reports from intelligence services revealed that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet Bin Ladin in an attempt to reconnect between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He has not given up voluntarily," Mrs Corteen said.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for how much grief he caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary attack, which will be later this year and will include ceremony on Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of tears," Mrs Corteen said.
The duck can appeal against the verdict.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological gains on aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – except for calls from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of eagerly expected new rules, which the Federal Air Administration (FAA) issued Thursday.
Travelers, however, should not expect change to occur immediately.
As soon as the change is implemented, according to the different airlines, FAA administrator Michael Huert said at a press conference.
The FAA management will have to prove how many of their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the storage directive in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"We can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly depending on the state of the plan," the FAA stated in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors close.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives his permission.
Passengers are expected to shut down their devices again when the plane drops to land and they do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and take-off operations, the FAA has indicated.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at a higher altitude are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards Association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new rules are safely implemented – and we will cooperate closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
He's sincerely tired of us looking like "guards".
However, surfing, e-mailing and texting or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometres above sea level, the Agency said.
Passengers will be advised to switch their smart phones, tablets and other devices to the aviation regime.
So still no Words with friends, online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, kicked out of American Airlines' plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like notebooks will still have to be stored for fear that they could hurt someone if they flew around the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones do not specify the FAA, but the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may cancel the ban on certain electronic equipment during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Committee, a national safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are indeed a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but from FCC data we also know that in the air they can cause interference with broadcasting towers," Rosenker said.
In order to examine the problem, the FAA’s Branch Advisory Committee proposed last month that the government allow wider use of electronic equipment.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is widespread.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the technical equipment of the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but they are also constructed and approved by FAA management to be resistant to electronic interference.
Air companies have been offering Wi-Fi travellers at sea altitudes for several years.
Plans designed for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
A large majority of airlines should adapt to the new rules for greater use of electronic equipment, Huertová said.
The current electronic equipment generally emit much less intense radio transmission than it was with the devices of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers publish only minimal transmissions when turning the page.
But broadcasting is stronger when the devices download or send data.
Among those who press for the release of restrictions on the use of these facilities by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the plane with their Kindle electronic readers and carried out the test flight, but no problem was revealed.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Passengers Association of Air Company said he believed that the disruption from these facilities was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee stated that there were only partial reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices could cause disruption of air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut down during flight by low visibility devices.
The group of tourism industry welcomed these changes and considered it to be a reasonable procedure for the public passengers, who use technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognised that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Tourism Association.
The bird was flown from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on a oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One of the cruisers was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA in a rescue centre until he was cured.
Colin Seddon's business centre said: "This christal probably migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind swept it over the North Sea."
Apparently, he's out of strength and found shelter on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us with a request for help. ”
At the time of his baptism, he was in good condition and health.
Is the European elite ready for business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to link businesses and define what changes in relations with the EU would like to be seen by British entrepreneurs and job-generating companies.
To this end, we set out the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 business leaders representing UK businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see how the government favours new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than turning into a long and strenuous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas – from monopolies to product laws – the majority of entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the Single Market and businessmen said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trade area – even 40 per cent of large enterprises, the traditional most pro-European companies.
And in the end, our research by business leaders has revealed the most eloquent knowledge, although a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the contract and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings identified by enterprises of different sizes and major business groups suggest that the business sector is pushing for a “sensual change” that will translate back into Britain.
There is a great deal at stake – reaching a change of contract and a better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% in the vote in the EU's referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to change the terms of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this change to mean a significant shift from the current balance of forces back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and as the euro area travels beyond economic and fiscal union, it is increasingly necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as shown by the results of our survey, for business, this means a renewed focus on trade and a major change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry confessed: spying went too far!
The United States went to spy sometimes "too far", admitted US diplomat John Kerry's head, according to AFP, during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the Minister, he was responsible for the deterrence of terrorist attacks.
The "First Washington confession" according to the AFP sounded in the middle of a sharp controversy on both sides of the Atlantic due to a scandalous revelation about the mass data monitoring by the US National Security Agency (NSA), the target of which was also US allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as the President (Barack Obama) has done, some of these events have gone too far and we make sure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he was primarily a advocate of practice.
The gathering of information is deemed necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations, such as attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA, assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
"We prevented airplanes from falling, buildings exploded, and people were killed because we were able to be informed of the plots in time," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone disproportionately far".
An affair around American intelligence that has reportedly been watching hundreds of phone calls has broken out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also watching the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
European leaders did not hide resentment, and some called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prevent or significantly limit monitoring.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is starting a new gas age
The launch of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launching of one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"Today we are witnesses to the milestone: a construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the biggest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the whole European continent.
South Stream pipelines should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
The contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risks of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are always removed.
As soon as the project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream pipeline at a cheap price.
Gazprom says that construction is to begin at the end of this year in other countries.
Gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2,2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits.
Lebanon's Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle over the Kalamún region.
According to the ongoing reports from Israel in the mid-term raids on two locations in Western Syria, it was Hezbollah who destroyed missiles.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its program is also a fight against Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said it would prevent the transfer of arms to the hands of Hezbollah to Lebanon.
Reports of the Israeli mid-term raids on weapons storage facilities in Western Syria are just being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Damress.com hit missiles fired from the Mediterranean area by the Syrian rocket base Snúbar Djabla south of Latakíje.
Al-Arabija news stations claim that two warehouses have been hit, where missiles have been prepared for transport to Lebanon.
According to its sources, it was Russian production rockets SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Jishai said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizbollah rockets and Syrian air force teaches members of the armed section Hizbollah to handle missiles.
SA-8 are obsolete missiles that have been in the Syrian army since the 1980s.
They're located on a moving chassis.
Although relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, it is easy to hide them.
They're equipped with a radar that will turn off after the fire, so it's hard to focus them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling alaves.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
They say it helps protect the Syrian Shiite community with which the avalanches belong.
Now, apparently 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help the army recover the Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
According to the source al-Arabija, the battle is to be retaliated for the recent attack by the opposition to the Syrian Shiite Brigade Command and Fadal Abbás in the Shia part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to fight back this year the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border.
Many insurgents from Kusajra have just gone to Kalamun.
Recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wished for early elections.
Corruption, money laundering for excessive purchases and government contracts, tax increases and last but not least government scandals were cited as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, the majority of the citizens have complied with this situation.
That they didn't really mind the condition that was here (the theft and debt of this state) they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I can't explain that 3 413,497 voters didn't make the election, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted for ODS in total, i.e. 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all legal voters.
Which is half the majority.
When 1 016 829 ČSSD voters were reported to the above parties, then with the old order (because all the parties mentioned participated in the "deployment" and indebtedness of the state), 64.23% of the eligible voters actually agreed to this state.
In fact, the majority of voters have made it clear that they are not for the punishment of the perpetrators of the theft and preponderance of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who were involved in this were involved in the principle of the relevant laws?
Is it even possible to help us?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) were charged with lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with sexual abuse of children before the charges against Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011.
But before the Commission, it was said that in its initial statement to the Commission, this association stated that they had never dealt with a case of sexual abuse of a child in their organization.
The executive director, Phillip Hare, was questioned when one of the employees of the YMCA association was charged with child pornography offences and another where the gymnasium in Caringbah from the YMCA association was convicted in 1991 for sexual harassment of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counselor to the commission, he knew about the first case, but not about the second one.
He admitted that the YMCA initial statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in YMCA, which assessed this organization as a leading advocate of children's rights.
The evidence presented by the Commission indicates that the YMCA has been informed that it received the second lowest of the four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and the company in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that his leadership from himself had failed to accept Mr. Lord without ensuring that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was sentenced to sexual harassment by 12 boys who were committed during the two years he worked in the YMCA association.
He's been imprisoned for at least six years.
However, Mr. Hare rejected the claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting a violation of the safety of children by Mr. Lord.
The staff members provided evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, privately guarded them, let them sit on his lap, told them that he liked them, and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under Lord's command and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacques Barnath, the head of the YMCA Children's Service in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was “very intimidating and often difficult to talk to.”
The Director-General said that he did not accept the staff's evidence that they did not feel comfortable if they were to contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had clouded their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that the YMCA Association Council in New South Wales had expressed his opinion that the lesson from the "case of Jonathan Lord" for the organization was that the staff "did not submit any report" and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign the silence agreements shortly after the charges appeared was made by the General Manager for Child Services at YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said that the aim was to avoid tampering with evidence, but it was “extremely zealous” and poorly implemented.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the committee that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that was safe for children in 2009 to 2011.
He said that there were serious problems in recruitment, checking, processing, training and personnel management.
The hearing was postponed until December 20th.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance of returning to the post of prime minister, but admitted that a return is unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when Mr Blair resigned in his leading position for ten years, he has mostly avoided talks about British politics and has limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador of the Bízko East Peace Quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his response to the London newspaper Evening Standard was as follows: “Yes, of course, but it may be difficult to realize that, so...”
While the Cardiff group of experts gathered to show horses to fight for the horse price of the year, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although they don't go to school yet and only a few months ago did the first steps, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, gently pierced three wheels to win the prize and left 30 pulling adults behind.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was praised for its appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition run by Sunnybank riding centre in Rudry village near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, put his baret in a happy angle and let his two-year-old Toffee ride around the circle.
Fenton was praised for his natural ability to control horses far beyond his age.
And Toffee gained the highest marks for appearance and personality.
Fenton Toffee got his third birthday in March and has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee work perfectly together. ”
They didn't make much hope, but eventually they left with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale in South Wales walks in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was cheering and clapping. ”
He ran for sand all over the arena, and even though he did so fine, he did a great job.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm and he gets two chickens in charge.
Given how he started, he'll be at the Horse of the Year again soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
The speaker of the annual horse show competition said: "The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control the ponies."
They make a great team together.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they showed up in the competition.
They always watch how good teamwork is between the pony and the one who leads it – and Fenton and Toffee were the best at the oval.
I'm sure it helped Fenton's cute clothes, too, really got in there with him.
Too many investigative papers are to be investigated.
The Chinese newspaper, who requested the release of a reportant accused of a complaint on the front page, will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
News New Express made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou in Guangzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on TV that he was taking bribes to come up with stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said the New Express newspapers would now carry out a "full repair".
The regulation came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that from September 2012 to August 2013, New Express from the Youngcheng Group Evening News published several false reports about the listed company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was unordered," the administrator said in his statement.
He said he had to decide to "put Chen Yongzhou's administrative punishment in the form of a cancellation of a journalist's license".
He also “ordered the Yangtchen Group Evening News to correct the letter New Express as a whole, and recommended that the responsible persons in New Express be examined and immediately changed the management of the New Express letter. ”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express concerning financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his papers issued two requests for his release on the front page and claimed to be worthy of his press work.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on state television and confessed to giving false stories for payment.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," said CCTV at the state intelligence station.
I did it mainly because I was looking for money and fame.
I realize I've been doing the wrong thing.
Following Mr Chen's apology, he issued a letter to the cover of an apology stating that he had failed to carry out sufficient control of his reports.
Recently, several highly monitored suspects were granted on television.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of the amendment of this year's law, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A drug smuggling tunnel was found between the US and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most intelligent drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been discovered, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The U.S. authorities have described the tunnel of dimensions about 1 meter to 1 meter as one of the smartest secret corridors they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which reaches the length of almost six football courses, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the USA.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before being loaded with drugs.
The authorities indicated that the tunnel had been closed before drugs could have been transported undetected in it.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three of the officials who worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the event of a conviction, the sentence shall be suspended from 10 years to life.
In the town of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate large drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered in October after a cradle of marijuana in central Mexico, which puts the drug cartels at risk, as soon as possible, to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a hall of about 650 metres in length equipped with railways, which led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economia and the Center connect the management.
They will offer, for example, a common advert
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken another step to transform the holding centre into its media house.
Since Friday, Economy and the Centre have shared top management.
"The unified organisational structure and the staff union are essential for the integration of both publishers into the joint media house," comments the changes made by the Vice-President of the Presidency of Economies and the entrusted Director-General Kamil Čermák.
Čermák, who will lead the single management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demith.
The new Joint Director of Trade was appointed Pavel Voparil, who is subject to both Zuzana Tilcherová and the Austrian director.
Štěpán Burd became the new head of information technology.
Vladimír Piskáček is a joint editor and director of the transformation of Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts was entrusted with the newly established function of marketing director.
The separate department of corporate communication is now in charge of the Lhotská Vera.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publications is led by Petr Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the content of all published titles and, last but not least, to further improve the company's business management," Čermák added.
Economia, owned by Finance Minister Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a purchase agreement with Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
Portfolio Centre Holdings consists of servers Aktuálno.cz, Geneva.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB Agency Definitely or portfolio of other almost two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is a publisher of the Economic Newspapers, the IHNED.cz news server, weekly Respekt and Econom and the number of B2B titles printed on the Internet.
Among the Czech publishers is the long-term most successful in selling digital versions of their main titles.
In June this year, publishing moved to newly built modern space in Prague's Karlína.
CME is targeting TV business.
He'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will release.
By the end of the year, he wants to harvest by a thousand people.
He's going to cut all the side-activities and he just wants to focus on his major business, his TV show.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of 4,500 people.
Almost a dozen people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is a company that holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of MTV music stations.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the TV Nova TV station in the country is not clear yet.
"This is premature and we can't really comment on it," said communication director Nova Josef Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES, significant releases to the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but far the greatest impact this should have on the personnel situation of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both the new chiefs of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who followed Adrian Sarbu's long-standing director, spoke during the Wednesday conference call with analysts about the fact that they want to limit all activities that are not directly related to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing own shows, film and production activities.
In Prague's industrial area, the coolant tower burned down at night
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, a large storage tank was burned, according to firefighters apparently a cooling tower.
"On Thursday, 11 a.m., fire was being extinguished by fire," said the spokesman for Prague firefighters Pavel Adamcová.
The amount of air pollutants in the area by measurement did not exceed the permitted limits.
The damage and causes of the fire are unknown so far.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the Kolben Street site.
"This is a fire of a large-scale storage tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamc told us.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we turn off the transport lines from the tanks," she added.
According to the so-called "c" server complicated the shutdown of a malfunctioning hydrant network, the firefighters had to transport the water from somewhere else.
Firefighter's second-degree fire alarm report.
They're a total of four, the fourth in the most serious situations.
Chemicals have also gone to the site to check the level of hazardous substances that could get into the air during the fire.
"But they did not detect in the air the amount of pollutants that exceeded the hygiene standards," the firefighter said.
British police sent Assange a release notice.
The British police today delivered an announcement of the release of the founder WikiLeaks to Juliana Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that he had delivered “an announcement of extradition” to 40-year-old Australan by asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange, under the British law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court this month lifted his appeal against extradition, thus facing extradition to Sweden for charges of sexual crimes.
Because he feared that Stockholm would send him to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June, where he asked for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard “truled a notice of the issuance to a 40-year-old man to whom he asked to arrive at the police station on the day and hour he was assigned,” the speaker said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to provide a notice of release to comment.
Assang is afraid that he will be issued from Sweden to the United States, where he can face espionage charges, as WikiLeaks published 250,000 American diplomatic documents on the website.
Driver got a fine of £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The motorist was fined 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree in Essex was seen in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27th.
When the police stopped him, she found out she had a drink cup between her thighs.
At a police court in Colchester Howie confessed to the charge that he was driving recklessly and recklessly.
Seven points came to his account, resulting in a six-month ban on the procedure.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of £90 and the premium for the accused £100.
As a result of taxes on owners of foreign properties, Prague BublinName
The Ministry of Finance pre-calculated the income tax on financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborn, which, in the 2012 budget, submitted a fee of 7 % for the transfer of property to buildings at the price of over 2 million pounds and an annual fee to buyers who own their real estate within the company, not as individuals.
Income from the property transfer fee in the flat fund in the districts of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which in 2012/13 amounted to £708 million, already exceeding the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: “In view of the increase in the transfer of property to high-value homes and the presentation of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that the high-value assets are undertaxed regardless of the effect of the outdated tax system on the head.”
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy property in London, or that existing owners were reluctant to sell themselves.”
Foremost properties – up to 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price – in a rich band ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded a record increase of 11.8 % last year.
Prices in central London continue to show a steady growth of 5,6 % from year to year, but have been shaded by the flourishing “domestic market” at which the Savills Real estate agency surveyed the Southwest, North (7,4%) and East (6,5%) increases.
Scientists have made it clear how the movements of the tail relate to the mood of the dog
Early studies have shown that happy dogs turn their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs tend to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these delicate differences in tail movements.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, said: “People are well aware that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to the impulses that stimulate positive or negative emotions.”
We've been trying to detect the same thing with other species.
He added that, as in humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information on how dogs react to the disproportionate drilling of tails of other dogs, researchers monitored animals watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently it won't take long to understand why their tail goes one way or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown dog films about dogs – whether in a natural version or in a silhouette form – to get rid of any confusing impulses, and we have also managed to adjust the movement of tail and to illustrate it more to the right or to the left.”
When the animals saw the otherwise inflexible dog move its tail to the right (from the looks of the dog spinning its tail), it remained completely calm.
However, when she recorded the production of tail mostly on the left (the tail from the eye of the dog spinning the tail), their pulse rate increased and the animals acted uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs would communicate consciously through these movements.
Rather, it believes that the dogs learned from experience what moves they must be on and which they do not have to pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and move their tail one way or another, it is repeatedly linked to friendly behavior and the movement of transport is less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a high school animal health teacher at Bristol University, said that it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side of the dog was important.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs were turning their heads to the left when they were watching an aggressive dog, and to the right when they were looking at a cheerful dog.
And in another expert discussion from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dogs were more likely to meet with the dogs when they were turning their tails to the left than to the right, when they were becoming uncertain – precisely the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to him, dogs in these different animal studies may be given a difference by not interpreting animals in films or in dogs as dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“Although there is evidence in many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand why their tail goes one way or the other.
Arctic Monkeys for Alex Turner's illness moved the concert to Glasgow.
The Arctic Monkeys Rock Group moved the concert to Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with mercury inflammation.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform on Friday in the city's Hydro complex.
Alex Turner's main singer's illness, however, forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone the quarterly performance at the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys Group says: “After deciding to postpone today’s performances in the LG arena in Birmingham, and on the basis of medical advice, Arctic Monkeys also has to postpone performances in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November.”
"Alexi Turner has been diagnosed with an inflammation of the mercury, and unfortunately he will not be able to emerge."
The performance in the LG arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances shall remain valid.
We would like to apologize to all those who bought the tickets for the inconveniences that caused them.

Pope Frantisek appoints in February the first cardinal
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Frantisek for the first time named the new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22.
In the clergy of the Catholic Church, the cardinals have the highest position right after the pope and are those who elect the pope, so František will set up his first group of men who will eventually help to choose his successor.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he cannot participate in the pope’s election – the group is shrinking to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report on Friday, Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of the current cardinals known as the conservatory would take place prior to the promotion of new cardinals.
"The Pope Frantisek decided to communicate his decision to convene the February conservatory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from various parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He said that the pope usually names as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of voters to 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age, as he wants.
The convent next year will be significant because the first time Frantisek was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation in Europe and in particular in Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since František established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have been tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Frantisek has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was possible that these cardinals the pope would ask for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before – it is absolutely new.
Valero said that the popes traditionally promoted bishops in the position of cardinals from large places, but Frantisek is “full of surprises – so we do not know who he is. ”
GM is downloading some new light trucks in the USA for repairing backrests
According to a Friday notice from the U.S. Car Security Authority, General Motors is downloading almost 19,000 of its new (2014) light trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to correct a malfunction with manual latch.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism of latching the front seats may be faulty.
As a result, seat backs are not in accordance with federal car safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the National Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that “if the rear car gets hit, the head restraint does not need to protect passengers properly, which increases the risk of injury”.
The downloaded models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
GM placed the supply on the market in June, and this front American car is the most important market entry of the vehicle since the restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the supplier of the failure in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcements to the owners due to the 16-day inability of the government, which in October weakened the increase in car sales.
The supply of Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for 2014 models, rose to about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, on Friday, to GM.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
New York Stock Exchange shares grew by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to 37.47 USD.

It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's about memories of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish the patient's exams tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and took your breath.
The elections ended with a persuasion and television coverage forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates cried for joy, and my parents kept the papers they had found.
A young team of visionaries headed into the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During his introduction to the Authority in 2008, Obama had 82% support.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the present is a tough awakening, like a wake-up call from sleep.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of wasted opportunities.
The years after I dropped my first election ticket, there have really been changes.
It certainly wasn't anything I imagined.
I recognise that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on available care through the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of politics “to ask nothing, to say nothing” after the execution of Usama bin Ladina.
In addition, I believe that the side obstructions have reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: among others, it is immigration reform, the public's choice of health care and the closure of the Guantanamo base.
But after many situations, when I defended Obama's administration from my colleagues and friends, I have reached the absolute limit in terms of explanations that they can provide.
I've found myself in a place of political despair.
The obstructions of the Republics cannot explain their consent to listening to foreign leaders, nor to the raids of unmanned aircraft that kill innocent children overseas.
It is impossible to explain to them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, or that it pursues those who discover the wrong conduct of government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without due process or for restricting public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaign.
They cannot justify finding a report that says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive... of Nixon's administration”.
And most recently, they cannot even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the law on the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if anything like this could be expected.
Whether I knew when I was 18 years old that the power of government could be in conflict with the political campaigns that preceded her.
The vacant function obviously does not have a predictable course and our public talks will form an opposition political party and an emergency such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I cited above appear to be largely the result of my own administrative decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for both of them again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidate.
Mitt Romney was a confused and unsolved alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes that we had heard of.
However, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – through this book is becoming increasingly difficult.
They make me remember the number of promises that have gone missing.
This week, I read in the book a chapter about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton during the primaries in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over a parental leave programme
Billionaire and Member Clive Palmer say that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of the parental leave program, because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Banyan magnate, which is leading the dispute over a $6 million-dollar tax return on coal, made this statement when he tried to mix the question of whether he was in conflict with interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Chamber, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes from coal and mining.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that there could only be ministers in the conflict of interest, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit personally from the policy.
"He has entered a major conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters were to get pregnant, he would be keenly interested in receiving parental leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the election committee officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the fight for a chair for the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast area due to 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the elections are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap details into the computer, vote immediately and have results at half past seven?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is, can results be lost if someone doesn't like it?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Election Commission studied the possibilities for electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political program also applies to the Sunshine Coast airport and would take his new job “very seriously”.
The public office is a public service.
"We do not seek any reward except that we can serve the company at this critical time," he said.
Are you washing your hands?
Scientists have found that they wash your hands with change and trouble.
The experiment was attended by 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve an indeterminate role.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that washed their hands for nothing acted in a much more optimistic way than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with washed hands" did better in the next test than the other one.
Yet, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not have them washed.
The results of "washed" were at the level of a third group whose participants did not record any previous failure.
The results of the test show, according to psychologists, that physical cleanness removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivation is declining, testing must focus much more on other tests.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would probably be more unoptimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After using the WC, not only does the Czech Republic and Czech Republic wash their hands, but it is already a fifth.
They usually lie in the hygiene area after working in the garden or in the workshop, where 85 percent of the people wash their hands.
The pet’s stroke motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, as far as it is necessary to wash your hands after handing out to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks will wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be on the spot, I'm afraid reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," commented researcher Klaudie Komárková.
RBS suspends two merchants with foreign currency
According to two persons notified of the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by supervisory authorities concerning suspected currency market manipulation is increasingly common.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with competent authorities in investigating the world's largest financial market, where they change the holders of $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of an expanding investigation that responds to the manipulation scandal at LIBOR (the London interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our unscrupulous search for this matter continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people who are close to this event said that RBS has transmitted to the UK Financial Authority records of e-mails and quick reports sent from accounts and to former trader accounts.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position as European Foreign Exchange President at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European President of Cash Trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of the Barclays and UBS currency trading, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these merchants was charged with any offense.
Mr Usher's group for sending quick reports included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people who were dedicated to this event said.
UBS stated this week that after the Swiss control authority Finma announced that it had investigated suspicious foreign currency manipulation in several Swiss banks, it had taken steps against some of its employees.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Antimonopoly Office Weko, FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examines the allegations that these bankers have joined in moving the currency market.
People in the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combing themselves with old quick messages and e-mails to find cases of wrongdoing.
Reports of investigations have alarmed merchants in an area that was one of the biggest engines to generate profits at the banks' closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the fact that small volatility of currencies has limited the opportunity for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the gravity of the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market it is virtually impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this does not necessarily have to be true.
A highly built trader said that despite a significant volume of daily trading with a foreign currency, the liquidity exploration between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices”.
The report came on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had released almost USD 6 million from its shareholding department this week, which caused a loss at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperated with their supervisory authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved," said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infected in Prague has exceeded a thousand years.
Doctors in Prague have recorded more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the monitoring in 1986 until the end of this third quarter, the tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This results from statistics from the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,063 people have been infected in the entire Czech Republic.
396 Immunity failures have already occurred.
198 people died.
The number of people infected in the Czech Republic has increased annually over the past decade.
In 2002, the tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new diseases and then 180 in 2010.
In the previous year, the number dropped to 153 last year, but it was a record one.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"There is no doubt in my mind that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light to patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, the tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavatý.
In September, 21 new patients and three patients were registered by doctors.
From the start of the surveillance until the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has broken out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to meet a town should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk by a decorated centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would reveal the bedecret.
Many people are "readers of graves."
They slowly wander the cemetery and gain an intimate view of local reality.
They find out how people live here, what nationalities, what faiths are, how large and consistent families belong, how old they die, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social standing as they taste.
And from the grave's condition, they'll find out how the dead care about the rest of them.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama’s Law on Health Care
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Law on Health, signed by Barack Obama, is in line with the Constitution, which is a major victory for Obama's administration.
On the ratio of voice 5:4 the Court ruled that the Individual Regulation of the Protection of Patients and Available Care Act – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatens to pay the fine – does not oppose the Constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
The President of the Court, John Roberts, stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining part of the Law on 2700 pages and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which orders States to extend the possibility of obtaining hospital insurance, in the other case threatens to abandon all financing of hospital insurance from federal sources, is not enforceable and contrary to the Constitution.
In order to block this law, 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises filed an action.
During the 2012 primacy, the law strongly rejected each of the major Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a lame donkey" no longer threatens prison, the court annulled the law.
Until now, Zimbabwe has had to pay good attention to what the public has been talking about the nine-eight-year-old Mugabe, which has been ruling the country since the early 1980s, and since the end of 1987, it has been facing it.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Law, a fine of $100 was threatened by the contempt of the Presidential Office, up to one year’s imprisonment.
"The representatives of the State should not be strongly accused of people commenting on the President in pubs or in other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal against the court's decision, informed the British BBC.
Against the law, a number of damaged Zimbabweans were identified loudly, among them Tendai Danga, whom the police arrested two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May he ended up in prison an opposition activist worshiping in the public of Mugabe with a "cool donkey".
In August, the D.A. charged a six-year-old man with intent to use Robert Mugabe's face poster as toilet paper.
The Court of Justice has also declared anti- constitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later prove false," said Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malal.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to twenty years in prison.
"The existence of the law to criminalize someone for false statements has a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has been ruling the country with a firm hand for more than 33 years, a new constitution with wider civil liberties has been adopted in March of Zimbabwe on the basis of a referendum.
The small steps from the dictatorship of one man came into the country in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiray to the prime minister chair.
However, the world continues to suffer from the economic crisis and, until 2008, the world's highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 per cent.
Therefore, in 2009 the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today only currencies of other States apply in Zimbabwe.
The impoverished economy is in the midst of Mugabe's reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with walking farts.
Central banks will maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Fede, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument enabling banks to access global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks put it in their joint statement.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the main international economist of the London Bank of Barclays.
"I will take all the transitional instruments of this type gradually became permanent, so it is not in my opinion any surprise," says Vojtěch Benda, the main economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers reinforce the bonds that began to arise in 2007 when the international credit market first squandered.
Central Bank agreements have enabled access to euro, dollars and other currencies for anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to conclude its support programme for the US economy, which could drive the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract shall be used as a standard to overcome the liquidity shortfall of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the other currency is currently exceeded.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and borrowing of the other currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on bank supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
But then I didn't finish it because someone on the website was sitting there who couldn't complete the registration on the Internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration went down, and then I moved in and that changed my address and number of the civil licence.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that I couldn't, because I have another number of the IP, the address, and that it just couldn't be finished and that I should ask for data deletion and make a new registration.
I have therefore done so and I have written on 24.10.2013 technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable Act on the protection of personal data.
A long day has been written to me by technical support that I have to complete my registration at the branch.
This started an e-mail marathon for technical support, where after the 4th Ugandan 25.10., they wrote that personal data at my request were erased.
So you'd think he could do that new registration, and here the problems started again, it was written to me first that my user name was already occupied (the hat wasn't deleted - it's not personal data, but eventually deleted this too).
So I used a different username and it came out to me that my personal data have already been stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they store something that claims to have been erased?), so again I contacted technical support.
On my question, how could it be written to me that personal data actually erased 25.10. to send an e-mail with that error.
That's what I did (about 15 o'clock yesterday) and today they wrote to me that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that's why it's not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I've been in touch with technical support for a week and I'm talking to them about how it still isn't working.
And what if the truth is what they say (as it isn't) no one can register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22 I actually registered myself, on the same name and date of birth, but I used an imaginary e-mail and phone number and the worlds wonders, it appeared to me that the website that they emailed me a link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible when you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds registration to e-mail and phone number and data just didn't delete what they said.
So I once again told this technical support that they just lie (whether intentionally or not they know what they're writing), because what they're writing isn't true.
I've documented several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. So "false" registration on this simply doesn't affect.
I'm sorry, but since you've been reregistered, we can't verify your claims.
And he's finished communication.
Respectfully repeats the same sentence as that of the registration to be binding on the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and thus did not even take place.
So if I sum it up, Tipsport not only did not delete the data as he claims, but he still lies when he says otherwise.
Worse yet, it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like a mistake is on the customer's side.
By the way, after I put this matter on my personal blog, things got a little bit in motion and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter is being transmitted for verification and I will be informed (after a week of regency and guessing and warning of the same error).
Music plays in the subway on the Bridge
The transport company in Prague launched the project Music in Metro.
The first vest, where reproduction instrumental music plays continuously during the subway operation, is the Bridge of Line A on the Vaclav Square exit.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double-jump, band and three singers
The writer Michal Horáček brought not only his new two-CD Czech calendar to the hall of the Kolínsky Municipal Social House, but especially among us singers Lenka Noová, František Segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the excellent orchestra Matěje Benka.
After the initial intro and the acting story about the late musician, Michal Horáček invited all three singers to the stage, himself came up with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of the last time they played in Cologne and the theater and the electric current fell out throughout the city.
"On the other hand, in Cologne they produced two kinds of cards that I had come into contact with," he recalled.
So did the father of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could make a tour of the Ensigns or Dúbravac at Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical composition.
The calendar also made by Josef Mánes, who put him on the eagle, about ice hockey, but at the time, he had no idea how we met in those squares, and we're chanting, who doesn't jump, there's no Czech.
That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we're not here today," he entertained.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang for him a very good night's sleep, sang at night, and accompanied her to a guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played the percussion, then all three singers accompanied the band in the composition of the keyboard, cello, guitar and contrabass.
All three vocalists were singing together a little bit of a blow job in the heartstream, which immediately blew up the vigil.
"I'm glad that the song captured you, which didn't surprise me in Kmooch's town," Michal Horáček responded.
After remembering Peter Hapku, I was told by Franz Segrada, who was originally rewarded by Richard Müller with a huge applause, Hana Heger again reminded me of Dad’s song, he loved Líd Baar and Horáčková’s explanation of the Communist ban and the replacement of Baar’s American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb again reminded the composition of Sebastian, Segrado then sang a beautiful song Prague zhrubněna Jardo Svoboda, zasmukýrodak and former Kolíňák.
But that was already the conclusion, applause in standing and addition in the form of optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
Another addition was prepared on the playlist, but the fans no longer applauded.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire square sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CDs, Michal Horáček his books and even the packaging from the legendary LP and with any interested people also took pictures.
Berdikha with Štěpánek complements Rosol and Hájek
At the finals of Davis' cup against Serbia he nominated the non-Czech tennis captain Jaroslav Navrátil square Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they go to play on the playground of the rival to the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the finals, the Czechs are the third in the last five years.
"We know we're going to hot ground, it's going to be wild, and we have to focus on our performance as always."
"We'll go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the officer of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
The American Commandant in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelites showed exactly what the bombing of Syria was supposed to look like.
Without unnecessary humbuk, threats and millions of statements, planes were sent, they hit the target and returned.
Without letting them screw around by official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and no longer express themselves.
The exact opposite of confused and large-scale, acts of undisputed Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying of all the attacks was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media mess with their claims that "sir base" or "the supply to Hizbalah" was bombed.
I wrote recently about the fact that while the assistance of the US to the secular insurgents in the country remains on a rhetorical plane, Russia continues to be happy to deliver weapons to Syria.
And just a fresh shipment of Russian rockets at the port of Latakija became the target of Israel's attack.
A very clear message.
And notice, Israel again bombed Assad's regime, not the insurgent, although it should be the opposite according to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has marked 2 members of the Special Forces, probably the Delta Force.
It had not been known until now that they were distinguished during the attack on an American consulate in Bengaz.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA area in the city is known to me as members of a CIA secret commander who is made up of former soldiers.
For a long time, there was speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in another CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA in Libya has its offices protected by machine guns (the story of one such both members of the SEALs perished after the hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising are the information about those two unknown heroes so far.
They were part of an American command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received a report of an attack in Benghaz, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, shot their way into the CIA area in Benghaz.
Obama's administration is overshadowed by the fact that during the attack it was not officially deployed and the whole and that it simply hesitated to do so.
The commanding officer will probably release these volunteers without orders.
However, the fact that the country does not operate on a one-time basis, but permanently the US Commandant, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently nothing has officially been admitted, and even now it's just some NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is a good thing that the United States is half trying to counter terrorism in Libya.
Even though it would be much more helpful to solve the national situation.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It's not so long ago that the media was almost singing Iran's air force to pursue American drones.
Little is known, however, about how the Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to find your drone in the airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
However, if the Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian aircraft F-4 Phantom was tracking an American drone in the international area above the sea, when there might have been the first sharp deployment of the US super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He wired Phantom to have his weapon checked optically without being registered with Phantom on the radar, or he just noticed it, and then when he suddenly showed up to him and called the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without a whisper.
No wonder Phantom is an aircraft of American production, but he remembers war in Vietnam.
He can't compare to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzeň can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has been failing most recently, the defender or publisher Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that brought him back a year later.
He's got shooters, he's got a lot of activity, and after the raid, a fine kick was ordered in the game in Teplice.
Victoria took the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but in the end one point was taken from these two duels.
Frantisek Rajtoral believes that his team will break down the unpleasant series in a match with Jablonce.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises Frantisek Rajtoral.
Males play a hard fight with the Northmen who play an assault football, they prepare carefully.
Everything goes to the game with Jablonce, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw much of the video game opponent.
"I believe it will be a great game on Friday night," attracts Czech fan representatives to Doosan Arena stands.
The last few games didn't go as well as she would want, but the word of the crisis is rejected by the defender Victoria.
So it goes in football, sometimes you have a good form and sometimes it gets worse again.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," says Western defender.
Victoria's men will again rely on fans to support them.
"It's playing Friday night, and that's what I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," says Rajtoral.
Jana Pítová, step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, it's a big leap -- a leap a few years back, into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like, having no worries, and just coming out of school and washing dishes, luxuries and doing your homework.
Although these "compulsions" were mostly just theories, wishes of parents.
Practice was completely different - running from school, throwing a bag in the corner and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump a drink.
Then, during the Helena show and her boys sew up the Christmas dress for Grandma for her birthday.
And then, after several warnings, finally wash the dishes, pour out, in the winter, apply the wood into the tiled stones and tasks to do until after dark under the lamp (or rely on the classmate and instead of writing the loved verses addressed to the school love).
In the morning, eat homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not such jams that are sold now, whose contents are next to strawberries or not lying) and drink it with tea from dried herbs that my mother and I liked to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when the tomb silence was in the room when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on tapes that were rolling loudly in my mom's old cassette book.
And then on the pencil, we crossed those tapes and we kept playing the same song, our favorite song, and we had a syphony to it.
Or we telephoned over the table using cans that were tied to each other with a string - and once we were on the phone to get better, we had to clean our ears thoroughly, and then the breakout was a match and a bath.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents have been able to live by the fact that we missed nothing.
We didn't need any iPhones, even Paddy phones and laptops or brand clothes.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best "push" in the wardrobe was the batted T-shirt of domestic production using SAVA.
From the electronics, we were satisfied with the tape recorder mentioned by Mom and Walkman, which we shared with our sister, and which, by the way, we used only on a train on a school trip.
It's come to be more interesting to play with Aunt Hop or Man, don't be angry, or how I said to go "just" out.
By the time I was a little older, we had a video player under the tree, and I’m sure my parents had been saving him for a long time, but unfortunately, he hadn’t warmed up with us for a long time.
My little sister threw a cleavage into him, said he was so beautiful, she tried to get the tapes, if he'd even dropped a cleavage.
I'm afraid I've been staring, but it was his last bite.
Well, and this is an accident today, you poor thing, on a plate from your dad all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she put a bullet in the video and thought she was gonna play it and not play it, so she still can't bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate, make arrangements without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I had a date with my neighbor's granddaughter on vacation with my grandmother, when we would meet again next summer at grandma's - and so it was, so it paid.
We're out.
Will you promise someone to see you in a year?!
I also remember the winter when we were running out with the whole village, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill near a church on bags of sleeping bags.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, my sister and I used to listen to the famous saying before every dinner, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have any soap tied in the bathroom to the tap in the lemon web.
After dinner, when Dad worked in the garage for a beer with Jarda from the village, Mom and I lay on the floor, leaned our feet on a tile stone, opened the door and watched the fire and listened to the cracking of the wood that came from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't write daily messages through various chat rooms, texts.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew far more about ourselves.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I complement these memories by looking at the album, where they are carefully glued with black corners caused by black and white photos.
And if I didn't know how old I was then, the back of the picture was always written a year ago.
I'm looking at the fact that the cuts from the pot didn't look very good, and we had a cousin's pants two numbers bigger, no one ever laughed at us before, it was so normal (not even IN).
And I'd better get back to that step forward -- reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting for the modern era to come up with, like, one for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me are for a young generation so at least a hundred years behind monkeys now, and I think they lose a lot of weight that they won't survive this "preliminary" time either.
I wish they would!
Google, Samsung and Huawei are sued for Nortel patents
The Group, which owns thousands of patents by Nortel’s disappeared company, filed a complaint Thursday for infringement of the patent against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company that was overstated in its auction in the context of Nortel’s bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which purchased Nortel patents for USD 4.5 billion, applied to the US District Court in Texas for a patent violation of Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include a technology that helps link the expressions searched for on the Internet with the relevant advertising, states the action, which is the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately caught.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that operate on Google Android’s operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a default bid of USD 900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the battle for patents Nortel, Google won $12.5 billion by Motorola Mobility, which was a partly motivated business of Motorola patents.
“In spite of the failure to obtain patents that are the subject of the dispute in the auction, Google patents have violated and continue to infringe," the action states.
Rockstar seeks an increased compensation for damage from Google because it considers that Google patent breach is intentionally alleged to be a violation.
Miloslava Cipková: November smile
She came outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she postponed her smile, the one who kept on holding back as a defense against the love of friendly surroundings.
That made her very relieved because it was a mask she decided not to lay off in public.
He was honest at home only the days when she was a grandmother and had a grandchild named Elinka or Adzik around him.
And, of course, when her sons called.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless business skills courses.
Now they're really good at it.
So she won't knock her closest.
Then he went to the corner.
It's like a disguise on a masquerade.
November, no other month can make that miracle smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one that's been gone for almost three years.
Egypt brings the first freely elected President to office
Muhammad Mursi made an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day is hard to end political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursí promised “new Egypt” when he was presented to the office as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husne Mubarak, who was cast down 16 months earlier.
In his introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Murcia also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made an oath to 18 judges dressed in black tentacles in a mansion built with a view to the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are working for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which has been an illegal organization for the most part 84 years since its creation as a result of the sharp attacks of individual governments.
When Mursi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. in a small convoy of cars, hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the court building to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak's presidential show, the transport period was only briefly stopped so that the colony could travel on a busy road connecting the city's centre with suburbs to the south.
The personal prestige of Mursi, ridiculed as the non-charismatic “reserve tires” of the Muslim Brotherhood, grew sharply from his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him not only as an Islamist candidate but also to bring all those who want to the end of rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to a judge in a wooden chamber, where he took an oath.
Mursi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to present an inauguration speech.
While he was standing by, he received an official welcome from a military band that played a national anthem.
The military commander of the Field Marshal Husajn Tantaví was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the scandal “Armada and the people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The university in Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education, and later in the 1970s it became a bast of Islamic student movements.
Murcia made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a revolution was born, which ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak last year, and solemnly promised to seize the presidential powers taken over by his office by the military council, which took them away from the exiled leader.
But I agree with the official oaths made before the court, rather than before the parliament, as is customary, he consented to the will of the army, suggesting that the fight for power would continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There'll be police specialists in the ghettos to relieve the tension.
Police specialists should act in future in ghettos in the Czech Republic.
They'd spend half of their funerals here.
They'd look after order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and people from the surrounding areas.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior considers this to be the case.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would mainly help to "accelerate social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and quarters in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people in them, mainly Roma.
Adults in ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
It was a bad deal.
According to the experts at the problem locations, in the meantime, it arrived at 100.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are increasing.
Anti-Roma marches took place in several places.
Extremists were also added to the neighborhood.
According to the inside, it is difficult for the police in areas with the ghettos to maintain security and order.
The basic condition is "consistent application of equal access to enforceability".
But it is said that it is impossible to achieve this without the detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go for walks in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest would serve in his circuit.
He'd be in charge of order in a troubled area.
He would also know locals, so he could deal with problems or transgressions better.
"Thanks to built-up trust will be easier for specialists to prevent a number of illegal acts," said the inside.
Specialists in ghettos would be charged 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into troubled areas is to consist of Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (about 15.5 million crowns now).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is expected to take place by 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the authors said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it is not clear yet.
The answer is to give an analysis that determines where a special officer is needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release on an annual basis after the project is completed.
According to the project proposal, first of all, the officers selected are performing an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should pass through this training annually.
They'll be the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special training for police officers who will act in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
They say it should motivate and lead to integration.
It's supposed to have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller flats.
Higher standard would have social housing comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to implement an integration plan to build social workers with them.
They should follow the rules of accommodation, take care of their health, send their children to schools, retrain themselves and actively look for work.
If they tried to get involved, they would go to a higher standard of living.
According to the interior, the system should work for at least 30 years until the next generation of "in an integrated environment".
The social housing model is being prepared by resorts for local development and work.
They have to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drabek: Carbon Summit - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The carbon peak is a spectacular hill 3 km south-east of Bruntal.
Along with several others is a recent evidence of the sophistication of activities in the Low Jeseník at a time (from a geological point of view).
The last eruptions were here at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a greater distance, on the top of the Uhlířský peak is a distinctive white painted baroque pilgrim church of the Virgin Mary A helpful, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden chaplain.
The host who stood next to the church didn't behave.
Shortly after the church was completed, an alley of four rows of lip was planted, about 1 km long.
The crucifix road at the Uhlířské vrh is already the third version, originally here after 1916, the second one, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden plastics, which was produced by the local art sculptor František Nedomel.
He used various types of wood from the Low Autumn region.
Similarly, the base of the miners from the region here forms an interesting geological exhibit.
The name of the sponsor shall be entered on each stop.
The carbon summit is the rest of the young volcano.
Although data from radiometric measurements differ somewhat, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudny (below 3.3 million years of age) and older than Venus volcano (below 0.8 million years of age).
The volcano was born an explosion.
In her case, she cast out a considerable amount of sop ash along with fragments of rock from the ground that the burning gained red-coloured color.
At the end of this phase, it ran to the surface of the lava - today it is a layer of a straight hook up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption cast red, brown, and places up to the black tufts.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the gap.
In the tuphees there are obvious volcanoes up to 1 metre, and the second eruption was finished with the outpouring of the lava.
To conclude the activity of the volcano, a lava, which now forms up to 50 m of a powerful layer of a jet pack, ran out of the volcano.
Soups that alter the discharge of volcanoes with lava discharges are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they're actually composed of layers, they got the name stratovulcans.
The original sophisticated cone was subjected to a gradual erosion.
However, he was threatened by mining in a quarry on the south side.
The most intensive work was done here in 1953 - 1962.
Tufts were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The challenge has been brought to a halt under the pressure of experts and the public, thus preserving this unique place.
The problem, however, is the propriety and the small consistency of the mountains, which are rapidly winding up, falling apart and sliding down the slopes.
Lom's disappearing so fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, southern-oriented slope is ideal for some rare species of plants and animals.
The axle is therefore problematic, but it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile in time.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are kept on a number of important sites.
You will get to the Horny Hill after a green tourist sign from Bruntal, or Slezsky Kočov.
Automobile drivers can use the unpaid parking lot at the beginning of the July alley, where even a short science trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a land villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts in the Orechovec.
The original owners of the house, however, obtained it back in the restaurant, and the tenants had to move away with a small distance.
So Ivana quickly sought a replacement home for herself and her elderly mother back then.
From the acquaintances she got a tip on apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but the look from the fourth floor on a vast forest park and the dam inspired me on the other side," Ivana recalls at the first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a three-year commission.
"Today we live here for more than 13 years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a 20-foot apartment to a smaller apartment of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The event was not simple, things were stored with friends and gradual arrangements lasted almost a year.
The new apartment was in a pretty good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be made, such as door painting or window replacement.
The previous owner blew up the core, but the owner did most of the exercises unpractically handled and unnecessaryly large atrium, and the small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created multifunctional living space.
Architects used to define individual zones and divide the room with a sadocarton that allowed a new location of the lights.
The first intervention she made after a few years was the removal of the bar in the living room.
This changed the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
The next step to partially improve the standard was to replace the floor from PVC with laminate.
You didn't know what to do with Ivan's bathroom.
For years, I've been collecting magazines about living and searching for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So on the recommendation, I addressed young architect Kamila Doudzer.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the renovation of the bathroom, it was possible to modify the available forearms at the same time.
The architect connected the room toilet and the bathroom and two doors with open wings replaced with one sliding space, saving the place.
The bathroom is timeless and also quite barrier-free.
High-quality coatings mimic the sandstone, plus a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet shower next to the toilet.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Doudder continued.
In the course of the show How to build the dream was a quick but fundamental change of the living room, which was also attended by architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, dining, living room and sleeping in the space created by a combination of two smaller rooms, without helping each other with the classic principles of optical division, a pile of semi-circles or Japanese walls.
"This would, as a result, violate the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.
It was possible to initially separate the sleep and the living part.
All you had to do was turn your back on two sofas, and between them, you put a glass of feathers in place.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and the painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and the dining corner, the architect used quality marble, the sliding door revived with a patterned wallpaper.
The kitchenette shall cover, if necessary, the sliding panels with the wallpaper.
The new floor of an antiallergic marmole has a number of advantages compared to the previous laminate: softening non-sparing surface and better sound insulation.
The system of deformations and subsoils from the tarpaulin highlighted by color is an example of how the panel can be used to work with space.
I left the colors on the architects, I wish it were happy.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," Ivana says.
The engraving of the engraving with the motif of the blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energy tone, architects chose a white, which underlined a modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books could be stored, among other things, in the space under the window windows.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled in the distance.
In a redesigned interior, there is an excellent contrast between the new one and the older one, for example, with the tens of years old crystal mirror and the quality of art that Ivana collects all her life.
Last one came in the kitchen.
The lockers were previously placed on both sides, and the owner looked a little bit like in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and repositioned their location.
The furniture in simple design is made for a custom, the white area softens slightly perletal surface.
The small space was made possible by an ideal solution for the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
In view of the small kitchen, the glass roof of the walls was restored above the workboard.
The unique graphics with digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is maintained perfectly.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia, which resembled her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now it seems she's happy here.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and sink, in the new owner chose the neutral shade of the cover.
The big shower cabin has the Ronal glass door.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
The interior has been materially and colourfully unified and we have tried its elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and availability of items of daily needs," says Kamila Doudírová.
The Supreme Court ruled: Sometimes it is possible to prosecute.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Peter could also be prosecuted for any criminal offence that might have been committed prior to the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former Members of the ODS Ivana Fuxy, Mark Šnajdra and Peter Tluchora, on the contrary, decided that they could not be punished for any criminal offence until last November's surrender to the MP's mandate, said the spokesman of the Supreme Court, Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the Court rejected the motion of the Attorney-General, Iva Iszjan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for surrendering their mandate and not making problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to pursue the former prime minister who offered them these posts.
With Mr. Barto, an anti-corruption police officer was also arrested.
Bart's defender Oldrich Chudob, who also represented him in the causation of alleged VV corruption, also did not want to express himself too much in the case, but he said: "Yes, I represent the client in this case, but, given the protection of classified facts, I cannot comment on it any further."
According to the information, the Law of the case deals with the General Security Council Inspection (GIBS).
The server said Barta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server of First Communion.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment to Bart was allegedly sought.
Latest information The Law, however, shows that the arrest of Víta Barta and Peter Lessy is not connected.
The police director Eva Kropáčová refused to comment on the case of the Prague city council.
"We will not comment on this question in the light of the protection of classified facts," Zěpánka Zenklov, spokesman for the Municipal State Department in Prague, said on Friday.
It is there that the prosecutor of Bart's case is overseeing the matter, and, therefore, it is indirectly apparent from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under the secrecy regime.
Reporter Novinek managed to catch the wife of Víta Berta Kateřina in the morning before their residence in Prague’s Klara.
She was just putting her bags in her car and leaving.
To the whole event, she refused to express herself.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Okamura Dawn movement spoke to Bart's arrest.
He has no idea what's going on in his bail.
"Viet Bart was one of many candidates for many parties on our candidate, and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the dawn of direct democracy Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Barta, who, in the previous early elections to the House in Pilsen region, has been unsuccessfully running for the movement of the dawn of direct democracy Tomia Okamura, is known for his corrupt causation of Members of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was unlawfully sentenced to 18 months with a stay of 30 months.
Next, the verdict was changed and Bart was dismissed.
I want a contract at the NHL.
I still have juice, lust and enthusiasm.
For the Prospas, family was always first, so she wants to give her full support at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas, and he's going to extend his career, or he's definitely gonna end up with hockey.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still in vain waiting for an offer.
Despite being a declared worker who will never cheat on anything.
Despite the fact that he leaves his heart on the ice every day and is able to cut off fellow players.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive Columbus player in the past season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he says decisively.
He may be waiting, allegedly, for him is the New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and also have wounded two opponents Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does your arrival in Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know an article in the New York Post magazine said they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere was it ever added that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Didn't you hear from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a standby basis.
That's where it comes into the situation where the contract really comes in.
When, for example, a wounded player or someone can't do it, and the manchaft doesn't blink.
There's a lot of different factors that have to come together to get the contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York, isn't there?
The wounded is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't get into the season, so there's a chance there, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
But the second thing is, you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten any yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
On Friday you fly to America, are you expecting something to shut up?
I have the expectations since July 5th, when the free-player market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm not. I'm going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and the day we see each other again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
He's given me to be a father and a husband, and that's what makes everything go away.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a deal and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna be doing my dad and my husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
There's two hockey games for yours on Sunday, which is a holiday for me and my whole family, if we can go and support our kids in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this on full-time tickets?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This could happen too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 rounds of knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it too much.
One day it's going to get into a phase like this, that all the goals, the winnings and the drawers won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Make sure you have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could have happened to me besides my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, the first place - except for the family - is also a sporting success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, so sorry, our children - my wife and I - grew up in the States, started going to school and so on.
And we'd love for them to continue this trend.
Because what we're going to talk about is there are options in America all over the place.
That's the chance we should offer them.
So are you planning to stay in America permanently?
We're going to practice this as of now.
This means that in summer we will be in Czech Republic in the Deep and Near České Budějovice.
And in winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It's totally perfect to be warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say I went across from him, it cost him a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That we can choose where to live with our wife.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to do this so that they can choose what to do and how to live.
How long will you have at your age to train, train, and wait for an offer?
Yeah, so that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the excitement, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay there.
You can't plan that.
So you can say you're gonna wait for this season to come out and then decide what's next?
I'm at the stage when I go from day to day.
The CEO of ČEZ recently announced that the decision to build the Temelín power plant was postponed to the end of 2014 or 2015.
It was justified by waiting for a new State Energy concept and by agreeing to Contracts of Difference by the government.
These are the reasons why CEZ's current leadership is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to a major shareholder.
A qualified manager, however, should make recommendations to shareholders and not hide behind him.
I only rule with Sobotka.
Andrej Babish begins to agree that his ANO movement will have no time to learn the political trade in opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government in order to create anything at all.
The President ANO accepted this in the interview for Law, which will come out tomorrow.
Trading and marketing of ŠkoFIN leads Abrahamek
Its competence includes product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Human Shantor in his post.
Abrahamek has linked his career with the automotive sector for the past 14 years.
He served in Toyota Motor Czech, followed by Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the brand and dealers of Alfa Romeo for seven years.
Its last resort was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which over five years he held the position of manager of the automotive division.
ŠkoFIN was founded in 1992.
Police evacuated part of Los Angeles airport due to shooting.
There was a shooting at the Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
The police evacuated part of the airport because of this, allegedly a terminal of three.
The Reuters Agency's appeal to California media claims that men of the law shot an armed man's gun.
The Los Angeles Times, with a reference to the police, stated that there was a gunfight in which two to three members of the Transport Safety Authority were injured.
How many people were injured and whether there were any victims, but it's still not obvious.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more injuries.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
They were supposed to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft allegedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakiya on Thursday.
With the appeal to the no-name agents of the U.S. government, it was announced by CNN.
The Israeli press reported extensively on the explosion in the alleged warehouse missile, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
The speaker of the Israeli army refused to comment on the CNN inquiry.
"We do not express ourselves to foreign media reports," she said.
Israel’s attack was followed by a missile and related equipment, which, according to the U.S. government source, could be transported to the military movement of Lebanon by Hizbollah.
In response to a call from the AP agency to another US security agent, it reported that Russian rockets SA-125 were the target target of Israel’s attack on the Syrian territory.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defence system.
Satellite images of the area of attack, but according to the DPA, showed the batteries of Russian S-125 Neva rockets.
In addition, they were told to see the battery of the SA-3 rockets, including the command center with radar to track missiles and their targets.
According to the Israeli television report, the rockets have reached 35 kilometers [35 km] and could carry 70 kilograms [70 kg] of heads.
At least twice this year Israel has reportedly bombed the delivery of rockets inside Syria, listed CNN and AP.
The Israeli army never responded to such reports, but repeatedly declared that it would affect any supply of weapons designated by Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company updated the annual profit estimates and expects record profits from the recruits in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic profit before tax to be between 325 and 340 million USD compared to 305 to 315 million USD from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17% increase in record profit of USD 290.4 million from 2011/12.
The Director-General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre had created an eight-percent profit in the first half of the year and that the second half had begun to grow primarily in the Australian and British travel out of service.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards a record annual profit before interest and taxation," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which is traditionally our greatest profit maker.
Business with recreational activities took place in Australia during the second half of the year, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in Great Britain Flight Centre did well in the recreation area, while business clients spent less.
The US trade recovered during the season’s weaker half-years and is expected to bring a third in a number of year’s profits.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protesting the planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
Today, AFP has reported on this by appealing to Greenpeace's international environmental organization.
At the same time, she claims that the original indictment of her piracy activists has not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent campaign against the oil rig in the Arctic were transported from the Murmansk correctional facility to the Petrohrad prison," the organisation announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned move.
The environmental authorities first accused them of piracy, which, if convicted, threatened them for up to 15 years in prison.
Last week, however, they announced that this charge would be replaced by a milder barrage, for which the penalty with the upper limit of seven years would be reduced.
Greenpeace, however, noted in today's statement that the prosecutions of piracy had not yet withdrawn, as promised.
I hear that means the arrests are now accused of two crimes.
Last week, the powerful Investigations Committee announced that the prosecution of piracy would be replaced by a barrage charge.
But when 30 prisoners stood before the committee this week, the prosecution of piracy was not withdrawn.
Instead, a new indictment was brought against everyone," the AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries on the Gazprom oil platform in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship that sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
On terms of imprisonment, environmentalists complain.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo according to the AFP said today that moving to St Petersburg would facilitate meetings with families and consular staff.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they may be worse," he remarked.
The Dutch King Willem-Alexandra asked for help from one of Faiza Oulahsen's detained activists.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called for him to speak about their situation during the planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It states that Malikí has a large share in the reconstruction of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is often also part of fighting in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, at least one Shakespeare game, 19th century novelty, romantic poetry, and current British fiction will have to be studied since 1914.
The test will also include “secret text” to motivate for deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a senior language exam and will be selected to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new basis tomorrow for English and mathematics – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other essential items, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, together with a new system of marking and a smaller amount of projects for students.
In his summer speech, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there is “a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the trust of society”, and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation exam is “more demanding, ambitious and stricter”.
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
To compare school in Australia, the mathematicians spend an average of 143 hours a year and about 138 in Singapore.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, the coalition sources have indicated that a comprehensive math exam – together with greater emphasis on this subject in the result sheets – will probably encourage schools to provide extra training.
The curriculum will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
Ostrava's Prime Minister Kainar: The cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, the long-stretched dispute between the two wings fighting for influence inside the Ostravan ČSSD was overextended.
Everything culminated in the appeal of the Prime Minister of Ostrava, Peter Kainar, to court for the undemocratic assembly of candidates.
Even so, the causses did not want to express themselves too much, so that the party would not be injured before the elections.
But now the voter's voices are numbered.
The management of Ostrava's ČSSD so immediately on Monday evening called on the Prime Minister of Ostrava to step aside, and he will probably press for his function to be lost.
But Peter Kainar wants to keep fighting.
What disputes are about, and who is on whose side, described in an exclusive conversation for Denik.
How do you feel about the outcome of the elections?
The ČSSD certainly counted on a much better result.
Did it hurt her in our house to deal with the media disputes inside the party before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election outcome.
But on the other hand it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now.
It's a side that has its internal problems, it's internally ill, and people see it as not all right in it.
In the election, they made it clear.
What are the internal diseases of ČSSD?
I think the ODS has been going through a decline for a while, and unfortunately, things like this are happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their premonitions at the ODS, moved to and influence the people in the ČSSD.
It then relates to the fact that police and computer-gathering are going to the offices of the Ostrava Magistrate.
This shows that the ČSSD is not composed only of people who would like the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two incomparable camps and in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Haskovtsi and Sobotkovci.
But it's been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a foregleam of what is now happening in Prague.
The Haskov’s wing gradually assumed positions so that after the elections, the situation would weaken Sobotkov’s wing.
A person is in politics in a situation where he sometimes has to compromise.
But everyone has an internal border where the compromises can no longer be made, and that's my case.
At first, I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside of the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotk's wing as Prime Minister of Ostrava.
Haskov's wing did, though, give us a trace.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, and not Michal Hasek?
Slavek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and to some extent also about visions for the party and for this country.
I admit I didn't hear anything like that on the other hand.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the Chairman of the Party.
It is a struggle for power regardless of everything and the positions of the party.
In my opinion, what Michal Hasek has done in Prague has ended his political career.
How you felt that you were not approved by the CSSD leadership in your candidate.
Political parties are based on the competition, which will be placed as their members.
The competition should be largely based on programme visions and on the ability of these people to fill those visions.
Of course, in this competition, people who do not have the ability or the vision, but the political party, for them, is an elevator for money that they would not have gotten elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start to get to the front because they break the rules without crucifixes, they break the parties' statutes.
They are making their practices out of the political parties of the mafia and, in my opinion, are also violating the laws of the Czech Republic.
It is more important for me to note this problem than to consider whether a Caynar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin respecting the statutes.
Is that why you filed a motion before the elections for a preliminary measure against the CSSD candidate in the Moravian Silesian Region?
The current CSSD Regional Executive Committee in Ostrava is strengthening its power by the fact that the organisations that do not comply with it can cancel, purposely set up a new organisation, gradually expels the uncomfortable members of the Party.
An example is the fact that they wanted to expel Richard Bednarek from the deputy club, but he filed an action against it, and then they decided to cancel his expulsion.
This shows that it is the last option to assume compliance of the parties through the courts, but at a time when the other methods and inspection bodies inside the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The attempt to lead the Ostrava-based ČSSD led by Ambassador Adam Rykalou is to withdraw you from the post of Prime Minister.
It's a public secret that the mayor of Poruba Lumer Palyza has a lock on this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumer Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me back.
They promise people positions, they get voices, and then they strengthen their power in the hand for those voices.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around Banik Ostrava's football club and buying the Bazaly Stadium was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was staged to qualify me as a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
The city, however, bought property that is strategically of great value to him.
How, then, do you see this further with your endurance as a prime minister?
The Periodic Committee has already called on me and others on Monday to consider our stay in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like when a thief screams, catch the thief!
When we look at the results of my work in the last eleven years, I don't see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy who initiates and promotes, sometimes even against the members of the party, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
Yet, everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it other than that I'm preventing others from sneaking into the places they want.
Will you continue to fight against these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, it must also work well by the political parties.
It's hard to believe that any side will be able to drive the state effectively if they can't drive themselves.
I am not thinking that I would now leave the ČSSD because I think that the one who causes this party's cancer is not me, but these people who are trying to annoy me.
Olomouc opens in the historical centre of the public plywood
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Burnen stated that the preparatory work on the glider site was started on October 26th and the ice-making unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters strong and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The plywood has an area of 375 square metres, and the stage took 358 square metres.
The skaters and passersby will also have two tables with punch.
"We expanded the floor area, increased the space before the walls, and almost the whole floor area is covered so that the skaters can move comfortably," described Burnen.
The streets of Olomouc already resemble the coming Christmas.
Last year the skating rink was installed right before the main entrance of the town hall in Upper square.
Correction of the Lower square was completed on the slope of the summer, so the ice area could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could have shrieked right in front of the council in 2009, when the airstrip was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, part of which is a rich cultural program, will start a month before Christmas Day on the Upper Square.

Brutal murder of a senior in Zlinsk will be re-examined by a regional court.
The Regional Court would have acquitted the defendant of the 25-year-old Slavovak and the 21-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
Men rejected the blame.
They are facing 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional punishment.
The speaker Peter Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had annulled the decision of the Regional Court and returned the matter to him again.
The reasons that led the judge refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the prosecution, the youths attacked a seven - year - old man in his house.
The senior died of a traumatic death.
According to the prosecution, he was strangled, beaten, and kicked all over the body, as well as a metal object, apparently a gas pistol, and placed about three dozen wounds in his head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures in the skull, swelling of the brain, or bleeding into the brain, which he succumbed to at the site.
The youths reportedly took some 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from their home.
According to the Regional Court, they were the only one, in addition to the indirect evidence against the defendant's smell marks, which the expert assessed as not fully established in the sense of the statutory guidelines.
While the smell marks at the scene and on other matters coincided with the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as substantive and not smelly traces.
Moreover, there were some doubts about dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was not proved without question.
However, the Court found that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he'd fallen and injured himself.
Even an approved rescue doctor did not alert the violent death.
Thus, after a few days, criminals contacted olymotic doctors who found signs of violent death while drinking.
The police could no longer work with all the crime scenes that the relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA on the defendants was found on the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradško.
He is now serving the 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed to him by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who are guilty of a robbery of gold theft.
The loot took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slonom.
The youngest of the accused of the murder of a senior lives in Uherski Hradištej.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November will start the reconstruction of the football stadium in Znojma.
On Thursday, the stadium was picked up by the builders, who will reconstruct the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter will close down for a good week Autumn Strings
The Saxophone Giant and the jazz scene legend Wayne Shorter will make the next midpoint for the 18th edition of the Autumn String Festival.
Shorter will perform on 6 November in the Grand Chamber of Lucerna together with his quartet composed by Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, shorter will be joined by the spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia led by Martin Kumžák.
In Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra, the composition of Pegasus from the novel album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of power, which also proves that the Prague concert in the autumn of autumn will launch his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than 60 years ago.
The number of interpreters he worked with ranged from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitousz and Vienna native Joe Zavinul, whom in legendary Weather Report for more than a decade were taking the direction of a new style of fusion.
For the past 13 years, he's been performing with Wayne Shorter Quartet in particular.
The afterparties after the festival will be the club night Spotlight, which will take place on 9 November at the Roxy/NoD Club.
Next to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana will introduce to the native audience the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with his jazz influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation of Profound Bass inspired dance styles.
The lady said UEFA is not allowed to publish the sentences for the referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairman of the committee of the referees of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, stopped publishing sentences for judges.
It is prohibited by the UEFA rules, as stated in the debate on the Law.
Otherwise, the FACHR would be in danger of adversarial.
Damková also refused to put the Pilsen footballers where they came from in their function.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but other members of the Commission are different, such as from Prague.
So in the event of a vote, I can lose 1:6," said Damková in response to criticism, which was raging after Plzeň had played twice as many penalts as the other league teams.
Thus, although the FACHR has stopped publishing sentences for the referees in recent months, Damková assures that the judges are complaining of their mistakes.
"Trust me that if the commission finds out that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit its delegation to any kind of game," said Damková.
The reason why the penalties are not published is, according to the Lady's prohibition from the European Football Union.
"EUFA prohibits and punishes the disclosure of such information."
"We're very suspicious of us, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have released the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop this, tough sanctions will come," said Damková.
Other countries respect the prohibition.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the disclosure would continue, the Commission said it could lose money from UEFA in the training and development of the referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not complete the program in the custody of the referees," Damková added.
The detention of Barta is connected with Januška and Bem: Are they behind the leak?
The President of Public Affairs Víta Bart was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Along with him, Jan Petržílek, head of the Committee of Analysts and Informatics, was also detained.
The detention is related to the hearings of lobbyist Roman Janouška and former Prime Minister Pavel Bém (ODS).
Information about the interviews with the news server Novinky.cz confirmed to the Czech Press Office a reliable source.
The phone calls heard last March by Janouška and Bém, published by the Youth Front Today, in which both men address each other "Mazanka" and "Colibřík", show Januškov's influence on the steps of the city under Bem's leadership.
The daily said that in 2007 they had been appointed by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they fled to the ABL Security Agency.
That's where Bart owned it.
Server Novinky.cz pointed out that the detained criminal Petržílek worked before he joined the anti-corruption police for BIS.
The anti-corruption service, which subsequently dealt with the hearings, was switched on to Petržílek at the same time as it was published.
"In view of the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský of the City State Department in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the causation.
The case does not wish to comment on either the inspection for the same reason.
Six companies out of ten prepare for the new Civil Code
Six companies out of ten are preparing intensively for the coming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act of 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the representatives questioned said that the issues related to the two key codes in their company were not addressed at all.
This is based on the research by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined 108 Czech companies.
With regard to the approaching date of effectiveness of both key codes, at this very moment, a number of managers are beginning to realize the significant impact they can have on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not revolutionary change will eventually take place due to policy-making.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to move to a new right for their companies without complications," commented partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spačil.
Of 61 per cent of the intensive companies involved in the new codes, 26 per cent said that their companies had already taken all necessary measures to be ready in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of the companies in this number are about to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the contrary, each fifth company has not yet dealt with the redundancies, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent do not have an opinion and the problem cannot be judged.
Only eight percent of the companies admit that the issues related to the re-codifications have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is for the largest number of companies questioned to conclude new contracts (21 per cent), followed by business conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the real estate cadastral and liability for damage (ten per cent).
One of the most important innovations of the whole readjustment will take place in the Treaties, which is the unification of the amendment of contracts only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in both the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which contractual law should become more transparent for citizens and businessmen.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new arrangement will offer many new news with the emphasis on greater freedom of organization of relations," lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukaš Poddáný pointed out.
With regard to the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing statutory liability.
The following are the topics related to the changes in the convening and the course of the general meeting (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legislation means tightening up obligations and possible consequences for the statutory authorities, particularly in situations where companies are threatened or are caught up in bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if members of the board and directors of companies do not deal with the care of the proper manager and do not reverse the threatening decline of the company, they may lose out on the benefit obtained for the performance of the function in the last two years," he added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop the Cartier style as a living language
It is my job to preserve the tradition and at the same time to lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a debauched relic, explaining in an interview for the HN its position Pierre Rainero, the style director of Cartier.
This French luxury house was established in 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team will treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not too many doctors in West Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates for the CNN Heroes Award 2013.
In the competition for CNN Hrdin in 2013, you can vote for him or any of the ten main candidates.
The winner will get $250,000 so he can continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and goes to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde in 1981.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain, and there he created a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle says.
We'd have to take him off Cameroon if we had the money to do it.
Instead, Bwell spent years transporting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwell says.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients in there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon per 5,000 inhabitants.
For comparison only, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonians were able to visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the health care expenditure in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
They cannot enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 operations for free last year.
He himself became a medical practitioner at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME, whose weekend members visit rural areas where they provide medical care free of charge.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped their volunteer group.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people push into the van, fasten on rooftops of medical care, and travel through rough terrain to the villages that need help.
Not always accompanied by happiness.
Once in a while, vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be greeted as real heroes: the feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with its wide smile and untapped energy – is very willing to engage in local joy.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every expedition," says Bwelle.
They come to the village 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each weekend, doctors provide various medical care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other can get glasses or gifted glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that requires school, but which many devout families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team is doing a simple surgery under local narcosis.
Operations are usually performed in the building of the school, at the town hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to relax instead of another patient.
With the help of light from the generator, the operating room and Bwelle hygienic equipment, and his volunteers work within the early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not lose motivation.
"To stay awake and continue at work, they play drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired, but proud of their job.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year and realises that their assistance can be significant for the locals.
One man said that after the hernia surgery, he would be able to work again.
"This will change the future for our family," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second job finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
"I'm not sure when he's actually sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studies medicine for the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia and works as a volunteer for the Bwelle group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so that he can do these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing services such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We thoroughly washed Dr. Bwell's hands and removed blood stains or held his instruments," says O'Malley.
You'll never live like a second-year medical student in America.
Students will usually pay for their journey to Cameroon by themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But as soon as they arrive at Yaounde, their food, transportation and study are provided by Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the inhabitants of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, a constant blow is not a burden.
To help others live happier, to fulfill the promise that he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," Bwell says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain – that's why I do it.

Minister Holcát renewed the function of Main Sisters for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that these functions be clearly defined and formalized to have nurses of their own representatives within the structure of the Office - representatives to whom they can always turn," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of my sisters, and I think that the field of nursing deserves due attention from the Ministry.
This profession requires not only high professionalism but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I'm going to try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses with all the responsibility."
"We have excellent and skilled sisters in our health, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who, by their access to patients, do not help us to perform their calls with all empathy and help us to improve the picture of sisters in public," says Alena Šmídová.
On the occasion of her introduction to the office, the new appointed Head of the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated that she would like to address the various aspects of the occupational position of the nurse and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I certainly don't want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing side by side, each with its own competences and together with other health professionals is an integrated work team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I meet with a number of problems that arise in my sister's career, these difficulties I perceive and intend to share in their solutions."
These include, for example, the provision of simplified medical and healthcare documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative activities of the sisters are unnecessary and are taking away time that they can and should devote more time to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas to be addressed include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve team collaboration and managing health service providers, adapting competences and also working law issues such as respecting the labour code or not overburdening their sisters with a lack of time and place.
We often hear anonymous loopholes, which, however, are not documented on a specific case where violations of rules could occur.
"Where the applicant is not a judge, he is not even a judge, so the functions of the main sister of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of anonymity of such a complaint and allow a specific case to be examined by the competent authorities," concluded Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the College of Health Care in the Department of Health (graduated in 1978) and from the Faculty of Philosophical Sciences of Charles University in Prague in the Curriculum of Curriculum - Education (published in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been the head of the Department of Care and other non-medical professions and the recognition of qualifications for the Ministry of Education and Science.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse in an internal ward bed and continued to serve as a teacher at the High School of Health, where she was also an 8-year statutory assistant director.
From 2004 to 2009, she served as the main sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published a number of professional textbooks for nursing and articles in professional journals, devoted herself to lectures in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
So I don't bow down to hate.
After 12 years, writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) issues a new novel Wind, darkness, presence.
That it will not be a cramped union, suggests the number of pages comparable to its most famous work of Houstina (Peter, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another prominent Czech writer was interviewed by Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't swear hate.
Seeing myself around all the new and new clones of human depravity, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I don't talk about us elders, faces ruined by powerless suspense, vixlaic souls, and the opposite overfishing of ideologists who try to sell their "product" with the expression of small sales whores.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a little digital camera and recorded my juridical friends, weirdos, and hidden creatures.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brains burning out of life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks, and then I read books at the lamppost tonight.
You're talking about feelings of loss, hate.
Was there a fracture in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old, like all of us?
The break came a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, I lived after that.
There's a quiet boy still in there somewhere.
I see other loners, everyone in their anxiety tornado.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm taking part in this huge, thousands of years of life system movement on this planet, the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when the attempt-omyl creates another and more generations of beings, which in trillions of interactions in seconds creates some superhuman, artistic intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start completely from scratch?
Self - speaking, or better spoken, dialogue that leads to the right and left half of the brain, sometimes flows to the level and forms into the book.
Like the period of peace is covered by the quiet sleeping metastases of wars that may awaken one day - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the lava of my life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day I'll be quiet.
It is a set of questions that the brain has formulated and places on them layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness".
Neocortex, the grey crust of the brain, asks the older evolutionary services, goes to the ancient circles of the brain tree.
He speaks to horny beasts, he asks snakes, he seeks answers in a bird's flight, he lifts his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, moral law in me and the starry sky over me.
Eventually, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to an ego metaphorically - would you be able to define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of compounds and electrochemical relationships all the memories, experiences and experiences that man has experienced.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branched with information trees, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to a constantly variable presence, in an unsettling effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode an important message.
Sometimes there'll be overload disorders.
Analogically - as if your "fall" PC, from a speech emulator program and translators from foreign languages would be confused first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after several failed restarts ended in the dark greening screen Biosu, in the basic system that manages functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For someone who hasn't understood what they're talking about, I'm talking about a psychospirital crisis.
You often mention her - why do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
There is a gap in functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior.
Here's a good quote to Nietzsche: "He's been looking into the abyss for so long, when the abyss has looked into him."
A different feeling - that a person is lost if all hopes disappear, psychologically "dies" and enters a new quality.
And why do I care about this personally?
I'll answer with a resemblance.
Once one fell into the darkness and was drowning, running days, months and years, he was still drowning and reading, and the books taught him how to swim - so to live.
He became a diver.
Perhaps a written sentence will help me, as the words of Grabal once helped me.
To what extent do you think of a reader, a particular person who will read your text?
The one who can't be said of anything meaningful, some of them call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best described by Arthur Rimbaud in a friend's letter:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word formulation and sentence formulation."
Ever since he was young, he has read books of old Czech tales, sailed in Captain Nem's submarine, ran through the Walls in dark alleys.
In the end, after all the words of the authors and their message, it is "the sun is bright in the worlds of other Karl Hynka Máchy".
And when there's a book out there?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
The reverse reflection that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, for years after that, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life choices.
Books are actually "lifes" or better spoken "worlds."
They are encoded in characters, they carry experience, the history of regions of which language.
Whenever we wake them up to life, we let their sentences flow into their brain.
It's actually, in its own way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is placed in the enchantment - according to old demonological books we are allowed to be witchcraft.
After the publication of the book, you - how it is - are waiting for an author's reading chain.
I remember you used to like to read.
Are you happy again, or do you feel differently after years?
I'd rather just talk today.
And what did I find out?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic sign - they're inconsequential, they don't give too much attention to themselves, they're friendly, you don't feel lonely with them.
I'm going to give an example - in the town of Red Turtle, there was (and I hope he's still alive) a curly little bookie (called conveniently June), a cheerful friend and a good girl bull.
During one drink he introduced me to the individual articles of the series of readers of my book of Houst.
I looked into their eyes, and then I was shown a crushed, read-out copy of my book.
In despair, I put off the broken liver and briefly cried in a male voice.
We've all stood there, snooping around, and the drunks have been tearing down.
Then the young blond blender couldn't stand it, and with a roar he jumped his head from the window to the snowy curtain.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into the nightland and flocks with the happy rabies of the sensitive, the sick souls of the landscapers and the pathways of the fallen patriots - howled and sneezed like werewolves until morning.
Each book of yours is formally and in substance different from the previous one.
Is that also true of the text Wind, the dark, the present?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin inserts the words of an old Russian myth to the human healer in his novel Suchodol: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog lying there, a gray box on it.
Horrible, terrible, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it somewhere.
Maybe we've been devils in hell a long time ago and we've been losing - what role on this country we're going to play.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Brezina.
Writing is an amazing way of dialogue.
Something huge and indefinable, similar movement of continents on the planet affects our desire from such depths and in such a wide way that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so with absolute certainty we do precisely in the intents of our programmed task.
We are rewarded with the influx of dopamine, endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes there'll be a disorder, and we'll express compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves humans.
That's the answer to your question - a biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the ocean's coast unconscious, and in a dreary sail made of a dirty pocket catches the tides of a damp wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama withdraws from health care
After a wave of criticism President Obama resigned yesterday from his frequently repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can keep it."
With the withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of notices of statements from Republican providers in recent days, the president was accused of lying to the American public.
Yesterday Obama lost his original promise.
"The great majority of people with functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called a "media riot" about statements, Obama called on the Americans who received the announcement to search for new market insurance.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You will get a better offer," he said.
Its administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the scheme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on Access to Care.
"I'm telling these Americans equally: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in her statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who has been watching the implementation of the Act on Access to Care, said that the launch of the internet market has been a "favourous" since October.
"I am disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
The irritated Sebelius voiced this sentence, which was captured by the mic on, yesterday addressed to the adviser sitting behind her at the Committee's meeting yesterday, which took place following a violent exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri who was concerned with whether she herself had to be involved in Obama's care programme.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly touched on why “architekt” the Law on Access to Care voluntarily did not give up sponsored insurance by the government, and did not buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which now compels millions of Americans.
What billionaire will you be calling next year?
Kellner, owner of PPF group, wants to buy O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from agencies and backstages, they say the hand is already in hand.
The transaction notification should come in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for LTE networks, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns a KKCG group.
It was launched under the brand Sazka Telecommunications to auction frequencies for the LTE network.
And to a general surprise, until then, there was no talk of the company's taste in telecommunications.
But Sazku is now leading a very experienced telecommunications pet Robert Cháwatal.
He began as a marketing chief of Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), later became director of the Slovak T-Mobil and last managed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The sled is playing a couple of cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she's confessing she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
That would probably not have liked Vodafone under normal circumstances, but according to the Economic Journals, this could be part of much better cooperation by both companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from the agreement of competing O2 and T-Mobile operators who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in a tender on the LTE network (as a newbie may irritate a specially defined spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to go into the auction at all, it will not be likely that it will only bother to extract a limited spectrum (not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share a network with Sakou.
Vodafone will release the Sazko into its 2G/3G network (a respitely newly built LTE network at the 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In between, the bag begins to build a freight network of LTE, which Vodafone will be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then Vodafone could spend money on a solid Internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech) immediately obtained a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mollusk waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would have won Kellner already for O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobil.
Both companies have already declared that networks will share.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts the state budget enjoys.
And since next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobil, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will the Czech TV ever go around without signing?
President Zeman has entered the era with a legendary scene with a ashtray, and it is not difficult to listen to complaints that gathers evidence of the harassment of the castle type.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík has not been documented in this way, let alone to sign it.
True, the editors took the lead.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such a preference of some journalists is taken from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order or, in order not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of unplaced empathy.
And since we already assume that there is a general bias, we cannot forgive ourselves the question of whether other, though unscrupulous, power interests have not yet been given the opportunity to change the TV's relationships.
The truth is, those who say that there are no attempts in advanced countries to engage politicians in broadcasts.
The truth is, however, that it does not mean that there are no complaints about public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize what they consider to be the trend they own, which is the product of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilisation stage yet, and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists go on more comfortably than more complicated descriptions of the indiscreet situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings affects them.
JAN JANDOUREK: Curse of this country: Presidents on the outskirts of the forces
It is almost a rule that in the key moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfil his public duties.
If T. Masarik were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to the end of his presidential period and events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We would probably not win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight for its legitimacy in the workplace.
And most of all, the nation wouldn't have a hangover today.
Benesh was not a statesman, and he was still in condition for Munich, but during the war he had already begun to leave the hill, and in February 48 he was preserved according to this.
Being a little bit better, he could have gone third in exile and undermined the legitimacy of the communists and their pubs.
It's too bad to talk about Hach.
They elected him with the fact that "Mr. President is not going to make a decision."
But he had to, even though the big decision-making with the knife on his neck at Hitler's office wasn't.
Head of Intelligence František Moravec said in March 1939 that everything should be done to ensure that the occupation he knew about on the day did not run so smoothly to the Germans and with such a profit.
The Senate President and the cowardly government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human wreck of Gottwald had his summer associates executed, as Moscow ordered him to do.
Ludvík Svoboda has definitely been disabled by the share of normalization and has already had to sit down, completely senile.
That Husak was a powerless and sick depressed old man in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only thing.
Havel's lucky he hasn't been seen in the office in years, he's been spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his ways make it clear that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Now, here's this.
The head of state and the commander of the armed forces looks like they're looking, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, now there is no threat to the external threat of the Republic.
Or maybe it's threatening, just not seeing it that way.
Then the question is whether it is especially not (from a historical point of view) good that the President is not at all strong.
It's not normal.
Couldn't we have elected a president in this country once again to be an acceptable and acceptable person?
Remote planets, black and white movies or a little fantasy about alien life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw on the ice.
In the concept of his quartet, which will complete this year's festival of Struna Autumn on November 6th in the large hall of Prague Lucerny, all related to everything.
The partisan quartet of jazz saxonist Wayne Shorter are the current feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they've just experienced.
They treat music as completely improvised chamber matters and think about not harmony or rhythm, but in film paintings.
However, this principle is freshly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, nine-grammy wearer, Miles Davis' former co-player, and today perhaps the largest living jazz saxophone player - is not happy to explain.
He doesn't talk too much about music, even though his overall view of life and music is closely related.
In my 80 ’ s, I came to the conclusion that it is best to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything, and then they're disappointed when things turn out different," Shorter says.
How insects from Thailand raised the market for the Paris bar
Maybe you're scolding on the insect, and you have no idea that you're going to eat it at least a half a kilogram a year.
For example, lightened in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trends: it is ecological, nutritious and you also have a unique experience taken care of.
He placed the insect offer as the first in Paris on his company's menu at the beginning of October Elia Daviron, cook and owner of Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar for whose name was William Burroughs' inspirational book Naked Lunch would be located in a fashionable 18th district near Montmartre by a well visited tourist.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger and shingle eggs, the guests can freshly bite not only the different larvae, locusts or water bugs, but also the rats can be tasted.
Carefully and specifically wrapped supplies (so that the insect does not damage the wings, twist the legs or cause no damage to the eyes) send Daviron all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it is common elsewhere.
The owner of the Paris bar with the pioneer menu gives just a few reasons why to consume insects.
The first is an ecological benefit because the production of insects is much less expensive for our planet (financial, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron said to the Reuters station.
At the same time, a young cook does not deny his profession, simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, it makes the right restaurant a pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would probably be excited by the idea of eating a bug decorated with a pest, but the reaction of customers of the Paris bar to a served insect is very positive according to the owner.
Even skeptics say they eventually taste, even though they start with the least bit of remorse and eventually choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the State has not yet dealt with the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in the various regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measures, will contribute substantial amounts to heating, but also to the chances for construction companies and builders.
Every billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
In terms of fiscal policy, the state has significant leverage and multiplier effects, and it is also one of the most important growth measures.
Therefore, the association of construction entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic is fundamentally opposed to the government's resolution and requests that steps be taken to allow for further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be announced within its framework.
AMENDMENT, 1 November 2013
The dog sums up the carpet, the president shuts down and ends up with crutches.
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on a bed, and left for the castle in Lánj.
What's her condition?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage “has gone too far. ”
John Kerry indicated the amazement of the U.S. defensive stance on his surveillance programmes and in an unprecedented confession said that in some cases spying “has gone too far.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for the fact that, in view of the angry revelations about NSA spying activities, which appeared thanks to informant Edward Snowden, they were acting as an autolito.
Public information has sparked a diplomatic storm between the American government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video link to an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government have actually learned about some things that have been happening since the permanence, because the possibility was, with reference to the Second World War, the difficult period of the Cold War and then of course on 11 September.”
He thus became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage crossed the border, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: "In some cases it has gone too far."
And the President is determined to try to explain it to people and to clarify it, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that abuse has taken place.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA was working for good and that its monitoring operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is firmly committed to killing and throwing people into the air and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happened?
In fact, we prevented the aircraft from falling, the buildings didn't explode, and the people weren't executed, because we can learn about these plans in advance.
The president of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday that the American legislators were going to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad concerning alleged American espionage and convinced Europeans that it was necessary to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others and that he was concerned about their threats, that he would stop participating in counter-terrorism organisations because they are disappointed by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the US's national and security interests, it is really important that Europe stay with us on one ship, given the joint effort to combat terrorism, said in an interview with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the President of the Senate's Sub-Committee on Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their rage over NSA programmes.
The news in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe has disrupted relations with some American allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another revelation quoted Snowden documents as saying that the NSA had been monitoring the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and up to 34 world leaders.
The head of the National Intelligence, James Clapper, defended allied espionage as necessary and said it was a common matter on both sides.
In the middle of the gulf Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary path that should take place this year, and hopes that members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators intending to be involved are to be published.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the road is to help improve relationships, he added that they would be prepared even "a well-considered educational measure".
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people about spying programs that they use for years.
"Because we are editing our surveillance programs to better protect Europeans' rights, they must also realize that we are not the only ones doing spying here," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr Kerry is on schedule this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to respond to the instability that has sparked the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US follow-up.
The Australian woman appealed against staying in Thai prison.
A 20 - year - old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island, who falsely claimed that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
On 15 June, Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged by the Earth Court on Phuket Island with false charges when the Thai police said that a taxi driver and two other men who allegedly detained her were attacked on Sunday morning.
However, the surveillance footage from the industrial television later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she realized she had made up an event.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security correctional facility in Phuket, instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
He is the daughter of a former Australian league player, Peter Tunks, who asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra in his case.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is obviously a difficult time, but we hope to return to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail for 50,000 baht.
In the meantime, Australia reports that she spent her vacation in the recreation area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
According to law in Thailand, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to proceedings that would increase her sentence and result in imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian staff member Michelle Smith’s travel agency in Phuket, Thailand can also try to fix a graved image for tourists, which may have been behind a liberating verdict.
The Jag joked, the goal of a brother?
There was a knock in the defense zone, and no one caught him again.
In addition, the leak changed after a quick forhand click.
Jaromír Jagr scored this way against Tampa on Wednesday night, then on Thursday night, the 119th winning goal in the NHL commented on the Facebook social network.
"After watching this video, my agent Peter Svobod was summoned by the director of the Czech Roads and asked him if I should not be interested in advertising on their most modern Pendolino train!" he wrote in the introduction to the Jagr supersail.
I hear we're kind of like each other a lot.
I guess I'm gonna have to quit night practice so I don't have to rush any more.
"I'm afraid that then the Minister of Defense could call and want to make an ad on the jets!" added the smileys.
New Jersey added a second victory in a row.
"And above all, you have noticed - the treatment of Mary Rottre works," Jag said.
Place of post-election candle pollination gourmet
The October elections rather than the winners brought a bunch of losers.
They are not only parties who have not even reached the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. the JPOZ), but also previous governmental parties (ODS, TOP 09) and, ultimately, the ČSSD because of its internal breakdown.
Politicians have served us on the weekend of the election gourmet instead of the holiday candles.
Andrej Babiš's movement has become a leap of election, which has promised voters to change the political style of government.
The severance of the election result and the break-up on the winning side is recorded by the political (by) will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who were publicly supported by President Zeman or elected to the House of Representatives.
Although the president lost strategic lead to other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he still has a few more ways to get it back - for example, by selecting a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD chances of gaining a prime minister's chair in my eyes go further, businessmen of Andrej Babiš are getting closer.
While the post-election development is miles away from the rapid and smooth establishment of a stable government, compared to the electoral scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by the communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy is only better news.
Due to the loud resistance ANO to join with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL coalition (total of 111 Members).
Given the breakdown in the ČSSD, which has become an insoluble and weak parter in the negotiations this fall, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite challenging for the ČSSD.
The Minorious Government of the ČSSD, composed of "non-Germans" in the Castle, is not likely to pass.
In addition, any government that the ČSSD will participate in will be threatened by the dissatisfactions of many Social Democrats, which may lead to further divisions in the party sooner or later.
So I'm asking myself, "Can't we go to the next early elections on our own?"
Other elections would rather be a referendum on the strength of the electoral mandate of the ANO movement.
The plans of the ČSSD to introduce sector taxes, to increase tax on revenue or to build a state bank have fallen hopefully under the table.
On the contrary, the ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Osvet sides are consistent, for example, with business support, a moderate fiscal policy (a government deficit below 3% of GDP), employment support for disadvantaged persons, lower VAT rates for selected goods.
The three areas are most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
But now it's on top, so the program so far the most likely coalitions ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would be inclined to the right.
Which from my point of view is ultimately a better result than a left-wing tax program for everything that is still moving in the economy.
