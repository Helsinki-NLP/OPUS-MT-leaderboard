The strategy of the Republican side against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy of the necessity of fighting against election fraud.
However, Brennan's Centre calls this a myth that election fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
In the past ten years, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of U.S. election fraud.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. is responsible for the organisation of federal elections by individual states.
And in this spirit, the majority of American governments have been declaring new laws since 2009 that make the election process or registration difficult.
This phenomenon recorded post-elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting electoral law were submitted in 41 Member States only in 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit a photo identification card and a US citizenship document.
In addition, these laws restrict the period for elections in advance, invalidate the right to enroll in the electoral list on the day on which the elections are held and remove the right to vote for citizens with registration in the criminal register.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no American state required the presentation of a photo identity by voters.
The first country to introduce this request was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law confirmed in 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other States as well.
In the past two years, such laws have been supported in 34 states to force voters to submit photo identification cards.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, 21 million people aged to vote, do not own any photo identification issued by the government of their state.
Furthermore, there is no such identification of about five million new voters in 2012.
The acquisition of the required identity card often costs more than $100.
New restrictions are disproportionately affecting young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income below $35,000; 18% of citizens 65 years of age and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years of age therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters by their preference for democratic candidates are not authorised in several States to use their photo identification issued by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs, who elect Republican candidates rather, to use cards issued by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state had required a record of citizenship for the elections.
Arizona introduced the first such request.
Since 2011, about 12 states have passed laws that require voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim at limiting the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is necessary to note that two of the three Hispanics prefer the democratic side.
Republican legislators supported laws in the eight states in 2011 which disrupted voter voter registration on the day of the elections.
Moreover, they have restricted the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
During the 2004 general elections, for example, the voter registration campaign helped to register about 10 million people.
The measures adopted after 2009 however led to a fall in the recording of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican legislators then adopted laws in the other five states aimed at shortening the election period ahead.
For example, during the general elections in 2008 in Florida, the African-Americans made up 33% of the voters who voted ahead, even though African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They formed only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted ahead.
On the other hand, the whites, representing 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted ahead.
Against the approval of laws restricting voter registration, democratic legislators and their supporters have, of course, become very strong.
Democratic governors blocked several laws with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General has even intervened.
In part, they managed to reduce the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries accepted laws requiring the submission of a photo identification card.
However, the new rules introduced will inevitably make the exercise of voting rights more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics speak mainly of the biases of approved laws and consider them a clear attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states where these laws were approved represent 171 of the 270 votes in the polls required to win the presidential election.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: complete examination or not?
The PSA test has sometimes produced wrong results, which were wrongly negative or even wrongly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this has increased the weight of men who have been so reluctant to go to the exam at all.
Let's get tested or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there has been a high level of contamination between individual groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a difference in mortality between patients undergoing examination and those who did not.
This study has also shown at 12 years of age that those who fail to examine have 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
So I recommend a test from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also the most endangered group.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is exposed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and types that are not liquid.
It is therefore necessary to explain correctly to the patient the degree of hazard of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treating prostate cancer that has no impact on life in the long term, and to focus on active disease surveillance in these cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
Rather, we will offer them active supervision and we will offer treatment in the event of disease progression.
More often and more accurately, we set the criteria that help in deciding which kind to treat and which not to treat.
However, I recommend that the examination be completed.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate for and against the investigation of PSA.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, it seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease by adopting principles of healthy lifestyles.
It is estimated that if everyone ate and moved healthy enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer is caused by inheritance.
Also, some percentage remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even though the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It's extremely harmful to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers still in Quebek today," André Beaulieu, speaking speaker, shakes his head.
Encouragement: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of death to cancer decreases by half.
Weight
Pulse and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and limb cancer, eczema, saliva and uterus.
"Research suggests that regular body activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrition
The organisation also recommends that red meat consumption be reduced.
With too high consumption, the risk of colorectal cancer may increase.
It is appropriate to avoid the veins for which the same applies.
Conservation of meat by the stinging, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet drawn clear conclusions.
Vitamin E studies are controversial according to the SCC.
Although one study found that there was a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, other studies referred to its increase.
Neither the effect of vitamin D on cancer is clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu further insists on how important it is to talk about his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"Researching doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs boson examined.
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate disturbance last summer.
There is the view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And it is also the last particle whose existence predicts the standard model - our best or "not least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - which, however, has not yet been observed empirically.
However, there is not yet a 100% certainty among physics that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
New data published this week during a major physical congress in Kyoto are more likely to confirm it, but all data are missing so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, suppose this is a Higgs boson, because the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see what it actually is.
In this world there is a completely unquestionable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be bypassed - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that even with it there is a similar law: Pauli's exclusion principle that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same moment, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "stand" roughly creates some of their properties.
It also divides the physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find well-ordered citizens, or fermions, who respect Pauli’s principle.
And at the second end, the bosses, the vile anarchists, who don't appreciate anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can still be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley's labs: the meats that we leave here without notice, and the "power particles" that spread great natural forces and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic as they might be thought.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: photon, or "participation light", which is the "transmitter" of electromagnetic power.
Because when particles with an electric charge accelerate or change their direction, they "offer" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "excession" produces electromagnetic waves (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than photon - and thus one of the bosons, "power bearers".
A more stable field
Also, it's with the Higgs boson, only with the difference that "disrupting" is a different field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for its expansion it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, just like at the frozen pond level, it will destroy only a very large balvan.
For this reason it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator of the component as CERN - a large hysterical accelerator with an accelerant bundles is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
Electromagnetic field analogies are useful again to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Electromagnetic fields do not respond to all the particles or all the materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be held by itself on a refrigerator.
And it is equally true that the Higgs field does not respond to all the particles: those who do so have a certain mass, while others (such as photon, look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks what all this research is for, what "will it bring us"?
In terms of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any mismatch between observation and SM forecasts.
In addition, there were no physicists literally wanting to find them, because the slightest difference could open the space "new physics" and heal some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge shortcomings, does not provide any explanation of gravity (feel!) or dark matter, which accounts for about 80% of the space mass (single!).
However, CERN has not yet revealed such a contradiction.
Responses
The responses of these studies in the daily life of Mr and Mrs Novák can only be predicted very difficult, but the mistake would be to believe that there will be no one.
Look: at the beginning of the 60s alone, the pioneers of the laser in Bell's labs had no idea of the revolution that their work was causing.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicsik Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first constant laser beam (the previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I already said - the laser was initially considered such a "laborary player".
Just imagine...
In addition, application may also result from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical work.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan at first at all, now serves as an "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and awarded him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that LHC-related activities need to change our lives, but that means that you never really know...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life...
Through his Dignified Death Commission, Quebek recently engaged in sensitive issues concerning the end of life.
The debate should continue shortly and the draft law is being drafted at the same time.
Much work remains to be done in this crucial area.
The newspaper Le Devair tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérie.
Prostate cancer, which fed him, gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's already seven," he says without emotion on his bed in the house for the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he came the day before.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," it adds.
The disease has done its work: an immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the bathroom himself or just eat himself.
He looks at a tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop by, bringing him drugs, offering him a bath.
Courage for ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the premium, he humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In all your life, you learn that men are urinating," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person" whether the return will be accepted, says the psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of people who care for palliative care, the essential moments occur in the very core of such a return.
Patients entering the home with the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses taking care of them does not provide them with so-called "medicine" care.
In the case of Mrs A, 89, it is the worst fear to die "to suffocate with full consciousness".
But my illness allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," he says, and then he'll let us put on her breathing machine.
Yet, he is still looking forward to the final visit of his son from Italy in the days to come.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, care for the body with the help of nutrition.
That's the kind of palliative care that comes in unless there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québek, one bed of palliative care belongs to 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all gonna die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, he may be given a sip of a brandy or a peppic, according to taste.
Diabetics may no longer monitor their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night, they brought a beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer to honor his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, day after day, but they don't like each other.
In addition to a 30 - year - old man who enjoys his last encounter with his family, thoroughly grounded in pillows, while they drink to him in his honor, a tragically six - year - old man, surrounded by his parents, a woman and two young children, has tried every way to survive.
"There are always three to five beds for up to 45 years of age for cancer," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who come to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate suffering once the patient reaches the final stage of his life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Treatment Company, specialize more in the care provided to oncological patients.
And this fundamental lack of health care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of the Euthanasia Act and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed in circulation by tops in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they prove their disapproval of such an initiative.
According to Dr Christian Martel, the Quebec medical system is not efficient enough to ensure that all persons have access to quality palliative care before they can agree to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency in massive pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
It is feared that patients should not be put to death for lack of adequate care.
At the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last few moments, regardless of adverse prognosis.
The hope of survival of Hélène Richards was already very minimal when she left demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was stopping fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die are grateful to their doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when their team of palliative cunts eased their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is not necessarily all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the director of palliative care in the Grand Montréal Association, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of their life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that will sleep until the end of their lives, whether administered permanently or permanently.
You can't pretend we don't see this part of suffering.
A patient that we do not relieve of pain will be increasingly able to access palliative sedatives.
Sedative diseases always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to provide me with euthanasia," which means "I want you to relieve me of pain."
The implementation of this report has enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel managers, construction and public workers, lobbyists and experts in the Italian mafia continue to tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which the bowling of construction, civil servants, politicians, experts and mafias.
This "branch" came Cuban taxpayers very dear especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has spread since we took essential measures," says Ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former Chief of Police in Montreal.
This led to a scandal in 2011 based on a consistent investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, approved by the then liberal quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest after long delays.
The "Duchsneau report" confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque financing of parties and corruption of civil servants.
"From the start of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport saved a billion dollars in contracts," when some people kept up their instincts to gain a share on them!
Charboneau's commission "which led to the demise of two mayors," adds with the hope that she will be able to "disclosure the grace of some people".
Standing Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
A permanent anti-corruption unit founded in 2011 is also involved in the fight with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition to this, the Marteau types police officers, who have since 2009 ensured that the montreal "money cartel" significantly mitigated the inflatability of contracts...
In recent weeks, a number of visits have been conducted and several general representatives have been accused of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one village in the suburbs.
Another on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest quebeck city.
He's a suspect that he repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito made a sensation when he explained to the committee the "system" mechanism for obtaining public contracts.
He himself devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he obtained in Montreal to the middle man associated with the mafia, who then transferred the money to Union Montréal, after which the Mayor of Gérald Tremblay nominated.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000 and devoted more than $88,000 (approximately €68 000) to the provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he was organizing illegal financing for former Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money, the prices of which were high
In Montreal there was a "system" of corruption very much.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it before the commission in very detail: within ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money worth a total of $736 000 in exchange for money contracts, for which the price was high.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had paid their fees for overvaluing invoices by 30% to 40% through false multiplicity.
The mayor's organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblaye of keeping his eyes open on the parallel budget, which brought dirty money into his treasury.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, throwing Montréal into an extensive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the District of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island, since 2010 he has been fighting against the sale of common land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters directly in the middle of a flourishing real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
About the investigation that will finally be launched, he says, "he's pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system of the affluent ant to stop the gangrene and attack the culprits".
The process is, according to her, "sick but positive."
We are at the stage of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to set up a own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these dubious practices cannot be returned.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "the public officials have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is concerned in particular about the role of "messengers informed about this flyer", if they have not wet themselves in these buckets!
He estimates that 70% of the campaign funding in Québek comes from dirty money, and with irony he adds, "I heard it was just a weak-minded decoy of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit gifts to $100, but he believes the situation will not resolve: "Until the electoral expenditure is strictly limited, dirty money from politics will disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of the parties: "We can no longer decline; if we are courageous about the essence of things, we can rebuild on stronger foundations and with greater control and compliance with laws."
If this story embodies the image of Quebeku and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to all who ridicule him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you and PSG have set a completely new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone into themselves, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players have come to us.
I get next to them every day.
Technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day these things allow me to raise the level of the game.
And when you fight, it's easier.
Everything goes so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved on to a single degree.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Anzelotti introduced...
The reinforcements from this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that each training is essential.
And so it turns out that a player like me has a greater appetite for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Anzelotti's giving me a lot of credit for my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Macelle, who played in the same post as me.
And the Ancelotti has a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Aneclotti has respect for all techniques.
Today, he is not equal in the 1st league and is among the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win another title in Paris.
I had a calming conversation with him in January.
I've had a series of injuries.
The trust it gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our front position.
But we're stuck in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: we have easily entered the eight-finals.
What's your club's goal in this contest?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for good European teams.
First, we want to win our qualification team in front of Port so we can play in the rematch of the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and enroll in history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial page, PSG has the means to make this plan work.
And would it be a great failure not to win the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
We really want to win a league this year.
We've missed enough last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually, you're the 79-pointer.
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it's going to work this year.
Even though big teams like Marseilles, Lyons or Bordeaux are working for the title, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the PSG media expect too much?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what's been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's true that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something that they're blaming us in the papers, it's not very pleasant.
You ask what else people can want more of you.
Of course, it's not a 4-0 win every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the League of Masters, we've managed to play.
Look at Manchester City, which didn't run into the eight-finals in the second season, and they also invested a lot of money!
In view of the amounts invested, you could expect to have a head start in front of the other 15 points!
You're insulting other clubs and the French league.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which failed too well last season, moved with the new PSG to the next stage.
That shows how awesome the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all the hardships, we have managed to win.
It seems that the PSG rely in everything on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
It's a good thing they say there's a "dependence on Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and that he gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's the star of the 1st League.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect man and player.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly remarkable.
This led others to raise their own level of the game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the world's best defenders, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with a French representation?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injuries, I couldn't play the way I imagined it.
But I've been through it, and I've come out stronger.
I'm doing a great game today.
And I've been hoping for that ever since I joined the team.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our performance exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps in front of the national team?
He's getting results.
We're in a good place in MS qualification.
Coach picks hard, he's close to the players, and he can take a breath for victory.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is 16 October's draw a solid starting match in Spain?
This fight has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never had such a fight in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negative current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs among beneficiaries.
In addition, as is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satosh Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but transferable to dollars, euro...) and a secured BitTorrent-like translation protocol that allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a payment tool.
The bitcoin course first reached a maximum of $30 (EUR 23) in June 2011, five months later it dropped to $2, today it moves to the limit of about ten dollars (the course's overview is shown on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, nothing is impressive.
Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on the virtual finances that came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "concerning the dollar and the euro" and "the period of ordinary money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by being used as "credits" for the process in a video game that a person can get or buy (and sometimes replace it back and forth).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority shall monitor and process individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes are depositaries of current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers as well.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is in fact between two e-mails.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The file of information relating to this transaction is electronically signed by the dual-key encryption system.
This way the network can verify the validity of the transaction.
Due to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in a public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase consists in recording this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, a temporary central banker, will have the right to write down this additional line.
This is the phase of cutting the file; i.e. transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will take over this new transaction and add a number to it, and then they'll split up completely.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (good zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then be displayed irreparably connected to the string of all other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money very quickly (up to ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned because each one has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided on a regular basis by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but they can be divided up to a hundred million, so the margin space is...
The difficulty of the task is also increasing with an increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rises and fall.
The websites that provide services to Bitcoin have been attacked and alienated from stored bitcoins.
"The used scale does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money company using Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls dirty money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Constitution in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins did not escape.
In November, "great discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul on turning bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a callless mobile, but uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily configured for dealers, where new terminals or software are not needed.
Just communicate the address that can be "photographed and recognised by the phone", explains Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchic systems and to move towards more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin enters, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB foresees a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surabi).
NATO and US troops should follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect anything from us.
The greatest harm was suffered by the people in the Afghan countryside who were punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, have lost 88 dead soldiers, and all those injuries and chills.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often they are rurals who reject the presence of foreign armies as they did in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though the jihadists, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbeks, the Tajiks joined them.
Now, tolerances and frequent assistance from local insurgents are being experienced, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I followed from the peaks of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
Truck convoys and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without attacking the air escort helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
From their uninterrupted procedure between 1994 and 1996, conditions changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the land was in the blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their taking over control of the country was then considered to be their kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkening of these villagers, which was fully controlled by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved until our time.
Some Mujahedhdini, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban are struggling to preserve women in a subordinate position.
The main officers of the war against the Soviet forces returned to power in 2001.
They became shoplifters, took hold of state property, sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American contracts for subcontractors.
They've been discredited; most of them have never been in combat.
According to what I heard in the campaign, people yearn for a government that will not be created by thieves.
A number of young people want to leave like those who have managed to make use of American generosity: the loss of capital is significant.
The young are already tired of war and associated ideologies.
During exiles in Iran or Pakistan, the modern world came to know them and their benefits were intrigued.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; in Kabul there are now 5 million inhabitants, five of the population.
Towns are full of state schools, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to provide work, they will no longer want to return to the darkness of former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish TV series that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand in her forehead be considered legitimate?
Some commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that will be outside the control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralisation following the Western model, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so there was a abolition of the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign assistance from 50 years ago.
No industry has recovered, no dam works, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced but fruit and vegetables.
The advantage has a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumours have spread that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And that just made it feel like the Western states were just here to take hold of it.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on the spot and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains, but no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak and left the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore a vast Buddhist area to preserve the role of the most important employer in the whole province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of imports and exports depend, to resume normal relations.
The departure of the French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boys' lycées, French departments at universities, French institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for archaeological delegations.
Since 2009, the initiative "to gain the heart and the soul" has been working for the difficult task of bringing aid and military activities together, in which the service of the "civil-armaded steps" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but has been achieved thanks to the numerous French non-governmental organisation of a number of successes in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural reconstruction in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, involving the number of local workers, helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, wooding, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the cultivation area.
What memory do we leave after two billion euros in military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written applications for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free these farmers from the uprising led by foreign groups, they say they wish to achieve minor civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Hard work in the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi has entered another poker game.
While Egypt remains in its history most divided by the declaration of the Constitution, which temporarily confers unlimited powers on it, it has decided to play a vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, irrespective of the opinion of all others, that the Constitutional Assembly will approve the final text.
Less than a week ago, the Head of State gave this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been using a transparent text that has been supplemented many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal arguments.
This new initiative has further reinforced the country's diversity.
In the view of the opposition, the President finds in his "autocracian delirium", continues "infringing his word" and "snaking the law".
However, his followers ensure that it is a means of overturning the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that makes the brotherhood withdraw from the text of the Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
For the President, it is also a way to achieve national and democratic legitimacy again, while all the countries reject protests.
As he confirmed in the interview for American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it.
Especially because this rapidly organised vote is put on by the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: 'Be approved of my text, or I shall retain unlimited powers', which should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 Members of the said constitutional assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most of the liberals were missing in the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was announced, they knocked on the door with the fact that they were not able to push their opinions.
Human rights defenders, civil society or religious minorities have emulated their step.
In order to be able to do so, 11 people from a number of substitutes were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution have often been unanimously voted out.
The commentators further insisted that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... prayer hours when some members of the committee held the view that the clocks in the meeting room were not properly adjusted.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains, in the end, consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and provides that "the Sharia principles of law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, were hoping to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for the rest of the Egyptian society.
"Creation," the liberals argue, who see only the Greek problem in it.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They shall focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of Al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular on issues of control of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommierová, this is disturbing, because "persons entitled to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy in this."
The fear of liberals is even more exhilarating the fact that the next university rector should be less moderate than the existing one.
"No specific religious consequence has yet emerged.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text were not oulams, but university staff, many of them studied in French schools," Alexis Bluet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "there may be differences in the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to a religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, no. red.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent the civil judges are in order to be able to express themselves."
Yesterday, the approved text is very critical of the expanded powers conferred on the President of the Republic, in addition to religious sites.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction on the former regime.
Another disputed place: powers conferred on the army.
In line with the wishes of the army representatives, Parliament will not be conducting the verification of the defence budget, but the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, civilist proceedings, as required by the Human Rights Association, will not be prohibited in military courts.
These associations speak in connection with the text they believe to be directed against freedom of thought about their doubts.
The criminal act of blasphemy is preserved and the insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasises Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to perform on television last night, a demonstration is scheduled for this afternoon.
The leaders of the head of the state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, buds of the world and sea from saturated salt solution await Ukrainian tourists
The promised land combines the size of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the inviolability of nature.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worshiping Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God's mercy will come upon all who enter this “bath. ”
And Galileo, instead of Jesus' miracles, turned water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and to the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here will go through the road of pain, or Jesus ’ Crossroad (Latin Via Doloros).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the judgment was held, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God's tomb on the mountain of Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of the anointing, and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian bud of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where according to the Christian legend a tree from which they made the cross for Jesus ’ crucifixion was built.
In Jerusalem, there is also the most sacred place for Jews - Wall of shrubs, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Tradition has shown that people of different religions leave notes with wishes to be fulfilled.
Make a path for the vertical
The collapse of Masada’s fortress remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy who Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those involved in mountain climbing can get to it by their own forces.
The others will take the rope to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country there is a well-known Hermon ski resort in the altitude of 1600-2040 m, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
This ski paradise is transported by tourists from the foothills of the hill by a shuttle bus.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the pagan gods were supposedly at the top of the mountain.
Visit the Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting one, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judean desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Art Museum in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
In its exhibition, impressive and impressive Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figurines of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or tours with souvenirs.
The entrance is free and the gifts are strictly rejected.
The fifth museum - Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built on the monument of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You come in and you'll be in total darkness.
The stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve Your Health
The three main spa centres of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can also bathe in the winter months, because the water temperature does not rise below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees Fahrenheit.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year long.
The Dead Sea is, by the way, the most peculiar sea in the world, located at the lowest mainland point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
Azur water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily maintains on the surface even persons who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Choose here to undergo treatment using saltwater - saltwater, and a drug mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, inflammation of the airway, diabetes to treat your fucking nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them was a famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The mention of this city is found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived together a long and happy life.
Indeed, tourists love touls through narrow alleys named after the sights of the windmill.
They say that if you push yourself against the walls in the street of "your" sign, you'll be well pleased.
In the Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds coming here from all over Israel and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "get" the fortress of crucifixes.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontsky.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, for a word.
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population speaks in this country.
It is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is approximately 3.8 shekel).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem a speed tram rides and in the city of Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper.
Basically, it's an underground rope track.
Traveling to all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can move 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel.
From Friday evening to the sunset on Saturday, he ceases to work in marketplaces, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you will only get a basket of food: except pork, seafood, fish without soups and dishes containing milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef meat, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish mashed hummus, various kinds of sauces, balls made of milled china - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
That's why there's a lot of fed cats out there who gracisely "touch according to their tastes".
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Forerunners love crowded places and tastes to go to every kindness.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance -- $15 a day.
And to borrow a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost on average 30 shekels.
Numbers expressed
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to know the country and to relax.
The promised country was visited from January to October 2012 by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Mighty" will announce it in Moscow: emigrants will save money in language
While MEPs and human rights defenders are still debating the Law on Compulsory Language Tests, frauds have already appeared in the country that sell counterfeit certificates
In Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities, 13 million foreign workers arrive each year.
Most of them are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force requiring each migrant worker to pass a test on the knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyles and retail sales sectors.
FMS promises, however, that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, tests will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Language knowledge will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
This law is not subject to the people who successfully achieved the attestation and obtained the academic diploma until the collapse of the SSSR in 1991.
Benefits, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, University of Friendship among Nations, Moscow State University, State University in St. Petrohrad and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the exams in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia.
Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services) also supported the initiative to support the introduction of testing.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have often asked in the press the question: and what will this really do?
What changes the obligation to know the language of the Russians and the visitors themselves?
So above all, the migration service representatives are responsible - it will make it possible to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "child labor."
Many people are talking today about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the FMS Russian board in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will allow 90% of the problems of foreign workers to be solved.
Problems arise in non-professional migrants without education who do not know the language and have no medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language - he says with Sebelev's conviction - a future migrant is sentenced to encounters with unholy people who, under the pretext of helping him to provide a "show" in the terrible, tight accommodations in which he and tens of others, such as he himself, will spend months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their country they promise one thing, but when they arrive, they will cheat them, confiscate their passports, do not pay the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Head of the Tadjic Administration of Labour Migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't bother!
Less so that many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia to work do not only recognize that they do not know the language of the country they want to get into but do not even have experience with the work in question.
Of course, it is not their fault, as is their misfortune: only very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need decent clothes, shoes, and school furnishings.
As children grow up to be productive, they must work at the first opportunity.
Without language knowledge, it's hard to admit.
"You feel humiliated and undervalued."
True, in view of the Law on Language Tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
The testing will be carried out only in those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even take the exams, they won't get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers are living as illegally as they were in Russia.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry Forbidden"
Many of the coming workers claim that it is not easy to gain official status in our country.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and there are blackmail cases.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," he shared with journalists about his experience with a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Chuskadamov.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy yourself a painting."
On the first day of validity of the Language Act, it was found that fakes were not only proofs of registration of migrants.
FMS staff have already confiscated several false certificates of language examination.
The forged documents are printed on a regular colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get free: each migrant in the hope that it would make it easier for him to pass the tests, paid for this document 7,000 rubles.
That's two and a half times the amount of the official test that's going to cost the migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to secure the system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy evidence, which is consistent with government officials and human rights defenders.
So far, government authorities can promise foreign workers who have failed tests for the first time, the time needed to complete a course of basic Russian language.
For visitors who do not know Russian, work is envisaged in areas where active human behaviour is not required.
MVD (Ministry of Interior) does not take into account the illegal arms market
The share of criminal offences with the use of legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia is proposing a tightening of the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: there have been shootings at weddings that have gone around without sacrifice, and a massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the loss of seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which to obtain a weapons licence - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Jarovaj, who promised that amendments to the weapons law would be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of "strapping bolts".
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - require rejection of the "sensual tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, lawyer and criminalist in talks with the Russian BBC editorial.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed in 2012, using the firearms of the registered authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not force the offender to turn to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon can currently be found at a low cost in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
"Black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranec, who worked ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept arms orders
The first of them - "Armad or a military route", which means a weapon that was removed during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The gun was stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranec.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen from security forces.
Baranec explains that there are also thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of criminal authorities.
Illegal "mainly" are being sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It has been proven that some fires were deliberately set up - to cover up the manka," the former soldier said.
They bring their contribution according to Barance and the manufacturers of weapons.
"There are currently private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market and are cutting off weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow," this expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially large numbers of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in the mammoth, and there is a mafia that organised their gas production," the former soldier explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have estimated the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Public Administration Analysis and Design Centre.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminal literature and data from public data portals focused on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons were found in the black market "to be responsible for officials whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons of armed conflict originated in 14% of the cases, while weapons were stolen in their manufacture, 5% was "black archeology".
A consultant selling one of the arms trades that has asked us not to mention his name is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations of black "archeologists" no longer buy - are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers drive for new shipments directly into military warehouses.
Despite the Ensign, an interestee buys a unit, such as the TT gun.
You order a gun with him and he sells it over the fence.
"He will take her to the city and sell her for 900 euros for a piece with two stacks," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and that's why whenever they start to burn a plan in the clarity of crimes, they're going to do a check-up with traffickers with illegal weapons," he says.
"Like in a luxury store."
Buyers usually find each other through their friends.
I visited the website and blogs until a guy showed up to offer me the opportunity to go to the test platform, where there's gonna be a man who can lead me to the "point" where we're going to act.
The prize was mainly found out there
Military Rapporteur Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, he tells the salesman - a consultant.- I have a friend like him, but I don't trust him fully.
Market vendors are, but there's also a need to go, hypothetically, from Mr. Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to make sure that my daughter fell out of her tooth."
And now I'm going to get through a person I'm sure of.
He's also gonna give them to me because he knows I'm not gonna give it to him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he worked a statue to publish on the subject.
The scheme did not change according to his words.
They gave him a photo album, where it was "all you thought about."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier remembers.
To the buyer, according to Baraněce, do not offer the hare in the bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, I just don't buy - we go with a salesman into the woods and we build a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I see that the gun is shooting well, we're starting to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Toilet on the couch
The search engine will bring you to the website and groups to "Vkontakt", where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are necessary.
"It's enough to have a fixed amount of money," they write in an advertisement on the "Buy a fighting gun or a machine" website.
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course, without a license," the user "Ivan" is asked (the description is retained).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently blew up a huge network of bagged websites, and those wishing to buy a military weapon can scrape with a shovel.
People roll like hungry fish on bait and then get coal on Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military officer Viktor Baranec
I have heard of such schemes:web pages are usually registered beyond the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
Buyers will pay through ATM.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photograph and a description of the instructions where the gun is hidden," reports the press spokesman NGO "Right to Gun" Dmitrij Kislov.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after entering the order on the website you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

100 dollars' worth of Makarov
When you buy illegal firearms, you'll usually pay an amount from $100 to $900, according to experts estimate.
According to Dmitri Kislov, you're going to get the Makarov gun from the NGO's "Right to Gun" for $100 to $300.
You have to wait a month and a half months.
The weapon shall be exploded from warehouses for long-term storage by means of medium-term storage.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to January - October 2011 and made 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of theft and theft, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7.8%.
In the United States, fastfood workers and supermarkets strike
Working on a cashier's "McDonald" will pass up to a quarter of all American teens
In recent days in America, the wave of protests against low-counter nets in Walmart hypermarkets and in popular fast-food chains, such as McDonald, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, has risen.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into wave nine or whether it will soon disappear.
Throughout the event, the unions and a number of left-wing social organisations support this action.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries received by a number of employees in Walmart and in fast food systems, the aim of the protest organisers is to achieve in them the creation of a trade union in their organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically intact by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday", when America was struck by an orgy of cheap sales, captured millions of people and in some cases accompanied by fights.
On this day, some of the employees of Walmart, who work for 2.2 million people around the world, left their workplace and demonstrated with trade unions and left-wing activists of transnational companies whose goods are destined for lower and middle class people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers through hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in his stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage employees in Walmart stores only buy at their jobs.
Availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because only a few pay his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic wheelchairs or hand scanners.
Demonstrators of the "black Friday" demanded an increase in wages and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the company increased sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 per hour, but that doesn't correspond to spending, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 per hour, it will cost $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves wage increases fully to consumers' shoulders, each visit in the shop will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than today.
Advocates of Walmart point out that the protest was held only in nine countries and that the company should not cause virtually any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's sales offices lasted from 8 p.m. to 4 p.m. the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its treasures carried out on the "black Friday" of almost 100 million transactions.
Dan Fogelman's representative said in an interview for the left-focused Huffington Post website that jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all over the "other media sensations" organised by the unions.
"Unoccupied treasury!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not the Walmart business houses (you in that progressive town are not too popular, and therefore are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sick, and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council in New York
Currently, the minimum wage is paid for work in accordance with federal laws and the regulations of the state of New York at $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only slightly, and on average they receive their numbered workers in New York City $8.90 per hour.
No one has a lower salary in this expensive town.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Staff at McDonald will pass almost a quarter of the American teens who work behind a counter after school for part-time and live with their parents.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there too long.
At present, I constantly meet with the staff of McDonald, who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal Forum, a comment that the author notes is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protestors, who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonalda's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and the chefs in the fast food business start to receive at least $15 an hour, which is more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that organisations be set up in the fast food sector.
American laws prohibit the administration from defending the establishment of professional organisations and punishing the activists of the professional movement by bullying and release.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier for them.
However, the introduction of a fast refreshment organisation in enterprises is also complex for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Consent
On this day loud protests were also held in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The event culminated in the noon assembly at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians came forward, especially a member of the city council of Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of servings and then doesn't even pay you sick and pays you properly for your decent work!"
Other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor of Billa de Blasio, who said that "we must work together to support fastfood workers so that they can achieve the fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity that everyone deserves!"
As the New York Times reported, it was the greatest event of its kind in the history of the American fast-food sphere.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, although not all of them were staff of fast refreshments employed by tens of thousands in New York City.
Whether this event becomes a spark that will light the flame of the mass movement, it is not clear yet.
"I can't fool my brain on average"
Among fans of modern technologies of virtual reality is a popular theme of widespread reality; in recent times it means to perceive the world especially through the feeding of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference, Google presented a working model of this novelty and in November it was announced that Microsoft also applied for the relevant patent.
An interview with the leader of an interactive group of 3D technologies at the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim shows that glasses are in the past for scientists of this company.
The cure is a perspective of handling virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in the frame of reference what your research group is up to.
- We deal with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we are trying to shift the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has been stuck in the process of working with pixels on a flat screen, at the very least sometimes touching the screen with its finger.
We want to look 5-10 years in advance and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone there is a very interesting control option using gestures.
- What else will we have in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred interactions to a physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output flow has not yet been specifically accepted.
We're trying to change this, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including design.
We need to put the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the users but also the space around them.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects in a much more suitable form to the real world.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it appreciated?
- Surely it cannot be considered as a whole - a question of privacy arises because we do not always want to inform others in our area about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, in order to control facilities in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not the squirm ones, only those that were so lame, short.
The gesture would not be seen by the camera device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far it's big, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of the wristwatches.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this lemonade can?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what they can or can't do at the moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's mutual bond.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can better detect human reactions.
For example, laser sensors that provide relatively good deep resolution can be very important.
- If you want to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically the present generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on a three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just megapixels, it's like math and depth.
At the moment, all current technologies are insufficient for us - it makes work for algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in axes X and Y, but also Z.
So the speed, the number of images per second is also very important.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows 30 images per second are frankly said a little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes made a touch sensor from our laboratory in Redmond with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects the interaction of a person with a machine.
For me at work, it would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, but I just don't need so much touch, but I need some pictures per second extra.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three "cams", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver of a reflected signal.
And the third camera - it's actually a common visual sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations performed.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with curved camera location and see how it helps to determine a three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present his glasses.
Don't you think, as far as everyday use of extended reality technology through special glasses is concerned with one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "transferable" form of the expansion of reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphones, projection screen and around.
Glasses - it is a very personal device, in which is their strength (private things see only you), and at the same time also weakness - expanded reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Your hands don't feel a thing!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that expanded reality - that is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in interaction between man and machine.
I think that filling the mass insecurities could be an eight-time breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - using the second hand as a certain kind of background for painting.
Excellent way to record compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding materiality to these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located, causes a sense of mass, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on the belly of your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
To think that he feels what he seems to feel at some point when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here there is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to make a person physically located in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through an open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of treadmills (not at all as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain cheating becomes a goal, then work is for many years.
That's what works on virtual reality so attractive for researchers - a lot of things are in the very beginning.
Tempting instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradská avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are in charge, are an avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list, there were already significant figures in the art scene of Petrohrad, whose gains exceed the city's limits, often find recognition in Europe without reaching the universal reputation.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is a stunning artist named Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man who's all dressed up in red, who you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable pubs and at vernaculars.
The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract audience audiences.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petrohradians, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is a prominent man of the petrohrad avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets arouses a smile on the face of citizens, it increases the mood of all.
He recently took the flachinet into his hand and became a petrohrad flachineter because he matured into this complicated role with his whole Bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you going all over town in red and not yellow or, for example, turquoise?
- I chose the red color as a designer for the look and the image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between artist, imagemaker and the public.
Although, generally speaking, everything that is slightly different from gray is aggressive and arouses bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at having a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to a discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsky where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my way is.
At that time, the tide of the old free unofficial artists and the new, free types of artists was beyond my comprehension.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasonics, who brought us to "Pushkinski 10", and the other waves were not.
It appeals to me to the theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except the word.
And it all came together in your art clinic-- it was important for me to find myself in the center of Petérburk culture, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I took a place in Pushkinski 10 and there was a music-art club, a Bohemian club, a home of peterburk's goddesses before the reconstruction.
There were many born:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Snura brought the project "Ucho Van Gogha".
Šur and his friends sang under the overcrowd of light songs, dressed in obsessive tricotes, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg ran many hali-galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, which started his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribobedov - that's the sound of Art Clinic.
That's where our working and permanent guests left.
I'm the hero of the past century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the special price was "People in our city".
In the nomination of "The Artist of the Year" I was appointed, which ended my peak.
In the new days according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the past century.
In recent years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic of the way you recognize them.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits that capture the current and the permeability.
I'm going to have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are out of time.
I used to be social, it's painful and horrible to be like that today.
But in clowns, everything's gone wrong, tragically.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
To save the world, for example, by the way of totalitarian remodeling in the governing order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, they focus on external mechanics, not on an inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him your hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by disguise.
- We saw you recently in the role of a city florist. - Cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should he be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are falling apart.
People used to meet in silences, God loved one, simple other people.
Today, everything's broken down in the microsocial community, and it's very hard for everyone to like today.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to make everybody like me.
Today, you need to think about who you're gonna like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And there's a few thousand viewers coming to the Mikhail Stas!
- Fans come to him, he's involved in a sexual social sphere.
And 300 people will come to the culture, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result, less management, less money, everything is lame.
I've got fans, and the point is, no one's going to fool them, and they're not gonna break what they've been through.
When I was young, I painted pictures that were hanging on the wall with Falk and Laronov on one of the collectors.
I started with paintings that people usually end with.
Today, people are often confused about concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There's no consumer culture, it's from somewhere else.
I'm a man of culture yesterday, and I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money for painting paintings.
And I'm for a culture like that.
Cyril, what's not enough in Petyrburk?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: an activist through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
That is not the case during the time of the proper kings in all of them, the Tsars may not have understood culture too much, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
With us in Petrohrad, we have people who could be experts, but they're stuck somewhere in the corner because there's a need for great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and lead them on the right path.
Today, taste buds.
Same as Erart, but it's different that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should be looking for other museums.
- What do you think peterburk is?
- Petérburk - it's not the capital of culture, there's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And at our peak, art is well-wished.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers today than readers, which is wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious who like to go to shows, concerts.
With us, this layer is only weak.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented for the funds of the St.Peterburk grant
Born in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: How can we keep our family in conditions of no difficulty or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think there's a big choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says highly built scientist of the State Institute of Astronomy, P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius are reached on the surface of Venus.
It's possible to live there only at a high altitude or in Venus' orbit... in space.
Scientists began to solve reproduction questions in the universe with a flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown on the orbital track are nothing different from their earthly relatives.
Then an insect was carried out in orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979 a shrill egg was sent to the universe to check how the embryo develops in a state of difficulty.
We get an absolute normal bird on the exit.
But then there's trouble.
"The problem is that this bird has to find resistance, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says the head laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they can't resist, the birds are chaoticly falling and making brats.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds had completely lost their instincts.
The birds did not respond to the light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died within four days.
"We let birds hatch twice, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them," commented Vladimir Sychev, a chicken experiment failure in space.
The last "miniarcha" with the animals flew on the orbital track 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but only the beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats who were already graving into space.
They basically didn't reveal anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts need to be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on earth, the cosmic rats were born.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instincts when losing a normal environment.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens governs abstract thoughts and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was Téreshkov's.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our tea is gone, and no one on Earth can tell if they can fly into space.
He can have a baby after a flight like this.
"Always no one has answered this question," says the Vachtang Vačenge rocket-space veteran.
In June 1964, more than a year after flying into space, she gave birth to her first female cosmonaut daughter, Valentina Térezkova.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andrian Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second female cosmonaut of Savicka was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
However, the risk remains.
We only have a few cosmonauts that have been born after many years and that have grown healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even during orbital years," says cosmonaut-pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero Russia Valerij Poljakov.
Nevertheless, mankind must inevitably seek new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaborator is the mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, under conditions of zero attraction, astronauts adopt the habits needed to work in open space.
Water imitates the state of troublelessness.
Even for adults, water is a comfortable, but in a strange way, for young children it is a natural element.
The small ovaries seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother’s fruit water and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first redemption, only 2 weeks will pass.
"That's very little to make a baby forget something," says the newborn swim instructor Marina Aksenovová.
In short - if for a newborn child the condition is no more difficult natural, then for women it is more natural inevitable gravity, an attractive force.
In an uncomplicated condition, there is a very rapid contraction of the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvic muscles, the ability of the body to drain the foetus.
This can be left out if muscle activity stimulants work during delivery.
After all, it is possible for birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism will drain the fetus.
"What's next?" says Valerij Polzak's complex questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If earthly attraction does not affect the organism, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn on the orbital track can't be dressed like an adult in a special suit with a burden in which he can train.
He'll simply be rid of what he needs to develop unconditionally.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows for the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person on Earth who will be totally unattended to the environment here," predicts the Head of the Committee for Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in space is just a theoretical question today.
One day, however, the time will come when it will become a reality and when the earthlings will travel in their crafts to a distant planet that will become the home of their offspring born in space.
Chief of the NKÚ: Control of the Swiss system failed with the blame of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation in relation to public procurement, but it is listed in its application.
In the interview for Aktuálno.cz, Vice President Miloslav Kala said.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think is missing from us," commented Kal's current situation.
Similar conclusions also suggest joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter’s approach to the so-called “Swarcsy system” is cited.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneurs with its controls - is it forbidden or permitted?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if it prohibits anything, then neither the Prime Minister can prevent the activities of an office which is required to control and enforce its duties," Kal notes.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the Chamber, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties comparing legislation on public contracts in both countries.
What was that about, specifically?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
In simplest terms, European legislation regulates how public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We put all this together, and although the control is not over yet, we have shown very interesting differences - generally speaking, legislation is perhaps even "more stringent and perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to deal with the application of the law itself.
What does this project really do for you?
Such a common control could help us to put an end to efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits if this does not have such a positive impact.
Economic activity means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but which does not always mean the lowest) price in order to exclude enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal conduct.
But by lowering the contract limit, we do not necessarily have to do so.
Maybe the system gets caught up in so many "papers" that those who want to look for holes in the system are going to draw more easily than if the limit remained higher.
You're talking about domestic problems with translating legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our NSA, or is it set differently?
With regard to the authorities, as well as the NKÚ there operates the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in a similar way as we do, also has a college, only formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities are acting in a similar manner.
The powers are also similar to those of a certain extent, but Germany has a common arrangement, so these accounting courts also have at the level of individual common countries - in which the system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only control the federal money, with us represented by state resources.
The public funds, which are managed by the regions and the municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the corporate accounting courts.
What about the legislation there, so it's easier than ours?
In general, I would hate to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany is described as a pattern, but it cannot be said that it is better in all cases.
Is it necessary, then, to have better controllers?
I'm sure not, but I'm saying again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it should be said that even the countries we consider to be a model face a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a good thing for them to work with our office, would it?
What about the domestic legislation, which meant to your office the amendment of the Public Contracts Act, is already manifesting some of its effects?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet evident in our control actions.
Because we're doing ex-post checks, we need to count with a certain delay.
We are only looking at this so far in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool "the detection of the risks of non-profit", through which we have driven nearly 14,000 public contracts, and we analyzed them - these changes will of course manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the terms of some types of tendering will be adjusted and the like.
So you consider the approval of this law to be more of a benefit, or another burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that it will "close" the rules and will not be able to follow them.
For the functioning of the previous rules, controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is the law worth tightening up in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must rule out those who want to attack and abuse him, and not punish those who allow formal doubt that has no effect on decision-making.
Such a system will create only greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road goes.
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called "swarcsyt" - and what does that mean?
Is the Schwarcs system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be set up somehow, and if it prohibits anything, then neither the Prime Minister can prevent an office that is required to control and enforce its duties.
He can say, "Let's change the law and let it happen," but he can't say we're gonna do it, like nothing.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules as to what is to be formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when an applicant with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think is missing from us.
Roads are rough places, but usually drive-by
In several places of the Czech Republic, roads are cold and snowy.
But most of the time, it's a driveway, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovar Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were skiing this morning, but the places were cold and snowy.
Temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it should be slightly warm during the day.
The snow in the region has settled and in the lowlands lies only a weak layer.
On the ridges of the Krus Mountains, however, there are about 30 centimeters of snow.
The sites were also lower visibility due to the fog, resulting from data from the dispatch of the regional road users.
The R6 expressway and first-class communication are now boundless in the region.
However, alertness is on the spot, for example, on some areas where the surface can be cold and slippery.
All roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are also tolerable.
But in some sections, the remains of frozen snow and snow are still lying on them.
First and foremost in higher positions, increased attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubice and Královéhradecký kraj
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a threat of stasis, in higher locations and mountains there may be a layer of snow on the communications, informing on its website of the Directorate of Roads and Highways.
The motorists warn the driver against the abrasion, it can be formed in particular in the higher locations of the Pardubice region.
The vicinity of Lanškruna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or the High myth, especially on the roads of second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav.
Snow is particularly on roads in Krkonoše and the Orlické Mountains.
The captured snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia, it is now most often clear to the point where it is unscrupulous.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in Pilsen Region are driving away this morning, but places with increased caution and driving need to adapt the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures range between three and nine degrees below the freezing point.
After snowing and subsequent cooling, some communications may be grumpy.
The seats must count with fog as well, but visibility will gradually improve.
It's based on information from the regional roadside dispatch.
The D5 range is almost unlimited, but caution is advised by communication managers between 80 and 131 km.
Most first-class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
In southern Pilsen and Tachyovsk, however, there may be grumpy sections.
Communication of the second and third classes is wet and in this case also alerts to greasy sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent roads in the area of Shumava.
Olomouc Region
With snowdrops on the road they must count today drivers heading for the highest positions of the Olomouc region.
After a chemical rash, she stayed on the Red Sea and on her way to the Videl Cross.
Engineers drove snow into the field at night, snowed about three centimetres in Šumpersk, according to road managers.
In other parts of the region, the carriageways are usually unfettered.
"In Šumpersk lies the remains of the snow in the highest positions.
With snowy porridge in the Červenohorski saddle, drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník," the ČTK dispatcher of the Sumper Road Administration said today.
In the field at night their colleagues also went to Jesenicka, the roads to the highest position are now, according to them, naked and wet after chemical treatment.
On Olomouck, the roads are unlimited, but drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the trolleys remain wet.
Ústický kraj, Liberecký kraj
Just a few hard-to-go slots report road users in northern Bohemia this morning.
In addition to several places with attacked snow or ice-cold, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústeck comes from a police database.
The temperatures are also kept in lower positions below zero, so the ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Central, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operating complications have not yet been reported.
The appearance of glaciers reports road users in particular from around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, at night there were perfect conditions for her - during the day rain and melting snow, at night clear and frosty.
The main moves also report adverse conditions on road I/13 on the Ústecká and Liberec border.
The shutter from Telnice to Kninice forced the bent branches of trees, which bent down to the wagon under the snow.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think of the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other scary messages that we people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we're making fun of it and we're saying that we're the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to take away or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to readers?
It's a national benefit event we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 p.m.
The day before 20 December from 21 hours, 3 concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in Tichomoří, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
At first it was probably my idea, and then we made things up with our artist, Honzo Augusta.
In addition to building up enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to reflect with the public on the state in which this world will be handed over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we also created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang a so-called anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World Canceled".
She's already very popular on YouTube today, and she's also gonna sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and in full conclusion, if we do everything and the end of the world doesn't...
She's played by all the interpreters at all three concerts simultaneously.
All of a sudden, the anthems will also be connected in a unique direct transmission to Czech TV.
The words to this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the video played by Tomáš Hanák, and he also sang Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we are organizing a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and have fun.
What's the profit from concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the Barrierless Training Centre, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civil association Tap in Jedlikov Institute.
The students of the Jedlikek Institute are regularly attended by teachers and are devoted to activities that entertain and interest them.
Single students do not have the means to give themselves up as teachers, so we try to enable them to do so.
Within the framework of the construction of the Jedlikek Institute, a separate building will be established in the future, to which we will move with this project.
There will be several musical groups and interpreters at each concert.
What did you choose them for?
We've been trying to build a program that will address all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, China, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere will perform with Dan Bartou, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Dry.
Learn all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning a similar "bombastic" event in the future?
In May we will be performing for the first time in Prague Spring, so we will certainly be preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we are in the United States, would like to connect it with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimal; you have already performed, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these journeys logically and organizationally?
It's not as terrible as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on an electric trolley, her wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we're pulling a lot of cargo and barrels with tools...
However, so far this has always been done without any problems, both ČSA and British Airways have been perfectly prepared for us, for how many times I've wondered.
Even in Moscow, which we came back from recently, it was no problem.
As a result of your trips abroad, you can compare how different the individual is in barifoldity, public access to handicapped and the like.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than ours, we have seen in Russia that everything is still in the east at the very beginning.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, it is still unusual for a person on an electric trolley to move himself in the center of the city.
They don't even pay for the self-evident, like you're giving the wheelchairs priority in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that are trying to alert people with disabilities.
What, though, do we still have to pursue a more advanced country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind in...
It is important to mention, however, that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that even people with severe handicaps move independently in public, can go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever...
But it's not very common that a lot of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, and the opposite is with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for public or barrier-freeness is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers start to change things for real.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap band is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedlik Institute as a tutor, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing a saxophone, among other things, so I started a music club with a colleague.
Well, in time, as our moderator Ladja Angelovic calls it, it's a little out of hand (Laughter).
But has Popularity only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
True, it helped us when we began to associate with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the band.
We realized that a job that didn't appear to be, basically, didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Was it your intention to make it with the Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in its own way, all the new ones are accepted carefully and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique are very few, but I dare claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of the person who sees us for the first time, of course, is regret, that's natural...
But this regret is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering all the abandoned beings that we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, on the assumption that they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if people can do anything with a handicap, it's not just for them, it's for society as a whole.
Has that success also helped you to be a strict boss, how have many people identified you?
When we want to do good work, we must be uncompromising in many things and demand certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the test twice a week, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time on concert trips, they will quickly leave them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
At present, the band The Tap has twenty members.
How many of these were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, it can't be prevented.
Whoever has will and taste, always has a door open with us.
It will take place the day before the world's expected end, Thursday 2010.12.2012 from 21 hours
He will be held in Prague in Incheba arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava by 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected with the televised singing of the band The Tap Tap "The End of the World Canceled"
The aim of the concert is to gather funds for the equipment of a multi-functional freelance education centre of STUDEO at the Jedlikek Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million.
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years have free ticket entry in the pre-sale Bohemiaticque
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted as a twenty-member of this European Space Agency as the second country of the former Eastern Block (in the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland entered into close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years it participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, Poland's path to space has begun much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were dedicated to the cosmos before World War II; they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I will remind you of lecture by A. Šternfeld in Warsaw’s astronomical observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entering space science.
The young engineer’s thoughts (Nr. 1905) left his listeners cold and after years of Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gaddovski was interested in his work.
Šernfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch award for entry into space in France in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and space science.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous propagandist of cosmonautics and his benefit was appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the turned-off side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925 a railway was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and the details of the project are unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used to deploy the drill or to brake it.
Information about this wood is known only from the time press.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has been involved with missiles.
Research has been provided by the Cell of Armouring Technology in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfkem and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyskiegim.
It is clear from the preserved materials that research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, the German army was interrupted by research.
In 1937, a draft photoelectric assault missile designed by Rohoziński engineer appeared in the expert press and the following year the work of Rocket - torpedo aircraft and rocket launcher by the author Leiv-Krzywoblocký was released.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Temporary Advisory and Scientific Committee) coordinated all the work was dedicated to all military use of rocket technology.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activities ended the war.
Further work on cosmonauts appears after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society.
For the first time, there is a mention of a company in November 1954 edition of the magazine Problems, in which there are four more extensive articles dedicated to astronauts.
One of them, from Prof. M. Subotopics, is designed to create a company that will deal with space science.
At that time, the projects of artificial satellites were under way and space exploration was clear to be a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to enter the International Astronautical Federation (founded 1951) and has become a proper member of PTA in autumn.
In the following year, PTA Prime Minister Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
This function was maintained until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has contributed significantly to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (the Meteorological Missile), which became the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
A rocket with a 8,000-meter range was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, a perfect version of RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 were launched in the Bledov desert flight test of two-degree RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1,4 metres long and its weight was approximately 11.5 kg.
Another developmental type should have been able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had access up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, in 1962, further developments were suspended.
The first RM rockets were followed by a meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as two-degree, its total length was 510 cm and the starting mass was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, there was a space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 litres.
Maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, there was a development of the Meteor-2 missile at the Aeronautic Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is still necessary to mention the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
In 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became a second intersmonaut after Vladimír Remkov.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, stand in permanent conflict between themselves.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, nothing limited to the movement of private capital, together with a relentless financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of work, (feet) there is a price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation where the producer tries to import cheap goods in competition by "substantiating" the price of the competitor in order to reduce the market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means either transferring the production to foreign countries for most entrepreneurs, or buying or disappearing cheaply. This results in high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital does not have any social responsibility, and thus also the responsibility for it's produced unemployment, the social expenditure of the state is growing.
The whole situation strengthens the general reluctance of the business masters to pay taxes and thereby replace the economic and social social damages that he has caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well-known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
Unbiased private capital practices create situations in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into mutual competition in order to reduce the social level of their own population in artificially with a view to attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to the general public regardless of social breakdown.
This is reflected mainly in changes to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force the own population to adopt a price dictatorship of private capital in particular in the area of wages.
However, this is the case with the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, but with the limitation of workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty, along with increasing disparities between the poor and the rich.
In the SRN there have been many years of public expenditure on food for the poor who cannot enjoy their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for people in good employment to receive such wages that they must be paid to an existing minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary servants of the commonwealth.
Indeed, austerity measures in virtually all of the EU's southern states have led to the same situation where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic social collapse in the 19th century, or to live on hungry wages on the edge of society in the hope that private investment capital may come into the country once.
But here's where it's coming from.
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or Africans are still working for a fraction of European wages.
That's what Latin America is all about.
The liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot participate capitalically in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital of Sverje maintains that the State must not intervene by means of management interventions in the economy.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect, in fact, govern politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer, yes.
Evidence is the existence of virtually all-powerful and in all States a ubiquitous lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual benefit provision, legislation where virtually everything is criminal but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is that the state ministries for the lack of funding are tasked with drawing up draft laws to private law firms that are concentrated in connection with industry.
These draft laws are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people as declared by Western-type constitutions, but from financially strong groups prefering their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracies are now rapidly entering the situation, as Appianos describes it in his work of the crisis of the Republic of Rome in the days of Caesar and Pompeia:" The state has long been in complete decomposition and the authorities have been subjected to violence.
For bribes, unlawful gain of favor and by using stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were without any distractions, and the people went to elections with a pre-sold vote" ...character people did not go to the office at all, so one day, as a result of this coup, he was standing for eight months without consuls.". "It really started to talk about the fact that the only drug in a bad situation is self-government and that there is a need to choose an energy man."The Appianos thought of Pompeia, but became the author of Caesar, who changed to permanent democracy in self-control.
Conclusion As in the antiquity, the current company is based on an unbiased preference for its own benefit regardless of the social interest.
Private capital is no longer, of its essence, able to understand and benefit society as a whole.
The result is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadent elite without any effort to reform a deeper picture.
The causality of the onset of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalisation of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state, the failure of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of a further round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that the current elite ignores in the future possible hundreds of thousands of losses in life, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have already witnessed together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from competition, the Czech Government will continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population at both international and intra-European level.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reform, which will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will come out of violence and never can" Sting in the song Fragil whose main verse in the refrain is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" dying Guttel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, a number of reactions have emerged.
Some stand for Israel, argue for its right to self-defence, and Palestinian women fit in with the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the State of Israel, genocide committed on Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who in the recurrent waves of killing the guilty and who the victims are, after all, the people of Israel today, including the self-government, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
This is what I am trying to offer readers a view behind the curtain, a view of who, above all, has been serving for 95 years of ongoing tension (calculated by the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch, we can track down some of that Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals have always been completely autonomously guided by their steps and or whether someone behind their throne has been behind them who has guided their actions towards the intended goal.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and its resulting power could not have occurred in the life of one generation.
There is one among these astronomically rich families who could be considered the head of an octopus (if someone still stands above them I don't know but I don't rule it out) - Rothschields.
It's not a lot to write about.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) had already bought in the 1990s to stop their name from being combined with the highly criminal acts in which they stood and which always meant for them the strengthening of power, the multiplying of wealth or both.
They have the main stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where central bank shares are not led or prepared to war (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq’s attack it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Qaddafi, only four were left, but in the meantime Russia was subordinated to the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank of Rothschield Bank of America, began to issue his own (government understanding) money during the civil war and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began spending his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was murdered 1963, Member of Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for causing a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by the highest, 33rd degree consecrated by Albert Pike.
The first war was designed to remove large monarchy states in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule in particular the UK, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (that's the amount of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and they don't need so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a prerequisite for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method that the group of richest families in line with Rothschieldy works is to provoke the crisis and then offer solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the founding of the FED to avoid recurrence of the crisis as they caused in 1907).
So, after they managed to assassinate the Habsburg successor Ferdinand's R-U throne in Sarajevo to provoke the first world war, they destroyed the Soviets by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, military and economically unfounded, the surrender of Germany (which was not needed for the destruction of the Tsar Russia) and subsequently the fragmentation of Central European power, Austria, was destroyed.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, politicians have allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation by laying huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating the possibility of radicalisation of the impoverished masses, and then they have only given sufficient support to the Germans to signify and easy solutions to offer the leader and to create a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also to play, the function of the fifth column, in the light of the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschield was stimulated by the founding of the Zionist movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital city (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration had already created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, if Hitler had broken out of the chain on which the international bankers had held him at first, or all he had done was hard to estimate, anyhow, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentrates created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the German military reparations for the 2nd World War, the declaration of the State of Israel created an outbreak of the Third War.
If the international bankers succeed in disrupting it, the Jewish nation, like the other, will be the first-line victims of the fight, now together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East in general.
Israel is like a vast laboratory, source of strife and chaos not only within the country but also on an international scale (it will take only a sharp split of people on supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit, and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power began?
Here is where it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are pushing people to choose in elections exclusively their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, international bankers of the loyal, a policy that is doing its utmost to wage war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), is threatening to grow into a global conflict and, given Iran's control over the Hormuz Strait, which travels 20% of all world oil (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller now appear in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their image is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a comfortable handful of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted on the birth of a chip that makes him a completely controlled being.
"And he compels all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hands or on their foreheads so that they cannot buy or sell who is not named on behalf of that beast or numbering of its name.
That is to be understood: who has the mind to count the numbers of the beast.
That number represents a person and it's the number sixty-six."
Argo Film: When it's worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979 he occupied a crowd of protesting Islamic students of the American Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrow of Mohamed Réz Páglav, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive outcome - she could not afford to throw a scarf across the deck because it would thus significantly undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
The release of hostages, however, in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of theocratic regime, was unable to achieve it.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco of an attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats ’ imprisonment was eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations were facilitated by the Algerian government.
Their share at home sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
Debakl in Iran made a significant contribution to Jimmy Carter's loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film directed by Ben Afflek Argo describes one episode of the history that America has brought with it a small victory.
Six employees fled just before the embassy was established.
After difficult peripations, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, and helped with an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film staff, who looked at the location in the country for sci-fi film production.
The combination of genres
A plan designed by an expert on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been classified for a long time, the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of more genres.
On one side of the realistically understood political thriller, at the same time called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a shock - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
In the film there are moods - on the one hand documented sequences from Tehran (in the title sequences are shown iconic pictures of events and the way in which the same situation was shown in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, a light passage from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and a slight encore.
And then the scenes at the CIA headquarters and other institutions of men in clothing discuss the situation at the table, at the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable success in starting his career.
He became a respected director from a ridiculed actor and even his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, following the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck film that doesn't happen in the home director Boston.
The Cit for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics of the older films directed above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Argu, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, when reconstructing actual events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also mediates the emotions of confusion and unpredictableness that arise when history is clearly moved somewhere.
Affleck and his coworkers have a similar effect in the scenes of the fictional (false staff on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the film sense of tense scenes.
Quite successfully working with this little thing, sometimes the reality comes up with something - there's nothing so elegantly going on there (the wall in which the threatening crisis at the Tehran airport reverses the call in America and the chase after the rune is quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga is, however, the dissipation resulting from the need to show too many things in too many places.
Although Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the role of Hollywood collaborators, their characters would deserve more space and are far from the only one in the film.
Affleck's film is kind of losing a dramatic move, it's a picture that can be watched with a mild interest, appreciate the realisation of the retro style evoking the thrillers of the 70s.
It's just hard to break.
As a reminder of one still living story and proof of how exaggerated the notions of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, but it will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The web server www.bankinnipolky.com, which annually announces the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We have seen the latest event in which the EU plans to accept a 40 % quota for women in the management of large European companies," said the Law Organizer of the survey Patrik Nacher.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women has already been made.
So far, women in life insurance prices have been favoured because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place by the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
The EU's controversial regulation should also include mandatory blending of bio-fuels into fuels, which, as a result of damage to nature, also prohibits the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substance, or a directive on the size of the cages, which has caused the eggs to be severely irritable this year.
Critics had previously also faced a real ban on the use of the expression butter or the elimination of classic bulbs from the sale.
High quality bananas are to have 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually challenged by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now faces the threat of a veto over the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also based on the fact that, for example, the highest quality bananas had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and could not show "anonymous curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising the current insatiable national standards which have complicated trade.
The EU standards on fruit and vegetables have already softened over the resistance of some countries, pointing to the fact that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for a win in the poll may also be the EU regulation last year, according to which the sold inflatable balloons must be obliged to warn that children under the age of 8 must not be fucked without adult supervision.
The EU has called for American research, according to which balloons between toys are the leading cause of children's death to be strangled.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age when they are blown into the sweatshirts.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule concerning European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU, in view of the sensitivity of the subject to Greece, cannot use the name Macedonia and must instead speak about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the liberal economists association Laissez Faire, the Bank Taxes Server has nominated for the poll, in addition to some of the above, an EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State should also be absurd.
The EU has established maximum volumes of food stocks which could be located in the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded its fixed volumes in preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with high punishment.
The organizers of the survey also attracted the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea and the idea of granting subsidies at the request for a subsidy.
However, these ideas did not occur in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're dealt with by not having the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain had been born in us, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, he had to become a full warehouse he had to carry out.
The EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros to pay for the Czech Republic's further to the ports.
Finally, the European Commission came out to meet the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy was offered to the municipal Ministry of Local Development, under the leadership of Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), specifically to go to write down an application for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Business regulations are an exception
While the regulation is easy for Member States to face criticism, EU efforts to regulate and improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
For example, experts suggest that drawing EU subsidies on projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration but which have been forced by Member States in the budget negotiations is a more serious problem.
Emotion among the Czech Republic also encourages the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, to fight in Brussels for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products, not always succeeding in this fight.
The Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Rakushans, used the designations of olomouc shapes, but the native rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed by our producers as a native.
The names of rum may only bear products of cane distillate, not sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, the world-famous feta and gorgonzole cheeses, the Marcipane of the German Lübeck or the Parmian hams have already found themselves, for example, carlovar drylands, hilltops, and troboňsk hops.
The EU's trademark can also be proud of the Pardubice feather and the magnesium tube.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura claims.
Senator, how do you think a man is going to run for president?
I don't care about being a senator or a president.
If it worked in our country without a problem, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can't watch the country steal the way the thieves run, the taxes and retirement age have increased.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to figure out a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent alien, I have no choice but to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You've reached the Senate, but you've set off at Hrad.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle, based on the outcome of the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I were to be elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is an instrument for how I can carry out my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate ever.
But the problem is not only that we, as a nation, are selling in the pub and on TV, but that we're going to scratch anyone who wants to try to change.
To do so, the media, who degenerate and confuse the freedom of speech with freedom to lie, will be added.
I may have been claimed to be paying off a journalist or to be a consultant for Jiří Parubek.
Let's go to your visions.
In the battle for the Castle you have gone with the same material and criminal responsibility of politicians and back-to-back confessions over twenty million.
You have to change the law to do that.
As president, you don't have that kind of authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I was a citizen lobbying for the guidebook to be a free trade, it was possible to enforce it.
The problem is politics - if someone comes up with a good proposal on the left or on the right, the approval will be rejected, and citizens will be held back.
As an independent non-strategic, I have much greater potential to get support from all the parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take something that is best for our country, from each side, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be a right-wing or left-wing person?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that I'm more of a left-hander.
It's not important to me at all whether it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important for me to go forward.
I don't care if anyone's left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by KSCM or ODS, and I will also be against the wrong idea.
You're wrong when someone tells you you're popular.
But aren't you proving what you said?
When you create a business plan at the company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer.
Someone can call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they've been talked about by major experts.
But without parliamentary support, you'll only have passwords left.
And you don't have enough in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, for example, you will be able to enforce criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Persuading politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side to enforce it.
If I were elected President, there is no problem with arranging a live television broadcast, where I will ask the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state officials.
And they'd have to tell them why they don't want it.
If a strong personality is to name scarves, it can be pushed to the political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, it was a public pressure.
I mean, I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
In politics I've only just started and for my program I'm going to try to get most support.
I try to move things myself, but if it doesn't work out, in six years, I'll end up going back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've been around a lot of famous people, see if they'd run into the Senate, too.
I went to Radim Jančuro, and he turned down the job.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Jan Lorenc, who was uncovering frauds with light fuel oils.
I've been running for people to be really unhappy, but now I'm on a scale.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and those who went usually chose the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're just two independent people.
People have called the Senate to make the changes difficult.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or heitmans.
Are you considering setting up your own side?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check every potential party's clean past, and I don't have any money for it.
I don't have the money for the presidential campaign. There's only 20,000 on my transparent account.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about the property confessions, what's yours?
Private property is estimated to be about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land of about 25 million, a ten million apartment, another eight million apartment, a collection of art works for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Superb damage for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, he was gallant towards women and at the same time fighting badness and messiness.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million worth of property, and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I owe you that?
I've entered the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program is probably not that interesting.
And I don't have the duty to pay off my own campaign.
The campaign costs will essentially cover what I'm going to get from the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't survive it, for example, if I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'm not running anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing this so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to reduce these activities?
But it doesn't have to do with a salary.
As I promised, I partially silenced my activities.
For example, in the spring, my representative will become the leader of the tour.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much of you as a businessman were used to taking a month?
Two hundred and four hundred thousand, which I take on.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You will find the entire conversation on Saturday's edition of Law.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures are not only played in the head - for example Spikkenisse and recently built Hora books - 2 images
"This building seems fun, it looks futuristic, and finally it's to see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Sure, this house is nice."
But I ask what else we need a library for today.
They all have internet, iPads and electronic books.
None of these old-style libraries are volunteering today, are they?
Spitkenisse, a settlement near Rotterdam without his own job, which is not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
To address this stupid situation, a few years ago, the decision came to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted iron concrete miniatures of fictional bridges, which are displayed on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive, however, was not incontrovertible.
And so the town councillors realized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
The Maas wines from the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of incredibly bold bar graphs and craftsman of funny, often even cynical constructions, accepted a matter of usual peace and at competitive meetings in 2003 appeared with five books under his arms and a smile on his face.
And while the Commission was still looking around and shaking its shoulders, Maas scolded his gifts to himself by their size, and his proactively justified speech ended with the words "Dear City Village!"
So this is my proposal for a book on the Mountain in Spikennis, so called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million mountain was overrun.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and serial houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Hora's books were awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small town gray, which has not yet been able to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall for which you would rather expect a milkshake, is richer for a little contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spikkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Path to the Book
First impression: reading eldorade under the hatch of cheese.
While the elevator rides through the massif of the mountain, the real space and reader's passions can be discovered only in walking over topography.
From all sides, the glass interior is bright and transparent, the floor of a burning bulb and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally stands regals with books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is usually cosy and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and we pushed the reader space out of the inside.
Inside the Hory book is skillfully used: on Wednesday there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and central home technology.
Special delight are black shelves on books that are once wall-covered, one parapet, and another railing of stairs.
Look, the structure and smell are foreign.
Over the unknown building material, the heads are even involved by architects and engineers.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project at Spikenisse, asking the magazine Standard.
So one day we encountered a suitable agricultural waste product in a French agricultural establishment.
It has been used for many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a basis for roots of a millimetre fleece of synthetic matter.
It's cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile will last one, two seasons, and then it's ripe to throw away the volume of waste.
For the library there was a fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - on board four centimeters thick.
By acting on the heat and pressure, the so-called Landbowplastic (KLP) is painted in dark, homogeneous and heavy material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
After 105 stairs, you'll get to the top.
At the end of nearly 500 metres of long travel, you will be rewarded in a literary café not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and figurines in flower bouquets.
They take care of the atmosphere, but especially the proper humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glass areas, a demonstration project concerning ecology," Trouborst says.
It melts and cools with the heat of the earth.
Though the Hora books stand under a glass vault, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden collars, which stand round to the glass facade, serve as a shade and capture a large part of the sun’s radiation.
The air conditioning in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will handle fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial sceptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even refers to as "a long-awaited soul" Spikenisse.
Reason: Every citizen of the city was invited to open a book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
This should first fill the optical gaps in the yet not entirely equipped library, which currently includes 70,000 pieces.
The concept's worked out.
The shelves are completely filled in.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, now every resident has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
This was done by the MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called identity forming in the professional jargon.
Spikenisse wrote history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
That's the starting point for identity.
Shabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting in the decision to adopt Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe, Stephen Saboa is using Berlin to ban on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against a proposal for Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Shabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Germany must now be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll support an American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, of course, being too critical to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it was the establishment of a no-fly zone.
That's where NATO ended up.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear view on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy from a policy that was so-called controlled by the US to a German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They're expected to play an independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they're just living in their place, but they're on their way to "normaler" foreign policy.
Foreign policies they have in France or in Great Britain.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean in German terms?
It shows willingness to engage in national interests as well as attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from the economic interests of other powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First of all, Germany has a large resort in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Gulf.
Therefore, he must be careful not to intimidate the public, but not even elites in Arab countries.
Anyway, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to attribute too much importance to it, it's not exactly a one-sided relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany’s relations with the US been damaged when, in the case of both important decisions, Germany abstained from voting, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States, there is great understanding for the German attitude.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a break as Libya's question.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect.
This signals that it must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the US has made a clear statement to the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal policy.
I think that Obama's government probably has a lot of understanding for Europe's position.
But as a result of the political situation there, this attitude cannot, of course, be public.
I think that differences in opinion are really not as great as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very excited about Netanyahu's policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to comply with its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for Germany if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot therefore be part of a wider line and must instead push things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and will push Europe towards a European position.
This, of course, is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive topic.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or is leadership still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for this country it is, for obvious reasons, still difficult to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, Germany will always play a bigger role in the anti-German moods.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable to the various neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
The U.S. influence in European politics is declining all the time, but the EU is currently not filling out this vacuum. Who else is left here?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Protection Marks" in China: when Puma and Armani are all of a sudden Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
This is followed by a designation which is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, he's been protecting them for as long as they're not prosecuted by the real brand owners.
And even then, it's not clear if they're in law.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brand in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office who specializes in violating protection rights in the Far East.
There's a new case on my desk every week.
Counterfeiters need a few extra letters to register their stamps.
For example, the Gucci brand becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of the Prada they have to register Prada-Kny.
In this way German companies are legally copied, like the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch is opening a serial number with stamp office records in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma. An artificial name that also parasites on the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese masters of the world are in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are several-storey commercial houses where counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different. With the mandate of his mandate, the Chinese companies are opposed to being given an official right from the mark office to use a mark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associate brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
That's what women who hunt rich men are meant to be.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's bad business, we have to deal with it," calls Pattloch.
"The wand breaks down, the exclusive position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the judicial costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in the case of expensive demonstration products.
According to CLSA’s market research data, China is €15 billion in the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market for the year.
However, erasure of doubtful records in the brand register can be difficult to achieve, and it costs something.
The steering can be extended for up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports on cases where the court dismissed the action because the name has become a "market reality" after a long period of time.
When the defendant has bad luck, he has to pay the plagiarism still because he damaged his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
Known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, a company which recently took over the German manufacturer's pump to the Putzmeister concrete blend.
Thus, the Chinese may still use an emblem that resembles the star of Mercedes.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that reminded BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The fashion product manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the other way around the famous crocodile.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO notary admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and space.
But last year, "the process of work returned from the emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed objections procedures dropped by 22 percent.
57,000 cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still, 81,500 complaints are still pending at the office.
Something against it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection were submitted by CTMO, which is almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and that means that China, which has been seated behind it, is keeping a list of new applications all over the world.
This also applies to the number of valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were collected on charges.
This simply means that each registration on average costs 1280 Yuan or 160 Euros.
To begin with, the dispute is worth several times, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved that his illegal production of imitation car parts has been abolished.
However, the counterfeiter ensured Chinese rights to Freudenberg.
We would forget it ourselves, because in Germany the last name cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO notifying office then also rejected the opposition of the Munich company.
In two other instances Freudenberg was able to have rights, but the opponent in the dispute is still fighting today.
You need to be very careful.
The matter is now under discussion at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The driving is extremely expensive and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archive, they even had to review the 100-year-old files to present the evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered in vain "a high six-digit sum in euro" to settle the dispute.
"You see what it means to us," Wentzler says.
They threaten that the danger from the Far East will affect Europe as well.
And that's in case the imatriots get unprotected tags.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to register in Germany the Freudenberg marking for footwear and leather.
This business area has long been abandoned, yet it has been able to reverse the registration.
"We need to be very careful," Wentzler says.
He and Lawyer Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful in trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners should rather "everything that is worth protecting, register in China in any way," Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it could be a lot more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg submits to the mark in the last act of his drama, then he will probably have to counter-pay license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: sucking, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbong Congregation is being tested - and in Swaziland, orphans are happy about their parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that surpasses much more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there's an asshole: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's moccasins looking for and finding a tact on the floor.
One-two-three-four.
Then, slowly, the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - are pressing, mom and fighting each other.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he combines his voices with his vocal cordial gestures.
It is Monday evening. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is testing a new song.
There were 50 singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a researcher in human genetics to a native.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every congregation voice has a different text and, in addition, in a very foreign language - a Zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Helping to Be Helped
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Control Programme, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of that, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV is already over 40 percent positive.
For 180 orphans after parents who died on AIDS, in the village of Estijeni found a company called Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
Seventy of them attend second grade school.
Patronate may be taken over in 15 or 20 euros a month.
He guarantees a child's school uniform and one hot meal a day in Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means in the language of the Zulu "Talk Teller" or "He who magnifies".
There's no one in this room who can speak fluent bantum, just sing.
For almost ten years, the congregation has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language, and sometimes it also brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, there is a village of Esitani in the northeastern Soviet Republic, which depends on the might of the German congregation.
Forty percent is infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some in simple clay or straw huts, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, as they have succumbed to HIV.
In Esitjina it is seen in a small, hundreds of countries across Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
Men's foreskin circumcision, which significantly reduces the risk of half the disease, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry a virus of weakened immunity within them, and there is no such thing as dying in less than 30 years.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint road to Africa in spring 2005. First of all, however, Imbongi members saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but clean up everything: food, clothing, education.
Without completion of their education, they have no chance at all in the poor country.
At first, it was still a private deployment of individuals who, for a few euros a year, allowed a child to go to school and give him one warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the "Voices for Africa" association was established, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and cape (gonorea).
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Munitions and Svrab are part of the parasitarian SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and cape occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch’s constitution is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilids reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, they are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (pulmonary), liquid and human papillomavir.
HIV is relatively limited among heterosexual adults in us, but about 20 percent of newly infected HIV patients are considered to be HIV.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections are significantly more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomavirs often occur among our youth.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Constitution, the number of infected syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 diseases in 2001 to 3,698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than a year before.
What are some of the symptoms that alert you to sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, difficulties in urination, discharge, abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and they are therefore left undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
The dangers of diseases can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
For sexually transmitted diseases can also partially transmit infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, particularly in the case of frequent sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPIs and prevent later consequences.
With patronage, gifts of charity, and, last but not least, the honoraries that the congregation earns by singing all over Germany will gather some money.
"We've already sent around €200,000 to Estije with all of this," says the president of the company Annette Lennertz.
Money from Germany is administered in the village of Zodwa Zadmini, a self-conscious woman who can penetrate.
It also provides for mature children to find shelter, such as some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the language of the Zulu calls it to the old women, they are the support of the village.
Some of them also married 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children were brought to school every day in their uniforms.
Children who no longer have one go to the shelter of Khanyisil, a lonely woman who is paid by the company as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" founded a sewing school, built two henhouses, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had HIV tested.
It's not obvious, even if the disease is so obvious in the whole country, everybody's quiet about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has something to do with sexual activity."
In fact, it's strange in the country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immeasurable lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This approved way of life has also led to the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But also many migrating workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennertz says condoms are on every corner for free, but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected relations."
To at least support cultural exchange, Imbongi travels once every two, three years together in southern Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, fighting, confidence in the future and confidence in the black, many in the southern tip of the black continent know from time to time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the speech of black people - such appreciation brings not only mood and joy, but also tears in many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children who have patronage.
Although it is difficult to find this village on maps, there is more than known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Estienne, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is an air line of 8733 kilometres from here, to the assembling singers at the Bergheimer Straße test room, you can see that the light is shining here as well.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
Soda Messenger found evidence that there was ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice blanket could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The American National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even though it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as is the result of three studies published on Thursday by the specialist magazine "Science".
Soda Messenger found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe up to 20 meters strong.
This water came, according to all the comets, or perhaps also from the asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let us not find ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the head of scientists working on the Messenger probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, undetected Earthmen, participate in exploration of the depths of the universe.
Every now and then, they come out to Earth with pictures, a little window into endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is not according to the new concept definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006 "planet".
This cut from Spitzer's infrared image shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, the most identifiable are pinkishly colored "new-diverses" at the birth hall of stars.
This area where stars are made up - scientists call it "W5" in a romantic way - discovered Spitzer's telescope in Cassiopeia constellation at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This shifting glow of dying stars caught Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The pendulum ring consists of a material that the star threw up during the process of dying.
In the giant fog Trifid, which is 5,400 light years away from Earth, comes from the gas and dust of a new star.
Photo of the galactic "calibre" was taken by Spitzer's telescope NASA.
The Starship of Pleiade, also called "Seven Sisters", is at night seen with a mere eye.
Thanks to the telescope, however, color will be better.
The nebulae of Helix can be seen in this infrared image as a red eye.
It is located in the distance of 700 light-years from the Vodnář constellation.
Its similarity with the earth’s luminaires brought this fog of name to North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the origin of unusual coloring.
This "minimum" between the stars managed to take a full picture of the infrared detector Spitzer telescope.

It may be the remains of Saturn's month, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of Hubble's largest and sharpest images: the vortex galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, according to their color, become actual works of art.
The footage, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows a few thousand light-years of distant Trifid nebula in the Sagittarius constellation.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, a triclane), because the dark strips of dust divide the burning heart of this star bearer into three parts.
In Hadon's constellation, astronomers photographed a prelude to a cosmic collision: in the distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nucleus of two converging galaxies must inevitably come to a collision.
This birth of a star was recorded by Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical abbreviations can call it the nickname South Windmill.
Photographs of Hubble's space telescope show the carving of Iris' nebula in the Cefea constellation.
This 1,400 light-years distant fog consists of powdered grains, which are ten to one hundred times smaller than normal domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It displays a ring from black holes, which is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called the UGC scientists 1810.
This star fog is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The number of stars gives rise to ever-increasing increases.
Also, this star cloud, connected with Rosette's nebula, is still producing new young stars, 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only created shortly after the Big Bang when hydrogen was mostly in the universe.
Our views into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo he used it a year later to observe the stars.
From then on, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been expanding ever since, and the views they mediate have become ever deeper.
The world's largest telescope was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this picture was a diameter of five meters.
In American Arizona, Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows you to view the universe with two mirrors, each with an average of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures on average 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to address costs.
Yet its diameter is about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of cheap design: the telescope is secured with a haquad at the height, thus limiting its movement.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the height.
His peculiarity is the high intensity of the luminous flux.
Despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, it will match the world's largest mirror telescopes.
By means of a radio telescope in Areciba, Puerto Rico, scientists are searching the universe for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" - a search for extraterrestrial intelligence - each computer owner can help to make his computational performance available.
View of the Observatory of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
He's standing here with Vera Large Telescope, and he's honoring his name.
This view with a total of four mirrors can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large view is also planned on the Chilean Observatory of the ESO.
Its main mirror is to be full of 42 meters and consisted of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be calculated first in 2018.
Two Keck's telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the world's largest by 2007.
They offer two mirrors right away, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea observatory, which, in addition, looks into the universe and through Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope, with a mirror diameter of 30 meters, is to be created.
Here you can admire it on the picture.
But the most important impressions from outer space are the mediocre of Hubble's space view.
Since April 24, 1990, remote world images have been available to us.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those who are residents.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been identified since the start of the mission.
The last preparations are documented before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The space telescope James Webba (JWST) will first be launched into space in 2018 on board the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists say there's ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
For this, however, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger orbits this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have confidence.
Drink butter daily and you will live 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will experience Bible age.
There's even a museum of longevity.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people will experience Bible age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Search trails in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call driving a Talyse wild romantic.
Microbus rocking along the road with many corners along thickly overcrowded hills, predatory rivers and simple village tents.
Everything is green and juicy, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
However, this here is the most recent south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysians, which is not very well known, except for speaking perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and experiencing a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is not suitable for the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. The arrival from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours to reach 323 kilometers, because the road is only one current.
The fairy tales for which the land owes oil in the Caspian Sea have not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that Lerik has the power to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the great prize of Eurovision in May - and we will have the oldest festival in the world next year," Fatulaje said.
She's the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a documented life of almost eight dozen Talyšes from the surroundings, which are over a hundred years old. Fatulaje shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
At 136 years of age, he still had a baby.
The controversial star of this museum, however, is the shepherd of the sheep of the Müslümov, who was reportedly 168 years old.
Of course, the birth certificate does not exist.
And given that the oldest man with the documents was 122 years old, Müslüm's age seems extremely doubtful.
" Born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulaje explains.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. 136 years old, he said he still had a daughter.
So, then, did the Müslüms miscalculate at their age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the summer people in Central Asia.
"In fact, many people of high age live in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunz Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "and in Sardinia many very old men live extremely."
However, due to missing backgrounds, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrix is missing.
Each day, a glass of dissolved butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerick are likely to experience Bible years of age.
Currently, there are 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why do so many flying people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysians.
On the contrary, the director of the Museum of Fatuljeva believes that it is in nutrition.
However, the fact that the calorie diet of the Talyses who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, many of which drink the glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, from a bromothological point of view, does not seem just plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cenemirana, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, lives Rubab Mirzaev.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzajev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the whole Caucasian region.
He's sitting on the ground with buttermilk, which he's relentlessly kissing.
Under one roof, eight people live here, including one of Mirzaev’s sons and daughter, both of whom are long ago grandparents.
There's two little kids jumping around.
Tea is prepared for guests in the kitchen, which is served in typical abdominal glasses "armad".
Mirzaev’s white teeth form a perfect row and hide a long, dark blonde copy under the scarf, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo either," says Mirzaev.
The monthly pension to life is enough
She always ate only what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I haven't bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was World War II.
But everything got better when he took over Gejdar Aliyev's "loved father" row.
Propaganda sounds strange from the old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that takes place around the character of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as dictator, does not know the limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then took over his son Ilham.
At least old people in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzajeva receives 230 manats each month (about the same amount in euro). This is for the ratios of volume from which you can make a good living.
And maybe he's right and he's a long-decent son of Mirzaev: "An old man enjoys great seriousness in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, they're loved, they're groomed, and they're happy.
Unless there's no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The term "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The polluted demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep fury.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is strongly discussed.
The Egyptian president didn't save the pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for our success, I am responsible, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole nation, especially the Christian Kopts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and seculars.
All of them, still hopelessly divorcing in a confused opposition, they're afraid.
Fear of the "God's State" of the Nile, issued for the mercy of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he had temporarily limited the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own to "save the revolution".
However, what 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctoral degree at the U.S. University in Southern California, really wants to save, is not clear about this.
Is the judiciary supposed to be out of power?
234 paragraphs, which were approved in the 15-hour night marathon by the Constitutional Assembly with the Islamist majority, are in part a source of concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "practice" mean?
That was and is a matter of interpretation and one can fear that the Islamists of this vague formulation and the associated legal space will use it for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, it illuminates the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
That may not be the case, but it may mean that the clerus will exercise oversight over the legislation, which would give justice a real withdrawal of justice.
Many interpretations are in the draft constitution
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak's governments to suppress the opposition.
After the dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As stated in the proposal, the state should also protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values".
This is drafted on the legal side in such an unexplained way that the content of film art and literature could even be controlled by state institutions through this paragraph.
In a comprehensible speech, it means nothing but censorship.
Moreover, no paragraph defines the explicit equality of men and women in writing.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the reproach or slander of the prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
But it remains unclear what is disgrace and how it will be pursued.
It is equally doubtful that the term "injury of people" is prohibited.
Is that enough for the president's cartoon or for the law enforcement joke?
The point of interpretation, as well as many more in this proposal, which Murcia will submit to sign and, in his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of the human vote.
"Revolution has returned"
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the overwhelming Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered at the Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night for unusual contractions and promised to destroy the Constitutional Charter before paying.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbáhi, who placed himself in third place in the presidential elections.
Nobel Prize winner and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej stated that the draft constitution belongs to "the dump of history".
Through short news service, Twitter accused Mursi's followers of wanting to do a "pus against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition official Yassir Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chálid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee a referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a state-of-the-art ministry, but not out of caution at Tahrir Square, but after a public prayer on the other bank of the Nile outside Cairo University.
She was involved in many veiled women and supporters of Salafists who called out, "People demand the application of God's law."
They called out to Mursi, "Clean the earth," and they said, "The Quran is our Constitution."
The fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrír square, where it all began, would probably cause a situation similar to the civil war.
Apparently, Mursi's followers were not willing to take any chances.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents and the advocates of the constitution’s draft were loud and clear.
Now it's time for the people at the polling stations to decide which direction the country should go.
The majority in favour of the Islamic proposal is considered certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, says Hafiza Abu Sa'du.
The 8th-year-old human rights defender and the President of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or stood trial.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, sentenced, and imprisoned for it.
"And in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' are not even once," complains in an interview for 'Welt am Sonntag'.
Mursi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state forced this lawyer to resign.

Norwegian Raffisk: The most smelling fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret to the success of the country be connected to a local appetite for extremely smelling fish?
Take some mashed cheese.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie down for a week.
So you get the smell of the paralyzing smell of cancer, one of the greatest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, beautiful view - and there's a everywhere smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a salty trout fermented in water for up to one year - depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Nora here in Fagernes begins to gather at a festival dedicated to what is best to say, the most sublime meal.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Howard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rafisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
All around us people eat small cubes of fish and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer to aquavit than a raffic," Howard says.
The drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that was on a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators, fish in the fall plunged into airtight barrels of water and salt.
Then in the middle of the winter, when they were well fertilized, they drew and ate - the senses no doubt drowned with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Nora were forced to leave their land and seek work, most of which were emigrated to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and extensive care systems.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, which was much richer recently than Norway, are streaming into the country for work.
The cancer is seen as an important, inconsequential part of the Norwegian past, although it is a relatively stinking part of the Norwegian past.
It's one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will make you 9 pounds (14 dollars) a piece.
Norway is often not getting into the world's reports - and it seems that the majority of the population do so.
The name Anders Breivika, the right-wing racist extremist who last year shot 77 men, women and children, here people are still mentioning distasteful.
Instead, the shooting is called the "July 22" event.
The Nora can hardly believe that one of them was capable of such brutality and murder in their peaceful land.
Behind Norway's current wealth lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," she says when we're passing plates with the cancer of our waitress Anna's long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of Nordic prosperity.
We're, as you say, considerate people.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is absolutely great.
We don't cheat, we don't like displays.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - except for a small percentage, most of the money in this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading to the global financial collapse threw away money that they did not have, the Norwegians had cords on their bag tightly strained.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat cancer," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow in front of something to eat - cancer is enough.
Such a lot of burger is definitely something else and it's beautifully juicy.
But there's a stinking fish again tonight.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where a rafter is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the most demanding fish.
They're connected to live television, where the modulator and the butterfly is surrounded by racfitic plates.
It's like a Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our stabbing, Howard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man will fall out of the chair, possibly aquavited.
Or maybe fumes from all those fishes.
Enrique Pena Netto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take over the office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best times, steel bars were set up closing several key routes to the capital city and causing chaos on the roadways.
However, the aim was not to prevent those who arrived in order to get to work, but to prevent protestors from gaining access to parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential shar and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenging task.
Mexico was well-economic at the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the midst of a drug war that is estimated to have claimed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a huge commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," President Pen Nito told US President Barack Obama in Ovalna at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Prior to shaking hands with the American President, President Pen Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state, Mexico.
The views on the new leader are different even in his old home, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him well.
Citizens attributed to it the development of tourism in the airport and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pen Nieto has built. These motorways are a huge improvement compared to the lush and rough roads that were here before.
The boards with its name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring a real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state Member for President Pen Niet, Party of the Institutional Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of security and economy that our countries so urgently need.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vincent Fox.
Ambassador Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many waiting inside of Enrique Pena Nieta.
And rejects the opposition characterizing the new president as a man with no substance.
He is a very direct man, very interested in the excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and he's mostly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, there can be no contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo.
Stuck under highways in many places resembles the suburbs of Mexico's capital itself.
And problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help handle drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially the violence against women.
In the last two years alone, dozens of murdered women have been dumped in empty places next to the huge garbage dumps.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place that is synonymous with the killing of innocent women.
At best, Pen Nieta’s critics say that in his role in the office, he failed to deal adequately with the murder of women.
And at worst, his leadership blames the closing of his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a busy neighborhood, Irina Buendia shows me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Marian was killed in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed," said Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of impact on him, and the postmortem stiffening began.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which the one word is "justice."
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what was denied to them.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, troublemaker, and a nun.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there's been so many mistakes and I forget," he says.
The sister-in-law that President Pena Neto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime, and the new president has promised that during his term in office, his priorities will be.
"I hope he will be the same president as the governor," says Prime Minister Olver in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the victims' families in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, says military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse in custody.
Hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on grounds of gross treatment of Manning in prison.
The soldier is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that a soldier named Bradley Manning, who is accused of being the biggest leak of classified material in the history of the United States, missed many opportunities to complain about the rude treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor of May. Ashden Fein during the cross-examination of Private Manning during the preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the weekly visits that Manning had with officers during nine months of custody at Quantico in Virginia showed no complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-examination that took place during the defence hearing to reject the case against Manning on grounds of gross detention at the time of the detention, which is a self-punitive punishment, took place the day after Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
Military Intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein passed a form with Manning, which officers filled out after meeting Manning at the Quantico prison, where he was held in a surveillance regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday about these forms, Manning admitted that the treatment by his guards was considered "excellent" and the overall treatment in the device was considered "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of mistreatment, even though Manning's officers asked directly how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that the concerns about the various problems were expressed orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would be dealt with, but did not notice those problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after they had discussed concerns), and it did not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned them," Manning said.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about dealing with his person in January 2011 when he met with a commission investigating suicidal thoughts, which he had previously expressed in a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to reduce the "prevention of injuries" regime.
The army indicated that it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under surveillance for suicide) to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and once he fainted because of the heat.
He said that not being allowed to know what would happen to him and what was going on in the surrounding world was very discouraging.
"My world snorted only on Arifdjan base, on that cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, a nipple, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleep or just lying down was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint with Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he made in a Thursday's statement concerning the fact that after he had been forced to sleep one night in his Quantico cell naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guard and other prisoners in the morning counting.
Manning stated that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket while counting.
On Friday's hearing, Judge Manning stated that he had judged by the order of his guards that he had a blanket that he might cover, but admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning announced that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his nazouvians to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning told me that night his underwear, his Nazi glasses and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before a military court, his initial trial is expected at the beginning of next year, he will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense stated that Manning planned to plead guilty to lower crimes and that he would fight other charges because they were too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend prison conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon stated that Manning had been held in accordance with the provisions concerning all arrested persons held in custody of the maximum security.
The charges against Manning include aid to the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information concerning national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he's charged at all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient possibilities there are.
The Mexicans have a tendency to blame those who have gone; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are lapen between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital city of Mexico, I barely made it through the crowd and arrived into the area for the agenda of immigrants, where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicanos") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Cizinci").
I was standing there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's an ethnic shortcut, the same as when my friends in Boston are called "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italia".
So I ended up with a "Mexican American" later on.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need to use abbreviations.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in front of the Extranjeros.
I was thinking about the moment that this week the newly elected Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama's White House.
The program had common issues that are being discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is equally likely that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico as if they are travelling to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and to create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he didn't provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite half of Mexican territory into the United States.
But for the Mexicans who think over the centuries, not minutes, the reminders are everywhere.
So one minute after the United States official says something just a little critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and between the elite of complaints about how Americans interfere with the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will walk on the path of war.
And yet for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom it does not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparents, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, this person responded to the profile - dark skins, poor education, the origins of poor villages, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And while we're living an American dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we're living an American dream, not a Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's with the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and view us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico are never strong enough.
Our existence is, according to their opinion, only about failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they'd never have left it.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally in childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans don't like it.
Even though she's a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know feel no part of.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best out of both countries, but you don't have roots in one.
In Mexico, they look at us like Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence want to reconnect with the diaspora, as I learned on my trip.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provider ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and push political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And because of income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure it's a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel uncomfortable about how their family members were treated in a much closer way to the past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The cessation of fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of blood transfusions suggests that each such thing is futile.
Among the common unnecessary speculations about who started it, many buildings were turned into wrecks, more than 140 Palestinians were killed, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time there were rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although it seems that the Israelites and the Palestinians have been trapped in their long conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this could stop their fatal footing.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seem to be not many reasons for optimism at present.
Even if the fires closed on November 21st lasted, the fighting this week would strengthen the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has been ruling in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israel to retreat even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most pitiful and human corners of the planet, Hamas did not fail to destroy Israel.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its buried rivalry from Fatah, the temperate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained greater influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, the restored regional power that once was Israel's closest Muslim ally, has joined Hamas. Likewise, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The Hanging Hamas say that the Islamic half-month is surrounded by Israel, north of Lebanon, where the party/miles of Hizbollah, through Syria, where the rebels, who increasingly adhere to Islamism, can sit down Bashar Assad, only after Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, he changed the rise of the Muslim fraternity under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, far the most populous and difficult Arab countries, the balance in the region.
Husní Mubarak, a secular depot that ruled in Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and his leaders are more influential by public opinion.
In future diplomacy Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be excluded either by Israel or by America.
On the contrary, Israel’s hard - line advocates come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel’s iron dome missile system has proved its worth, and many of Hamas’ rockets have been destroyed.
The Israelites can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as impetuous as ever, and many European countries have also been blamed by Hamas on the beginning of the last cycle of violence.
Above all - Israel prospered, particularly under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who generally ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, in Israel, they have been relatively calm from suicide bombings, partly thanks to the wall that hits the West Bank, the main part of what the Palestinian state may be, and protect Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose side of the Likud at the beginning of the campaign in the elections held on January 22nd, joined the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil the noble Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Coast, wouldn't they be firing missiles like their countrymen did in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they push their heads.
The advocates may win hard lines, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although the Islamists who gain power in Egypt and in other countries do not have Israel too much in love, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel's defence spending is higher than that of all its four Arab neighbours combined.
Starting a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
The fact that President Mursi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a halt to fire is a good sign and can mark the beginning of something new.
The Israelites too should look at the situation from a long - term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates a denial of Palestinian rights to self-determination of a powdered barrel that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - just like a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is weakening in the Jewish state and demographics are exacerbating the situation as the Arab population grows.
Blood discharges against Gaza, which take place every few years in order to suppress Hamas, will increasingly collect diplomatic taxes.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides say, most of the outside world, and these newspapers: two states where Israel will surrender its territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that stopping the fire will give the outside pressure at least a little more impact on the penetration of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 border with an exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from the outside must also push for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than an immediate offer of virtual State sovereignty in the United Nations to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has his part on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first election period, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally irritable in his entry into the process.
That's sadly shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and Palestine.
Laws on ugly cigarette packagings have entered into force in Australia
Invisibly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are displayed warning for smokers and sick parts of the body.
The Australian laws on ugly packagings of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, and the logos and colors of brands replaced the general olive green boxes with hideous pictures of the sick parts of the body and the sight of children and newborns who were sick as a result of the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the different health warnings and images, the only difference between boxes of brand names printed in the same small letter is mandatory from Saturday.
This is the strictest regime in the world with regard to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by removing their attractiveness.
It relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking until they're 26 years old, there's a 99% chance they never start smoking.
"Even in very young children, you can see that you understand the message tobacco companies are trying to sell them together with their product," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek and quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children connect the root in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will have only a small impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been lobbying hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that this law will increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation have serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zoco Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packaging from silicon used to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal regarding laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and expected new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hindrance, experts point to the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan focuses.
In a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and requiring most vendors to hide cigarettes from direct sight, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has prohibited Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you're a tobacco marketing worker and you only have this little space to promote your products, the online space is an insurmountable place to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman noted an increase in the rating of social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, performed by the "average Honzo".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has done the job and created this video, or is the marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia argues that the industry has focused on how it will impose new regulations than on marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacks on new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia trades significantly.
The SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been conducting interviews with other governments that consider similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stronger laws are considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa, and India.
Many smokers in Australia are opposed.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and push the box back," says Victor El Hage when he buys a box with a photo of the tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason I can stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in central Sydney, claims that thanks to the single boxes, it is harder for him to even them in the regulars.
"It took me an hour to deposit the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just completely ban them, then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, we'll close the shop'," he said, and he threw his hands around.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
Last Thanksgiving I spent an unexpected five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next years is quite annoying, despite the dispersion of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention the hollow-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming in with the glory of boredom.
They say it is good for us (and our children) to get bored at times.
It makes the brain go in interesting ways, which can promote creativity.
And given that most of us are constantly connected to some screen nowadays, we have no chance of enjoying boredom.
Should we support boredom, then?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll go back to that.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (Historie nuda) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii, a Latin inscription was found regarding boredom from the first century of our year.
And then there's also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at research literature and presenting the idea of a target group to about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that satisfied me, but I wasn't able to do it".
Boring is different from apathy because a person is not involved in anything, but she wants to be.
He says there's no urge to do anything with apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "the disruption of the attention process associated with the bad mood and the feeling of slowly passing time."
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship, boring people tend to see the problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when we only have difficulty concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attentation", published in September in Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape on which the person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while a third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program silently reported more boredom than the other two groups - had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you are trying to focus on a difficult or seductive task, attention abuse can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "like looking for the wrong parts on the factory line, the distracting music can help you not to be bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and snooping, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more alert.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to spin will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom at some point - the delay in my flight, the sounding speaker, especially the long film.
But some individuals have a better chance of boredom than others.
In the 1980s, scientists developed the "Boredom Proneness Scale" to help measure boredom.
The stage includes questions like, "There are many things I have to do, repeats and is monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally volatile.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would now, 21 years later, be higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "adultation is the supreme time for boredom", which is largely due to the lack of control over what children and young people want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boredom good for you?".
How research shows, sometimes not, because, in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling games, or use addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodánovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nuda is the way of the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain always doesn't know the best thing you should be doing.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will make you happy for a moment, not in the long run.
So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive alone, said Professor Fenski.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will learn not only how to entertain himself but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are in the reach of continuous cracking of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of having to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we're constantly overstimulating," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain yourself when the noise goes off."
There's no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and a Southeastern Colorado football player, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal in the whole state - for holding a few grams of marijuana and pipe that he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one bright day went with a few friends in Lamar, on plans near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After finding a police officer in a marijuana car, Mr Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and equipment for the use of drugs - minor offenses in which he is 100 USD for each fine - and he was given the date of the trial.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on legalising a small amount of marijuana for recreational use depends on the response of hundreds of fewer drug cases on the ground rather than on the right.
Hundreds of offences for possession of marijuana have already been committed here and in the State of Washington, which has approved similar measures, has been abolished.
The police department stopped charging adults 21 years of age and older for holding small quantities, which will be legally permitted after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in the more conservative Colorado districts said they would continue with existing marijuana cases and still blame people for being held.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver are voting towards the western mountains to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana trades in their municipalities.
"This matter is evolving so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads and regulators in the state of Washington.
And they're looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licences for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all within the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is first in front of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now also recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good lead," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the license to sell alcohol to the state of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we could follow," he said.
The Washington Act, the so-called I-502, takes effect on December 6th, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which the state licensing system will not yet exist, but the legal possession will.
And there are heated mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the State directive on "responsible access" to a licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis up to 330 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"There will be no more difficulty in placing licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingstone, spokesman for the Lawyers Centre, recently established research groups.
On November 21st, police chief Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail to his officers, informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer press charges for holding a small amount of marijuana for every citizen over 21 years of age and that the police "with immediate effect" would stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would enforce city laws governing medical marijuana growers and that they would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In the Weld district in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a more rigorous view.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way of pushing users to seek treatment.
Currently, he faces charges of holding 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences that were crimes at the time they occurred," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer blames adults for holding a small amount.
District Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but also decided not to reject all ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the Belarusian voters supported the measures, it will never be easy to bring marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system.
And the counter-actions across the state have revealed, given this great green experiment, a deep rift between local officials.
For district prosecutors, this is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the defendants in possession of marijuana, and the local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent so much of their lives chasing people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to build on a small amount of marijuana like alcohol are Colorado and Washington on the best way to become national drug test cases.
Lawyers and state authorities are planning new frontiers for legalized sales and are also eagerly awaiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider selling and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of legalization of marijuana hope the Ministry of Justice will approve.
Despite several arrests of marijuana sellers for medical purposes and of patients who are using it, who have attracted attention, the federal government has largely left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are probably not going out the door to capture a small bag of drugs, it is likely that the state of regulated trades with recreational marijuana permitted by the new laws will be opened up, said Kevin A. Sabet, former advisor in the field of drug policy of President Obama's administration.
Several cities incolorad do not wait for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved a moratorium on any new marijuana business, even if it would take about a year before any business could be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we give someone a license and then we'll have a big federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our village voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the village voted for, rather than what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative."
Today's university students are not the only ones who are attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever going to school at Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's greatest headquarters of knowledge, the modern-educated Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 1980s, within two weeks of going to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, pack my suitcases and roll into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
Diary Evening Standard claimed I gave up because I objected to the love of students in the next room.
The writer of A.N. Wilson, in turn, declared that I had left because I had been forced to drink out of repressed pots.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my kind of bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was pursued for one reason and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both arid and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly-built adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was the leader of the Conservative Party.
You can ask me why I'm bringing it up right now.
Just because the latest reports indicate that the new generation of students on the right from Wednesday suffers similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR at Corpus Christi College claim that due to their political opinions they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are shown to be unwelcome".
They request the establishment of a position in the University Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that their views can be freely communicated.
Their situation did not help even the recent BBC Two documentary show called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Phaseland: Young, Intelligent and Right) about the student political event, which conservatively described as a virulent and neo-Nazi.
The show was presented by Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OCA), who drove Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a silver stick.
At other colleges conservative students say that they are treated as "postital lambs" because of the introduction of higher education.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday's newspaper that "the left-wing influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
A 21-year-old history student on the Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such climate is "inconvenient", while 19-year-old elected president OUCA Stephanie Cheryl says that there has been a deterioration in the approach of JCR members to the right of people since Wednesday.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one.
I got into September 1986, 18-year-old and protective in a shy way.
Hate against the Conservative side was the hottest.
A year earlier, the university voted against the granting of an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher due to the cuts in the financing of higher education.
In the atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be worried.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students were associating with each other and with the professors, I got a taste of the pelinide that was to come.
I found that not only milk professionals approve of the inculcation of conservative pupils, but they also take part in it with a taste.
A policy of mining, privatisation and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa has been introduced into the wood-based hearings.
My first lecture involved translating the French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please move the first paragraph."
I've had enough of this.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a cake dough, was very gallant.
"Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were poking around.
I have tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your free time, so unless you are too busy with social affairs," Professor Pitt rejected.
I went back to my room in a broken room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight knock on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of UOCA.
"I know who you are," said politely.
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of conservativeism is the target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative champions pretend to be Labourers.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics who (what irony) went to Eton said, "You are the daughter of a Fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students were taking notes with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
He beats each other up, doesn't he?
I felt as the homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet similar people only after dark?
Would I have to change into a labyrinth and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years before me, they've developed as a clearing of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who settled in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative but also for being an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated this place for its province and its diversity and for its attachment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took up professorship at the Bilkent University in Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started driving from Oxford to my parents' house in London, looking for refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political opinions were adopted.
"But it is the best place in the world," said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dream moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His eyes were moist.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Fatigued by frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his conviction.
The next week during the course of the lecture, when another professor of history said in total seriousness that I was a "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I blushed with cold inside, I confessed to "parents brainwashed" and called them "old fools".
The relief was only short-term.
A nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was beaten by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns of Murdoch's papers every week.
My door was locked.
I snuck inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my trunk and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a bruised weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and poison in the educational institution.
More tragic, however, it was Oxford, which not only brought up 14 conservative prime ministers, but which also hides to this day for the undeserved reputation of a place of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance than glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion" opened this week in London, ABC spoke with Nate Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszová and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabela I. Anglické, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentine Garavani's exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the beginning of the famous retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Making", which represents more than 130 models of supreme fashion created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could have been written without his honored clients.
Valentino has always felt charmed by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which will continue until March 3rd, is filled with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Vogel in northern Italy to an idol of international "godhemian trash".
To love the royal family is nothing wrong.
"They at least don't put a bunch of cigarettes in a great carpet, like some wonderful celebrities pop-music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszová.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cabin in Gstaad," explained the ex-wife of Heini Thyssen and close friends of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance than glory.
He's still a star."
Valeria Mazzová plays Valentina
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazzová does not forget the charisma of the designer.
"It's been many years since we went to him for dinner after one show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, ornaments, meals, music, he gave up in all things and was to feel his spirit.
All those invited could feel important and loving," recalls the top model, which began working with him during the 1995 Paris Week of Supreme Fashion.
"Never comes out of fashion, because his designs are artistic works," it ends.
Birth certificate
Gravanius's life is not a story of obsession, but of truly restored love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries was rebuilt on a personal basis for seventy metres of long passage, which offers an exchange of roles: the visitor changes to the model and marches the passage to observe the "presence" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces as a dress she picked Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vittiová wore in "Night", or the coat of wool and fur coat that belonged to the emperor Farah Dibaová.
In the audience of the mannequins of September names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgarska and Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abbascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, "can't forget it".
"I remember perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests "gillettes" and jackets from autumn-winter from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abbascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to be his womanhood and his great love for women because he undermines our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria adds.
"I like the colors that he uses, make a lot of lightening and give "jasker" faces.
The proportions are perfect."
Nor can the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she longed to be a full - timer and had the opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses...
Eventually, she reached the late 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentin for the occasion of a celebration at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress, which had dresses with calls, a stuffed animal and a top without shoulders.
It was a dream that became a reality," says a widow after Rodriguez d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat whose life lies between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not only a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in them."
"King" of fashions
The golden ridge of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Pavel Greek in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "holeks" (as the designer calls his dressmaker) were needed to create these silk dresses of ivory with all pearls, twelve types of various stretches and a tow of four and a half metres.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the biggest authority of the specialized press, these dress-making caps represent the peak fashion of the late 20th century, "return of clients from high society".
Valentine’s dazzled "savoir-être" over the years is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest honours in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and marked by the Order of the Honorary Legion, collects as much honor as any of the husbands of his clients.
"My attention has always attracted his selectness, peace, groomed and perfect look," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"Last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was great. Time left no sign of him."
If the princess says so...
The toughest trade in the world: cheese carriers in the Kawah Ijen area
For four euros, carriers are gambling in the area of the Indonesian volcano with their lives and health when carrying 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hellfire.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who are earning a living by gaining a sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
That's why every day they have to go down to the bottom of the crater, where they avoid the gases from the inside of the Earth, and when they contact the air, they go into a state of stability.
After cutting up large blocks of sulphur that weigh together up to 70 kilos, it carries them on its shoulder in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters, it is only 250 metres, but it takes more than 40 minutes for worn stretchers to climb the turtle’s pace, because they maintain their balance and carefully consider their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could have cost them their lives, as did one French tourist who collapsed from the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilogram of cheese that they earn
When they're up there, they figure out the way around tourists taking pictures of them like they're monkeys in the circus, and they're tired of taking a heavy basket to the weight that the mining company put down a little bit, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is a PT Candi Ngrimbi company that has been operating in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) for a kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of lighters, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even whitening sugar.
"Because we normally wear 70 kilos, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each journey," Anto explains, which usually takes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and the end is destroyed, but he can make 138 000 rupees (€11.5) a day.
Even if it seems like a negligible amount for such a non-human effort, it's three times what he'd make in the field.
"The daily salary of miners is very high here. For example, there are 15,000 rupees (€1.2) per day and the salary for 14 days is two million rupees (€167)," explains the carrier who used to work on the tourist island of Bali as a diaries.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (€6.2) per day and the work was not so difficult, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason which is as convincing in Indonesia as the cheese: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated with toxic gases.
In his 27 ’ s Anto risked his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose cheese has already begun to collect its tax, although his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises more than lasting English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man afflicted with fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead do the work of a carrier.
Shares a dirty wooden hut with other stretchers and each day rises at two o'clock in the morning, because the cheese at night does not stop to check and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue and September dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto enters the crater and illuminates his way with a little lamp that he has fastened on his helmet and bought it for his own money.
About 400 stretchers carry on the shoulder of a basket of cheese from the bottom of a crater
Although the company has high incomes, the extraction of sulphur for cost savings has not mechanized, nor does it provide any equipment for the carriers working on their own and with such efforts.
In fact, they don't even get a share of 30,000 rupees (€2.5) from a photographic supplement, which together with a ticket of 15,000 rupees (€1.2) picks nature park keepers from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle, not for humans," argues Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can work as long as he can, because he needs money to educate his three sons between 18 and 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns the throat and stings in the eyes when the wind turns unexpectedly and catches the miners in the dense fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners are so insistent that none of them complain that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
At the age of 53, an unainnik who weighs his basket on his back can only weigh 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his colleagues dig up 15 tons of sulphur in a volcano, which then three stones take a steep road between the swings into a warehouse in Tamansari 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainnik, opening a wide mouth that lacks several teeth.
Of his five sons, he is the oldest, thirty-year-old, he also earns a lot of cheese.
Time is passing, but the perpetual poverty of one of the world's most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Ilen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy.
Singaporeers say they don't have children, careers, stress and living and education costs.
"Singapore's Population Needs Growth."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're my property.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the Menthol candy commercial, but still - or maybe that's why - the video spread to YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local hints of "put the chick in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which produced the video, hopes that they will be able to point out the problem in a funny way.
Douglas Hamilton, artistic director of the agency, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people do their "civil duty".
"It's all about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was the subject that we had to touch.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot of things like spread perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought why not do the most creative possible thing, such as rap composition, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it very lightly is the Singapore government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and provides financial benefits.
All these measures have had little effect.
Singapore is a rich urban state with advanced technology in the South East of Asia, also known as the conservativeism of its representatives and strict social control.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to population classification is 1.2 children per woman at the moment.
The latter exceeded the birth rate of the value of 2, which is considered to be the restoration rate, in 1976.
Why don't Singapore have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National People's Office's Marriage and Family, says it's because of "better education" and "wider range of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of options as regards goals and priorities, not just marriage and family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and the delay in marriage and childbearing, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While, as part of immigration policy, efforts have been made to increase the influx of immigrants dramatically as a measure to counter the decline in population numbers, it has been a source of dissatisfaction among the locals.
On some Singapore web pages, there are unsecured xenophobias against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a little effort to integrate.
An increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the government party of Singapore recorded its worst election outcome since the beginning of independence.
Following the elections, an effort was made to address the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences in Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence the real estate business.
The Urban Development Authority has started to regulate the number of small dwellings known as "boot boxes", which can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in the shop.
However, there is concern that these apartments can promote youthful lifestyles and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the developer company EL Developers, claims that their "boxes of shoes" are sold much faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular, so they sell for days to weeks faster than houses with a bigger area.
That's why they're so much better for our cash flow."
However, it admits that the new standards lay down clearer rules for developers who had previously been limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too Stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the birth rate of the nation, an interview with Singaporeers working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have a large effect.
"People are still stressed out, homes are expensive, as are education, so many people put it off," a young official says.
"The rest of them have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women refer to careers, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, they're the Singaporeans who have the last word about starting a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to a dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that has a personal character or a "area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any breach".
What is privacy for a person under 16 years of age?
How does it apply this definition in its daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet matters that he certainly would not tell anyone in normal communication?
Reporters from elPeriodico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years of age who are frequent internet users.
In four cases they considered the concept of privacy to be "fully self-owned" in a personal context and as "user name and password", if it was a social network.
"I wouldn't disclose my biggest secret," says ten-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I put nice photos on the FB or pictures of how we play.
I'm also talking to people I know.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on the FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
There's a mother among them who has a name and a password of one of the accounts.
"I set up an account on Twitter to express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone's gonna answer me, I'm just putting them there," she adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast communicating with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't care if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and on the last mentioned network admits that he does not know 20 people on his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, neither one of them taught him anything, nor did he want an address or a phone number.
"If they insist on me or require it from me, I simply remove it from my account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading his Twitter recommendations.
This boy is not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying.
"A well-known social network friend was blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't report from the account.
"Only one activated a private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps how to set the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos known in awkward or awkward situations.
"Of course I would if someone bothered me or just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and a graduate in the field of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents in social networks to be properly oriented, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform them.
He states: "The internet was created as a tool for finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, graduate of education at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital immigrants introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who need to learn them, and we are only learning ourselves," he says.
It explains that it is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at a age when they are not yet ripe for it."
Also, to be, as far as the surroundings are concerned, considerate at a time when what they desire most is to be loved, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," it adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, asking questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porrasová also mentions some of the possibilities: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your picture the way you published your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you're marking people at the party photos, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more: Do everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
Another point is to realize that they have to behave in the environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
"A person is governed by respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet, and the same should be on social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-degree teacher and an education counselor explains that it is necessary for parents of children to read carefully the rules of social networks.
"If they understand each individual indulgence, they have a good basis for them to talk to children about the consequences that they may have on the Internet.
For example, when it comes to age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is key to remind children of the traditional rule "Don't talk to strangers".
Summit of South America ends and Lima declaration has not been published
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without a declaration from Lima, which was approved and allegedly signed by seven present presidents.
The Efe agency has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Offices, who at the outset found that the document would be published after the summit ended, indicated that it would later be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
They also stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press statements.
The press had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly without sound was transmitted in the press room with the report "confidential meeting, audio transmission is not allowed".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press speakers of some governments who were present, but not by a Peruvian speaker.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of the Presidents involved, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail with a "concluding statement" from the summit, but it is only a statement made by President Humala, not an official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and on this occasion it was not originally promised Declaration from Lima, although the press was strongly required.
On the official ASPA website, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that broadcasts were provided to all journalists, but that information was not provided.
The Summit concluded, inter alia, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to the adoption of a judgment by the Hague Court of Justice which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
The President of Peru Ollant Humal and the President of Chile Sebastian Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will begin to discuss the dispute between the two parties, which started against Santiago.
"We will follow and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court," said President Humala and his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be the country respecting international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," added Piñer and welcomed President Humal with his hand in the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two Presidents that the decision of the International Court of Justice was submitted was followed by the adoption of the Bogotá Pact by Colombia this week, which expressed its submission to the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which decided on the maritime border with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely incorrect.
The summit was held without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the appeal of then President Fernand Luga and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollant Humal was entrusted with early speeches and the conclusion of the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The president read a final document informing us that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects between the South American countries had been planned with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Member States of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the South American citizenship objective for which the residence arrangements are extended".
He informed that actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, better access to medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America and joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) is not of a winning nature, but should serve to expand our productivity and to show our nations a better future," said Humal.
"We have decided to prioritise a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links between South America's different places, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in his speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects concerned Peru and its transversal axis from the coast to Brazil, and two related to better links with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country serves to return to the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is holistic and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in a regional meeting that he hoped that on Saturday in Mexico he would meet his Nicaraguan protegue Daniel Ortego to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning a maritime border dispute, which is questionable by God.
"It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortego tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, no one is excluded, nor is there a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega to lead the negotiations as civilized and as clear as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of the then President Enrique Peña Neta.
Within the framework of the summit, the EU Ministers of Defence met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last mentioned country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "really, in this case, South America must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, declared on state television TV Peru that Europeans "killed in World War II" and other conflicts, "but are now practically one country".
In this sense, the project to create South American citizenship, supported by the Member States of Unasur, has been defended.
"There is a need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas of vice that want us back to the past," he noted.
The President of Ecuador, among other things, expressed his agreement with the repurchase of the Organization of American States (OAS), provided that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states would be reduced and those who signed the San José Pact on human rights.
"Those who are in the forehead never commit to anything, and we South American will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the United States is financed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington," said Ecuador's founder WikiLeaks Juliana Assange in an attack on political asylum.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice who asked him to be questioned in Swedish territory because of alleged sexual delicacy, "the Swedish legislation of its own allows for a videoconferencing call that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assenge will have an increase in physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since our embassy, but the Ambassador has informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But it threatens to make his physical and mental state worse because he's locked up in a small space without the possibility of motion in the fresh air.
That would affect everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since June to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European Courts, and stressed that talks were held with London to resolve the arrest of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We don't negotiate human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there were constant discussions.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is leading a series of proceedings at various European instances," he said.
He said, "If Great Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it'll all be over."
And if Sweden hears Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or through Skype, how it makes it possible for the legislation there without problem and, as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be brought to an end tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and explained that he certainly did not tolerate "substantiation, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of the free press are not us, vile and perverted politicians, but bad journalists in the services of profit, pressure and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his satisfaction that even such journalists, "neither bankers, nor hegemonic countries nor bourgeoisie control Ecuador," and said that if he was elected again, "he would continue to change in the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to further maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership in Unasur Union, at least in its next elections, and argued that the whole "must be firm and tolerate opportunism and pucciism covered in legality" because in fact "he destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President stated that he considered it "very appropriate" to wish his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at a time after the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which decided in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the verdict is not accepted.
"It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by will to walk together.
They need to be judged wide to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed his hope of resolving the maritime border dispute in the same Court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries undertake to accept judgment, however hard it may be".
In view of the possibility that he would run in the next presidential election in Ecuador in order to pursue the third mandate, he noted that he perceives this option "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa stated that if he loses his election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
"I have never been very interested in myself, but as unfair a situation as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential period, and then I would have left politics.
If we lose, it's the same for me.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned a new medical treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I actually talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Madur, who says President Chávez went to planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the medical state of the president," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State took part today in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), which was completed by calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS Victims Today Cause Late Diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a lightning hit me," she relates in memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "slow down a bit," but apparently without success.
The boy was hiding it from his family.
He decided to take his illness to his hips himself and started to inform himself of it, with such an assumption that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several fights with disease.
Fabrizio has been living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time, neither the director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) was able to say good-bye, "because he had a severe wound".
That's when AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and to live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their illness and who lose when the virus causes damage to the organism and spread the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years after AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, has been reported in the world, "it is a great success that the length of life of a patient who starts treatment in time and appropriate ways is exactly the same as that of healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital, who confirmed this information in April of this year's prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that survival and life expectancy depend on the degree of disability in the immune system of patients diagnosed with a disease, and those who do not use drugs better: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 may, according to these findings, "live without problems until 75 years of treatment", explained the doctor in his interview.
To emphasise this progress, it should be recalled that the average life expectancy for Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS-UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS according to national statistics.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and by this May 187. Since 2005, however, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
Why do people continue to die from disease?
- "I don't think there's a problem with accessing treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happens at our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't exhausted the supply of drugs. The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of the disease, or at a late stage of the disease."
Adds a convincing note: "Nine out of ten patients are coming when some associated infection occurs. All we need to do to make more impact of overall mortality is to diagnose the disease before, and therefore to a large extent it is necessary to offer disease tests to all those who ask it."
The proposal coincides with specialists and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio who came to test in a private laboratory only because his friend did it, and despite his low age, AIDS has already broken down, and he also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm about to die, I'd rather go crazy three times a week," they say, but it's not my case.
Change was for better, healthy eating, practicing, taking medication."
To this day his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, have a lot of activities, travel, lead an active sex life, but responsiblely, I look out for myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge to share his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISCO, so that today, within World AIDS Day, he motivates those who are afraid of his testimony.
If they've taken risks, let them know if they're HIV positive as soon as possible, it's better, and if they've already been diagnosed, let them know that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible.
This message sums up the AIDS battle password of this year 2012.
Condoms beyond the counter
Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a major failure, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajar journalist who is researching information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are preventable.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, once given to us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but still there are people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most prone to new diseases are adolescents.
"What do you want to do?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health personnel who want to avoid it, says the reporter.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution be changed, that condoms not only be used as counters, but that 100 be placed in the dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It's not support for promiscuity.
It's not even about 'paying a beer and a motel', as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to split condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already lead sex," he noted.
Key numbers in the State of Jalisco
Thirteen,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV) have been reported.
This condition is the fourth place in Mexico in the new and detected AIDS cases and the 13th place in the context of HIV.
92% of the infections occur through sexual activity, 6% by the blood route y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people may live with HIV, since there are four to five people who do not know about the disease on one registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt as established by the competition in Mexico, raises an impeccable precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
Thus, the restructuring procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws do not seem to apply in the country of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hale in the Northern Texas Competition Court leaves, in practice, a Mexican company without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other bank of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door to the Supreme Court of the United States against three irregularities to the main Mexican producer.
The opening point is that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States insolvency law, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure sets out competitive proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational undertakings.
In essence, for this purpose, a model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, which is established by the American Law Institute, has been established.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without voting on the branches of the internal business structure, where the debt owed to Vitro to branches would not be achieved by the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, this option is permitted by Mexican laws.
The fact is that Vitro’s case was not the first to accept this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples such as the Agremex and the Commercial Mexicoan, for which the Federal Contesting Institute has claimed domestic debts.
In addition, it is true that even after subtracting the votes of branches, creditors - who stood against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. "supami" funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited - did not reach the majority.
The vote would reach about 45 per cent to 37.
This data is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From a different point of view, Vitro blames Vitro for the difficult situation since 2008 - on the background of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, Gonzáleze Sada's family company will appeal for a new assessment directly at the appeal court, so that the assessment takes place in full participation, i.e. for the participation of five judges, since there were originally only three votes.
If it fails here, it will require a revision of the higher instance proceedings, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is serious that the court has omitted a document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae service detailing Vitro’s procedure under the Competition Act, which indicates that the company has been relieved by its commitment to agreements signed by both countries to confront the law in question under Chapter 15 of the U.S. Insolvency Act.
In addition, it points out that countries have adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, which is rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: the punishment for Vitro and the State.
Overall assessment
Without note, there was a few months of criminal notice from the Mexican Aviation Committees against the former owner of Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who was accused of fraudulent conduct, and according to the expert organisation of the pilots, the vessel had already expired.
Instance led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed an action against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, charged with obstruction in achieving justice.
According to her, the Authority systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by that entrepreneur, where it selected 198 million pesos from F/589 fideikomis.
The funds were probably directed towards buying shares of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Professional de Hoteles).
As we know, Ascarraga Andrade is the major shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The siege of Dragon Martu
At the Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the association met on the weekend in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Marta in Kankun.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge business and distribution centre with products from the "big wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone in the lower part for employees from 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (Camara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) was able to unite the governors of the south-east zone in an effort to confront the monumental area that would, in part, deplete the protected area and constitute the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of affairs with ACTA document
The application of the Senate, which the Government did not consider requiring an explanation of the circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador of the Trade Agreement against Counter-Fraud, known as ACTA, signed in Japan under the Mexican Industrial Property Institute (Instituto Mexicano de la Proped Industrial), left behind.
As we know, this has happened despite the fact that the Senate itself has ruled out the possibility of viewing it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not to influence those short-terms, Homex has placed investment certificates for 500 million pesos on the market.
This series is the first of the four identical which offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival is born
The association of leading companies in information technologies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet was born with the commercial name Competival, the aim of which will be the market for software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business goes beyond $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketbal was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years involved in this ballroom sport, and he's been traversing the whole world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of local basketball history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
Reyes was before he was stabbed in 2008 by a brain stroke on a roller skater burning into this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, a player of the national basketball league BSN, owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I stayed in basketball during my life with a lot of roles, including several at the same time, as I was the president of the National League of BSN in the 1990s, the head general of the national team and the head of the Federation," Reyes said while visiting reporters of Primer Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has been living for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketbal was my life."
Reyes doesn't go too far in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and memoirs from his long career, testify.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest momentum of all guards, those who resemble his influence in the 50th anniversary of Vaceros, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or owner of the team.
"That was my best years, and I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to participate with the team of the Los Vaqueros since 1967 in the eighth championship, whether as owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one of the championships in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
That's when the team took over Cuco Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and at this time he worked at the Alabama University in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a grown two-foot player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Minci, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to the player Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon victory at the championship, Gausse will contribute to the next."
The champion, when the team was playing Gausse, had enjoyed it, but only a short distance because he had already served as president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and to enjoy Minci's position in the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the 1989 Olympic qualifying match in Mexico.
Then came the world championship in 1990, where we ended fourth, but we should have had the bronze not to be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final execution," Reyes said.
Is the World Cup team in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Panamerican games in Cuba in 1991 when we won the gold and we squandered the United States team, which was quite similar to the one we blew the bronze at the world championship.
This man had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivas, Fica López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francesco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijate" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 for knee injuries.
Males, who may not have had the perfect composition, but who were able to win the gold medal and bring great joy, were the men of the Olympic qualification in 1995 in the Argentine Neuqué.
With players on the crowd, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hurruitner, who replaced the players ruled out because of the match in the Panamerican games in Mar de Plata, we won gold in spite of all predictions.
What was the best Puerto Rican player?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His international tournament numbers are impressive.
None of Puerto Rico achieved such results at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his acting in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla very much from young people.
Which success in the Federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s, the National League of BSN had up to 17 men in one season.
What did you fail to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a division of youth categories according to regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national playoffs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant judges and referees.
Nice to meet you.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, I watch YouTube videos with music from my time, I enjoy grandkids and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman's actor died.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, heard the world's major role of John Rosse Ewing, known as "J.R." in the TV series Dallas, in which he embodies a man who acted carelessly and was slanderous and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as a powerful oil magnate, J.R. Ewing, in the TV series Dallas, became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new series of Dallas, died on the basis of an official family announcement provided by Dallas Warner Bros to the Associated Press company, on Friday afternoon, to complications associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he played again the iconic role he preferred," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman the moment she died in the Dallas hospital," told her agent Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind, and talented, and I'm going to miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life full," said Linda Gray in a announcement.
Hagman's diagnosed liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he had a fatal tumor on his liver, and Hagman had undergone transplants.
Years before the broadcast of the Dallas series, Hagman celebrated himself on TV as a decent guy in a relieved comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His action in films included roles that were well accepted by criticisms: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was until Hangman's master's performance in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R., which led him to the star peak.
The dramatic series of the CBS station on the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan, "Who shot Jejár?", which was to raise expectations about the work of full emotions, when the Hangman figure was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculation audiences around the world, but also the risking of millions of dollars in betting offices.
This also helped to achieve a record in the following.
The November 1980 section, in which the response was revealed, saw an average of 41 million TV viewers, making Dallas the second most fun series of history since the release of the 1983 MASH series, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
On J.R., she shot his sister-in-law Kristin (who played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and then he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy with charismatic smile: a false entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in a treatment room.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be, "Here lies an honorable citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered on Fridays on Hagman as someone who was "great on canvas and beyond".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"It's already finished recording five parts of the second series and the sixth just rolled," the television station informed.
No statement from Warner nor from the TNT station was available immediately after Hangman’s death on how the series will continue.
The family from Fort Worth in Texas was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classical works such as musicians South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950 ’ s, Larry tried his luck at the New York theater scenes and then served in England for the air force in 1952 - 1956.
There he met young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, who he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived in the California city of Malibu for a long time, where there are many celebrities.
In 2001 he published an autobiography book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutey True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything I knew would hurt someone or hurt him," said Prens Asocioad's agency at the time.
After liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped combat patients.
"I love them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
He starts a course that explores the "end of the world"
Every week students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course at the end of the world, he knew that it was an irresistible attraction: the end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar to come on December 21st, many people caught up as proof that the end of the world was coming.
However, Charmé had no idea what awaited him in a few months: the Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call the "long Armageddon", and the growing conflict in which Israel lies, a place in which, according to the Christians of the world's theory, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most japocalyptic semester he's ever been," Charmé told Rutgers University students this week in Camden, New Jersey.
When a person discusses what is happening in the world today as if we had 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for apocalyptic thinking.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Barry Vacker's assistant is organizing a course on "Districts, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We are discussing why these thoughts are expanding over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and explore how different they are from the examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University in Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restaurant and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant of art history and anthropology, came together to organize a course with the simple name End of the world.
"We do not connect the "2012" because we always count on the possibility of organizing the course again if the world does not end," Restaurant said.
Despite the "threatful destruction" students must study, design projects and perform final tests.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work "until the very evening of the anticipated end of the world", said Restaurant.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It's stretched out in two hours," said Restaurant about his course for high-average students, who reported 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received an e-mail asking if there was still room.
Single students make sure the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said at Rutgers University in Camden 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
And therefore, apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he'd seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I enjoy it."
But no confessing student, let alone a professor, did not say he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project has been discussing the Mayan prediction and we're throwing it away in some way," said Julie Zeglenov, a 21-year-old student at Temple University of West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said Restaurant.
But he added that there was an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries in response to changes in its surroundings by predictions about the end of the world.
The Internet has caused these speculations to flourish.
"Jinde doesn't think about it," he said.
This is what is happening in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who lectured this year in the Philippines, asked if he knew about a course on the "end of the world", replied quickly.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote and suggested an exception to the Supreme Authority.
We have mercy on the Pope.
Restaurant noted that over the years many days of the last court were discussed, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, "people start thinking about the next date immediately" or thinking that December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period at which the world will end.
The date is taken by both students and professionals on a light scale.
Several said they intended to go to the "end of the world" celebration.
"I'll call some friends to laugh together," explained 20-year-old communication student Samir Ford.
