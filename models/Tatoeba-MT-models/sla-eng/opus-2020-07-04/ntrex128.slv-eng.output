The members of the Valiant Assembly are concerned that they are "like the Muppets"
Some members of the Assembly are threatened by the proposal to name themselves the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, etc.).
This was due to plans to change the name of the Assembly into the Valiant Parliament.
Members of the congregation in the whole political spectrum are concerned that they will be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Association said that they were concerned in their group "because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp cocoa.
A member of the assembly from Plaid Cymru’s party said that their group as a whole “not satisfied” and suggested other options.
The Valijan Conservative said that his group was “open spirit” with regard to changing the name, while at the same time pointing out that the words of MWP and Muppet were a small difference in the pronunciation.
In this context, the words of the Valiant letter “in” are similar to the words of the letter “u” in the Yorkshire word.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing draft legislation to present changes to the name, stated: “The final decision on possible decribriefers for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be taken by members themselves.”
The Valižan Assembly was empowered by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Valiant Parliament.
For the members of the Assembly, the Commission selected the name “Welsh Parliament Member” or “WMP”, but in the public consultation the most support was given the option “MWP”.
The members of the Assembly obviously propose other options, but reaching agreement will be a difficult task for the presiding official, Elin Jones, who has to submit a draft amending legislation within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes in the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the functions of members of the Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the final vote on their appointment in the debate on legislation.
Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday to turn their country's name into the "Republic of North Macedonia".
By voting, they want to resolve decades of long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of plebiscite to change his name, said he would disregard the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in name is the price to be paid for EU and NATO's accession.
Bells in St. Martin’s Church have been silenced as Harlem Churches face difficulties
"The older people I talked to said they were sometimes bar and church on every corner," Adams said.
“Today there is none other.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People are hanging out today.
Bars are no longer the day-to-day rooms of neighbors where people regularly go.«
In the churches, however, he is concerned that money from the sale of funds will not last as long as leaders expect, and that soon they will be back at the beginning.
He added that churches could be replaced with residential buildings with common administration (condominium), where people would live who would not help shelters in the neighborhood that remained.
“The vast majority of the people who will buy condoms in these buildings will be whites,” he said, “and that is why the day will quickly come when all these churches will be closed because it is unlikely that people who move into these condoms will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built the white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church Community moved out in the 1930s.
The construction was taken over by the Black Religious Community, which performed the worship in the vicinity.
St. Martin’s took over the Black Religious Community under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who is on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of vendors who refused to hire or support black people.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild, they ordered bells to be pressed.
David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s, proudly called bells “bells for poor people”.
The expert who was attached in July referred to them as “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that these were the first bells to be tapped, played by a black band musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he taps the larger bells.
Mr Merriweather said that he was not replaced in St. Martin’s church.
In St. Martin’s Church over the past few months there has been a complicated story with architects and contractors; some have brought church lacquers and others have brought bishops.
In July, the mayor of the parish, composed of the laymen, wrote to the bishop that she was concerned that the bishop would “try to transfer the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the bishop’s transparency.
A shark injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobster at the opening of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just 7 a.m. near Beacon beach’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he dived with his friends when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he swam to him with the group and helped to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the boy was only excited because he caught the lobster, and then he realized that he was shouting "He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had torn the entire clavicle apart.
“I yelled at them all to go out of the water: “In the water there is a shark!” he added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer from the water, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press statement that a few weeks earlier a shark was observed in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper torso.
For 48 hours they prevented access from Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami beach’s in Ecinitas for investigation and safety.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s coming to Boots, Supercool and Debenhams with beauty spots as they have in the department stores, and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beauty market, which is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while the sale of clothes and household appliances is falling, larger beauty spots will be tested in 11 shops across the country and in more shops next year if they prove successful.
To invest in beauty products they have decided that supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves used earlier for televisions, microwave ovens and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s they say that they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3000 products and also include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweizerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space in areas with brands similar to those in shops such as Boots.
Supermarket is also reviving its booming offer of cosmetic products, so that most vegan products – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will try out the concession in two Sainsbury shops. The first opened in Croydon in South London last week and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
As a result of online shopping and daily purchasing of smaller quantities of food in local shops, supermarkets should do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores would be similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to combat the discount of Aldi and Lidl with several services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s group opened outlet Argos in several hundred shops and also the Habitat trade since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased the sale of food and took over more profitable.
Previous attempts at the supermarket to renovate their compartments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s took part in a joint venture with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the alliance ended after a dispute over the division of profits from drugs in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sales of GBP 125 million to GBP 281 by its pharmaceutical company Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, was launched three years ago.
They stated that Lloyds would play a role in this plan as they would extend the offer of luxury leather brands in four shops, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and impression of our beauty spots and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially qualified co-workers who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination which presents a challenge to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is mad because Holly Willoughby is out of a £11 million business.
Dragons Den (Good Business) is furious because the TV leader Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million business with his trademark life style to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their trademark of Truly clothes and accessories.
The company's business couple was compared with Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark.
Head of the show This Morning, 37, posted on Instagram to withdraw.
Holly Willoughby blew up the star of the Dragons Day Peter Jones show, as at the last moment she withdrew from their profitable business with a brand of lifestyle in order to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “beansen” when the Golden Girl TV was on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company headquarters in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that due to her new business, up to £1.5 million — there is no time left to devote to their trademarks of Truly clothing and accessories.
The company was compared with Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark and predicted to double its assets, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly's trademark, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
Source states: “Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
That would be her long-term future for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw was completely astounded by all her involvement.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, because the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the head of the broadcast of This Morning, which is among the most interesting links for banks in Britain, would cost the company several million because of large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and accessories, and additional delays at the opening.
Moreover, this can mean the end of long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
In March, he joined him as president.
The couple had a holiday together, and Jones had a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S trade mark ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I’m A Celebryta.
The source near Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business matters."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked about media criticisms because of a comment made to some by the “non-president” and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, with his mocking “novar” voice, said:
"I didn't give up anything."
His first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's Ri Yong Ho diplomat told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see the "appropriate response" of the US to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead, the US continued to impose sanctions that continued to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results — they stopped rocket testing, helped free hostages, and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded full scene, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said and pointed to a crowd right in front of them.
Cunami and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in addressing the consequences of the Lombo earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombo's inhabitants have been displaced, they have not declared a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not require international aid, so the situation is somewhat complicated," said Sumbungova.
Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palu, but it is not clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
He told Sutopa, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu and determining whether they will be allowed to help international agencies.
Given that the earthquakes in Indonesia are a constant, the country remains completely unprepared for the rage of nature.
Although cunami shelters were built in Aceh, this is not a common practice on other shores.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu may have contributed to the loss of her life, although a warning was in force.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands also in the best of times presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombo to help the victims of the earthquake, sails towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the scene of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improved Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit poses a problem for Jok's administration in re-election next year.
Joko also faces the pressure of long - term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than ten thousand evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge scored for late-warning against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a hit in the 89th minute, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the 1st English League.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiriry's 25-metre mark in front of Chelsea's goal at the back of his team 1-0.
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at the remote gate.
The arrow traveled high above the criminal area towards the right upper corner of the neck.
The ball eventually went down through the doorman Kepe Arrizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I just tried to get to the right position for a ball and players such as Shaq, they always drag it as far as they can, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told Liverpool.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I had not much thought and simply decided to shoot.«
At half-time Chelsea led 1-0 with the hit of Belgian actor Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this fifth action, the attacker gave the ball back to Maté Kovačić and ran into Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith quickly passed in the middle and ran forward.
Then he passed through the defense nicely, and Hazard ran into a criminal facility.
Hazard was ahead of the defense and shot at a remote gate through Liverpool's doorman, Alison Becker, with his left leg.
Liverpool will meet Napoleon at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the League of Champions group.
Chelsea is waiting at 3 p.m. in London for Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia has increased to 832
The number of fatalities of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, a state accident agency reported on Sunday morning.
A representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugro, the news conference, said that many people were affected by a 7,5 level earthquake on Friday, which triggered six-metre waves trapped in the ruins of buildings.
Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is planted with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merceysid.
They found a 44-year-old with stab wounds at 7.55 in the Grayson Mews building on John Street Street and arrested a 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder.
Police are calling on everyone in the area who has seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but I call on everyone who was near the street of John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on all, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the car cam footage to contact us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the crime scene who thought they knew a woman and asked where they found her this morning.
The investigation is under way, and the police keep the women's family informed.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back into his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
The tenants have now been told that they can last several hours before they can come back in.
The policeman heard him explain to the man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
It continues to repeat "this is so terrible".
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon, and another one was immediately outside.
A number of police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
All those who have any information request to write on @MerPolCC call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers Anonymous to number 0800 555 111, indicating the daily 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament has become the newest memorial target of the debate on "the rewriting of history"
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy a number of English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical Puritanism followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has identified Crick’s proposal as “foolishness” and “an attempt to re-written history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of statues, it became clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westmine Palace would become the target.”
The iconoclasty in the English Civil War Cromwell did not even order or execute.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor from the last century.
The magnificent presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is about the 19th century opinion and is part of the history of personality, which some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) see as a protector of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate performance, it is the subject of ongoing historical discussions.
It is clear that in the middle of the 17th century, the dispute has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from the time of Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Killing pig carousels of a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, on the Southwest market, a Chinese pig attacked and killed a farmer.
A man identified only by the name of Yuan was found dead with a cut artery and covered with blood near a pig at a market in the city of Lipunshui in the province of Guizhou was reported Sunday at South China Morning Post.
A pig breed is being prepared for vaccination of pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, she and her cousin were to travel Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a large male pig in a pig's pig with a bloody sponge in it.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had mutilated the farmer to death.
“Bratran’s legs were bloody and maimed,” the cousins with the name “Wu” quoted in the newspaper Guyyang Evening News.
Security cam footage shows Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan wasn't even his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs had closed down, that they would not attack anyone else while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of swine attacks have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, where a man suffered severe bodily injury.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a Welsh farmer by the tractor, but then the woman chased away the animal.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can work as an “improver”.
“We just want to play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to be shown sufficient respect," he said.
Heavy rain comes to the southwest of the United States due to the remains of the hurricane Rosa
According to the forecasts, the hurricane Rosa is moving towards the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico and is weakening.
However, Rosa will bring floods in the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
From Sunday to 5:00 a.m., Rosa is an orcan of Category 1 with wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometres southwest of Punte Eugenia, Mexico.
It's expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, the area of low air pressure moves eastward to the western coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the bay of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm and push high tropical moisture northward to the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisture that will blend with the low air pressure area will then generate heavy rainfall in the wider south-west area in the coming days.
Locally, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will result in dangerous floods, the dumping of floods and the possibility of earth’s beaches in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some places will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest parts, mainly above the larger part of Arizona, it is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rainfall.
Floods can be caused by the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Strong rains can turn canyons into rainy rivers, and storms will bring local sunshine and dust in the air.
The approaching low air pressure area will bring local rain to the coast of South California.
Precipitation of more than 12 mm may be possible, which may lead to a smaller dumping of floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain for the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical floors will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday afternoon and Monday morning, late Monday morning and Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread on all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
In October, great temperature fluctuations can occur in the United States, as the Arctic cools and tropical areas remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa there are 20 degrees of difference.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and widen over again.
Most Central and Eastern America will enter the warm October with temperatures of around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the north-east.
In New York City, we could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good possibilities for temperatures above the average for the East of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have mirrored the questioning of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people on six television networks saw an interesting Thursday's testimony by Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political path has continued, as television stations have interrupted the regular program due to Friday's turn in the last minute: the agreement signed by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, that the FBI will conduct a one-day investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh had found her guilty and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his burning testimony, said that he believed 100 percent that this had not happened.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people are expected to witness on Friday.
The company considered the average television coverage of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that played testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the counting of viewers watching the program in offices.
To make it easier to imagine, viewing is similar to playing the football game finals or awarding the American Film Academy awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads to a full-day hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
Second place is ABC with 3,26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
The interest was also high after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican made a statement to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS recorded how the protesters shouted at him when he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearings of the Justice Committee.
During the engraving, he lifted the view for a few minutes, which was captured live by CCN's television cameras.
“I am standing here in front of you,” a woman told him.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the State?
You have power while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and he added that he would speak more at the board hearing, and then the elevator door closed.
All TV networks were broadcast live even hours later when the Justice Committee voted on the handover of Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate vote.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if they agreed to investigate charges against the candidate by the FBI next week, which the minority party of Democrats called for.
Flakea has been partly convinced of this conversation with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation into the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of "playing political games" in bristice
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May criticised her plans for leaving the European Union for playing political games with the British future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Therese May's arrival at the Birmingham Conservative Party Conference in Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview along with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called brixite plan from Chequers, saying that it was a proposal that Britain and the EU pay customs to the other "most absurd".
Shooting at Waydea Sims: Police arrested Dyneon Simpson suspected of death of the LSU team player
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball team.
According to the Baron Rouge police report, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for charges of second-degree murder.
Officials posted a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police indicated that he had lost his sunglasses during the fight.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on their Simpson DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB’s TV reports.
According to Simpson's interrogation, the police filed a statement that he admitted that he had shot Wade to death.
Security is $350,000, counsel reports.
On Friday, an East Baton Rouge Parish coroner issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are grateful for the assistance they received in the investigation leading to the arrest and thanks to the Special Unit for Refugees of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Police of the South University and the inhabitants of this area.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for their “care and search for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
His father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
On average, the previous season gathered 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade told the team that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" because of Wade's death.
“This is what you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Vulcan vomits ashes on Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes fired by the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighbourhood of the Mexican capital city.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as the activity in the crater intensified and recorded 183 gas and ash releases within 24 hours.
The Centre has observed several cases of thunder and earthquake.
Images on social networks showed thin layers of ash covering windscreens of cars in the vicinity of the capital city of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics observed an increase in volcanic activity lying 72 kilometres southeast of the capital city after a 7.1-degree earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protestors supporting independence faced anti-canced police units and several thousand people joined rival demonstrations, marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarized vote on decommissioning.
The group of masked separatist supporters, held by anti-aggressive police units, mixed them with eggs and metal powdered paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were fights, and police officers had to use farts to stop conflicts.
Supporters of independence who cried out "no forget-free, no forgiveness" for hours have faced protestors who support unity and have shouted "Living Spain!".
According to local media reports, fourteen people in the protests were injured more easily.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, marked illegal in Madrid and celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region that supports independence remain.
The majority of voters voted in favour of independence, even though participation was low, as the opponents of exodus boycotted the elections to a large extent.
According to the Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the region in violent conflicts.
The groups supporting independence camped overnight before the elections in order to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
Demonstrations continued, but they had to take another path.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said he had no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry from happiness because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important, although close victories at the regional elections last December, the Catalonian parties that support independence have been difficult to maintain this year's initiative, as many of the best-known leaders are in voluntary exile or are awaiting trial in detention because of their role in organising the referendum and later declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who made a protest on the phone in support of the police, explained that the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The voltage is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalonian leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the trial began, announced that he would run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
“The running of the European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and oppression seen by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men who hit the house with a car
Three men, 33, 34, and 39, were arrested for repeatedly bumping into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crecent Street on Thursday at around 7.30 p.m. British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged and the building itself.
At some point, they're supposed to be shooting at the car with a gun.
With Menga's hit, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston was amazed by the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox club.
The shooting of Dolly Mengai made a difference, as the team of Gary Holt equated with the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's team thus lost its victory in the guests of this year's championship, and the next Sunday they are facing Hearts, leading on the ladder and behind which they are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone has increased his level of irresistibility in the division to six races and chief coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to experience defeat.
Livingstone wasted his chances against direct guests.
Holt's team should be leading a lot before the hit, as they caused a number of problems with their directness to Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the door, but he sent the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the doorway, and Craig Halket shot his head over the goal.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers because they knew that guests could be dangerous at interruptions in the attack.
And that's how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and hit from the middle of the crime scene.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but domestic defenses couldn't get through, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos raped Kelly's defense.
The Rangers' doorman Allan McGregor fired Scott Pittman with his foot, and Lithgow fired a goal shot from another Livingston break in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingstone's criminal space, but the locals pulled off all the attacks, two crimes – Halket's misdemeanor over Glenn Middleton's replacement and a hand-off — and the judge did not.
"Excellent show" Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBB Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Great show and result for Livingston.
All were excellent, and they continue to go beyond expectations on this path up.
The style of the game and the law have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt needs to be credited for the way he woke up the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket played an extremely important role and well-designed well-organised defence, while Menga was constantly holding on to Connor Goldson and Joe Worralle.
The Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although exceptional under the leadership of Gerrard, these standards are severely lacking.
There were no shots at the goal — only once successfully beat the defense of the hosts — and this is some kind of wake for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the scale.
Erdogana was accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkish accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a giant new mosses.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish populations outside Turkey.
The police, for safety reasons, prevented 25,000 heads of the crowd from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to seeing their president.
It also expressed its opinion to several hundred protestors – many of them Kurds – who do not support the Erdogan government and condemned Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to greet him in the country.
Opposing protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor, celebrated by some German Turks as heroes and despised by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: the biker lost his life in a car crash
In London, the cyclist lost his life in the crash in which the car was involved.
An accident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road in Deptford on the south-east of the city at around 10.15 a.m. in British summer time.
The car driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred only a few months after the cyclist died in a crash in which the driver of the car fled on Childers Street, about a mile [1.5 km] from the accident Saturday.
The police have made a statement that the police are checking the identity of the man so they can alert the family.
They set up roadblocks and redirected bus lines and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a heavily guarded men's prison, reported from the prison administration.
Nered erupted in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30 a.m. after British summer time and still running.
Police officers from the Tornado unit called to handle a riot involving eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor facial injuries on the spot.
The prison staff representative said: "We have called a specially trained staff to handle a riot in HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the staff suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this, and that this may lead to further search for rescue."
HMP Long Lartin prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June was reported to have been the prison administrator in hospital care for being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called the anti-defensive police unit to intervene in a major outburst in which the staff were attacked by pool bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for drylands)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining power of the Rosa hurricane is plunging its way through the southwest of the desert and endangering sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa was supposed to get mad at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be arriving late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix stated that only “ten tropical cyclones maintained tropical storm status or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Orkan Katrina (1967) has raged 60 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the national orcane centre provide 50 to 100 mm of precipitation with individual precipitations up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, between 25 and 50 mm of rainfall is expected, individual precipitations up to 100 mm.
The rain of the hurricane Rosa may be a blessing for areas outside the threat of sudden floods, as drought has affected the region.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the drought is currently taking place in the southwest.
“America’s drought tracking centre indicates that good 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought,” says weather.com.
The route of the Rosa hurricane first leads to the coast of the Mexican bay of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has hurricane power at the highest wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, is 620 miles [620 km] south of Punte Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
The land in Mexico is expected to reach by the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The falls in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great flood risk.
“We expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation from the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of 250 mm of precipitation,” was reported on the weather.com website.
Orkan Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona border in the early morning on Tuesday as tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and south Utah until late Tuesday night.
“The greatest threat we expect from the hurricane Rosa or his remains is abundant rain on the peninsula of Baja Califonia in the northwest of Sonore and the American Southwest desert,” said the National Orcan Centre.
These precipitations can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspected attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found in the area of Excelsion Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4.00 a.m. after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains "stable".
17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, police report from Avon and Somerset.
The police are calling for anyone who might have caught the incident on their mobile phone to come in.
Trump said Kavanaugh "feeling unfriendly and angry" the Democratic party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthlessness and outrageous tactics of a democratic party,” said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said that Kavanaugh “suffered the resentment and anger of a democratic party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday before the congress, and clearly and emotionally denied the charges of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also testified about her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that that day “Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage”.
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the best legal concepts of our time, a lawyer with exceptional records of public service,” told a number of supporters in Western Virginia.
The President mentioned the appointment of Kavanaugh indirectly when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the intermediate elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am really working with the candidate," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claims that the Democrats are on a “trust and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment was expected to take place no later than Friday, the adviser to the Republican party told CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami of hundreds of people killed, the number of victims is increasing
On Saturday, the authorities reported that at least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, and many took away the huge waves that were rolling along the coast.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in Palu, when the six-meter waves hit the shoreline and took many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they became victims,” said a representative of BNPB Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta in Indonesia.
“Cunami did not come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, he hit everything on the ground,” explained Nugroho and added that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, curved and broken bridges and mosses surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, they felt a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released in the Friday strong earthquake is about 200 times higher than the atomic bomb's power in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow bay, is expected to further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugro described the damage as “absolutely” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the buildings, and added, 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugro explained that the victims and damage may be higher along the coast than 300 km north of Palu, in the area of Donggala, near the earthquake epicentre.
As Nugro said, communication is completely interrupted and has no information from the Donggal area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” said the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers are leaving for affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the Agency received a number of criticisms, since it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Palu, but officials say the waves had arrived just at the time of issuing the warning.
In an amateur video published on social networks, a man on the top floor screams to warn people on the street at the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall crashed by the shore and carried away buildings and cars.
They couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video at Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the power outage that broke communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
Authorities report that the military has begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need food and other basic necessities of life.
The airport was opened only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami has increased to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr Dosebe, members of the World Vision organization from Donggale arrived safely in Pala, where employees in the yard set up shelters in front of their premises, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of desolation.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that they did not allow foreign humanitarian workers with much experience to arrive in Pala.
According to the Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, stocks and assistance of personnel are only allowed if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still seen as an accident at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says “OK, this is a national disaster”, we can accept international assistance, but there is no such status.”
The other night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing are holding on to the hope that their loved ones are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days, along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian sailing paratroopers, trained two missing sailboats for the Asian games that ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others, caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, were according to Mr. Mandagi's students.
“As an age in sailing, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon remembers how in the hour when the news of the cancellation of Roa Roa Hotel was circulating across the sailing communities, he in despair sent messages in the application of WhatsApp to the contestants in Palu who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of two blue ones.
“I think this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole USD 26.750 while charging a ATM in downtown Newport on the Lefte
According to the Newport police report, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's security officer on Friday morning, who was filling the ATM in downtown Newport on the Leeve.
The car driver celebrated the ATM in the amusement complex and prepared for the delivery of money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a public statement.
While he was employed, another man “drawled close to Brink’s employee from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to the report, the Witnesses saw several suspects running from the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of people involved in the event.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the suspects should call the police in Newport at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The amendment was sent on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: “Being with the official name Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while and has also used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes just before his performance on Saturday Night Live, in which he was supposed to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariano grande, who resigned for “personal reasons”, said the creator of the show.
The word is a shortening of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word for him has religious significance.
“I think that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means “you” (i.e. you),” West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke to the radio host Big Boy about the title of the album.
"So I am you and I am all of me.
Kanye, meaning “one”, has changed to Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects everything we are."
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire by the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without reason and with great letters.
Mexican President AMLO vowed not to use troops against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians, just as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the market Tlatelolco Plaza that “he will never use troops to oppress the Mexican people.”
At the time of the leftist student movement in Latin America, soldiers started shooting and killing 300 people in peaceful demonstrations on the 2nd of October 1968.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly subsidies and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities to educate young people into criminal groups.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence.
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds it spends on research in this field, says the investor and expert in Kai-Fu Lee's artificial intelligence who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to be the best in innovation in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are quite good for the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the possibility that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the US, Lee told CNBC about an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpoints: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In 1980, Carnegie Mellon University developed an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranking U.S. player of the Otello game and later became the CEO of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee said he was familiar with the previous American government's technological competitions, such as the robotics competition organised by the DARPA Agency (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when it would be next to find the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, but it’s companies,” Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have worked best with universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that people with a doctorate from artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
China's National Science Foundation finances people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is worse, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrow committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of $2 billion.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that wanted to create the National Safety Commission for artificial intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide at the referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday in a referendum to turn their country's name into the "Republic of North Macedonia". This would resolve decades of long dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has lodged a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, governments reached an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote on the referendum, and the campaign of boycott expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 %, as long as it was necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum charter was: Are you a member of NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this price, worth paying for joining authorities such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, is one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia to be free to live under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, sufficient members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote, which will be decisive.
Change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been reported within 13 hours.
However, participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our city is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an electorate from Skopje's capital.
On 30 September 2018, the Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško delivered their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country, which would open the way to NATO's association with the European Union.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not through the back door," Kavadar said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring a badly needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour of the fact that more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the handover of his electoral charter.
He added that it would be a positive result of “the confirmation of our future”.
A survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that the referendum would take place between 30 and 43 per cent of voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV Telma showed that 57 percent of those questioned would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the vote must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would mean the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government, which took over its mandate last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City played over Brighton's entire defense and won
On Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won Brighton's defense at Manchester City with 2-0.
Aguero's hit in the 65th minute seemed ridiculously simple.
At the beginning of the campaign, the Argentine attacker took the launch at the centre of the playground.
He ran between three Brighton defense actors and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defense player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he handed Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in the criminal area, the English attacker returned the ball to Aguerre, who beat Brighton's goalie Mathew Ryan with his right leg and sent the ball to the right side of the network.
"Aguero is dealing with leg problems," said coach of City Pep Guardiola.
«We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who provided the blues with an initial advantage in the fight of the first English League.
The goal was reached in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Sanej on the left-hand side.
Sane touched the ball a few times, then sent the ball to Sterling against the remote gate.
The Blue Blue Attacker pushed the ball into the net just before it flew past the goal.
On Tuesday at 12.55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, he will meet with Hoffenheim in the group of the League of Champions.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their options for the title
The Nationals team is out of range, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes that Sunday he will be able to climb the pitcher's hill against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if the Rockies still have a chance to play in the finals, since in the Western League they have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
The Rockies won the 5-2 on Friday over the Nationals team provided the least invitation to the organizer, but still waiting for their first address in the division.
"Although we cannot gain anything, at least we will be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a great crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level this year.
So why wouldn't you want to compete?«
Nationals hasn't published the name of the first shooter for Sunday, but it's probably gonna be metal Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who will be the first to metal for the 34th time, was metal as a debilitating player on Thursday and would have had enough rest days by Sunday.
The Washington right-winger collected 18 victories this season and 7 defeats with an average of 2.53 and 300 discharges with strokes in 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at meetings in Western Virginia
The President indirectly touched on the situation regarding his choice for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican electoral participation in the interim elections.
"Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I really try to run, so I fight everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "We have this terrible, radical group of Democrats, and this is happening now.
They're determined to regain power, and they're going to use all the resources they can, and you can see the shame, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to gain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission of “confidence and obstruction”.
“And you could see this in the last four days,” he said and described the Democrats as “harmful, evil, low and lying”.
It was named after a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, and there was a loud disapproval from the audience.
»Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, um, no, no, wait, that was a really bad body talk, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
Those who express their opinions are impatient.
When the activist of the Momentum told me my local client, it wasn't even a surprise.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament from a Labour Party to express my opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has been similar because she has strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a non-confidence motion for me not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
As to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe. Ironically similar issues about which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
In the notice of Friday, the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In the eight years that I was a member of the local Labour Party Parliament, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly the same.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings do not use such a tone, and the promise of a "more friendly and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is increasingly evident that the different views in the Labour Party are not admissible and are, in each opinion, assessed whether this is acceptable for the management of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and they are colleagues, whom I previously thought we were sharing similar political views, who expected me to change my mind and take a position with whom I would never agree – whether in the field of national security or the single market of the EU.
When I speak publicly — and it doesn’t really matter what I say — they follow the criticisms on social networks that call for non-selection, judge the middle policy and tell me that you shouldn’t be in a Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Actually, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I'm about to make are just political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who encounter floods of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how abuse rates have become quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with each proposal of the non-confidence or change of customer choice rules is becoming more difficult.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to bow my head and not to be so loud, but I will be "all right".
But I didn't go into politics for it.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student – the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which has caused the school to literally collapse in my primary school – I tried, as a local councillor or government minister, to seek better public services for those most in need.
I've never hidden my political beliefs, including my final elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas that I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country sails against the bruxite that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of non-choice or political suitability will deter me from acting in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament from Nottingham East.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr to the top of the scales
Two well-known attempts have distorted some of the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned a victory in this wonderful first-day fun game.
Now they're on top of the scale, and they're the only unbeatable team out of ten.
Finally, the weight on the home side hung their top-notch defense and better exploiting the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
"In our games so far we have passed many trials and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The Ayr team's congratulations, the opportunities have been used better than we have."
The score of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, was led by Ayr to lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was given in the Warriors game, meant a numerical breakthrough for Melrose and Jason Baggott, he intercepted an attempt without conversion.
At the time of the crime, Climo increased the lead to Ayr before he hit it right at half-time and then converted the independent attempt for result 17:5 to Ayr at break.
But Melrose was very good at starting the second half and trying Patrick Anderson, who was converted by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
It was followed by a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, which was carried out on the stretchers, and later Ayr progressed by the attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
The interim captain of Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose again used the game with the player more by the unconverted attempt of Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Clime-free interference, MacPherson reached his mark in the attack.
Clemo scored points after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent a wingman named Gregor Henry in his fifth host attempt.
Still Game series star starts a new career in hospitality
The Star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is obviously going to the inn, so it's supposed to be the director of the licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old in a popular BBC series, for which he also wrote a script, plays Jack Jarvis along with his longtime partner in comedy by Greg Hemhill.
The twin reported that after the next ninth season, Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official documentation, Adriftmorn Limited is the director of the company.
The player did not want to comment on the story, but the source suggested Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would be included in the "flower hospitality" in Glasgow.
“The seas are ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Navy patrols at the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings feature the blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with slogans: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to repay it."
In inland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of coastline in bloody conflict due to the natural resources of Chile in the 19th century is still alive — as is the yearning for a return voyage across the Pacific.
This hope may now be the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision that will be received on 1 October after five years of consultations.
"It has a momentum, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit, expects a result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia, which claims that after decades of precarious discussions, Chile must negotiate on the access of Bolivia to sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who next year is facing a controversial battle for re-election, also has high expectations regarding Monday's ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court will not decide in favour of Bolivia — and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body established in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate the territory of Chile to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after they have listened to the final arguments means that the case “was not complicated”, said Paz Zarat, a Chilean expert in international law.
And for the last four years, they have not spoken in favor of Bolivia, but they may have a great deal of it.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the question of access to the sea,” said Záratjev.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric of the Chileans blew up all the good things that might have remained, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The nations have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusual decision quickly.
Monday, Bolivia will bring “an excellent opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139-year-old disagreements with each other’s interests”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as political resistance.
“It will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea has declared that nuclear disarmament will not happen if it cannot trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons unless they could trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
The United States called for the fulfillment of their promises made at the meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Minister Mike Pompeo is evidently ahead of the relaunch of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unom in Singapore.
Ri says the US is wrong if they think that the continuation of sanctions and opposition will bring the end of the Korean war to North Korea on its knees.
Washington is careful to secure the forecast without Pjongjang first taking decisive measures to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is general doubt that Pjongjang is serious about abandoning the weapon that the state sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
The fashion magazines in Paris reveal the newest line of huge covers that come to shops with affordable brands near you
If you want to complete your collection of cover or hide completely from the sun, you do not have to keep looking.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their spring and summer 2019 collections on the fashion script a collection of strange overcoats that blinded the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical cover was flooded by Instagram this summer, and designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashionable pistachios.
Valentine's piece, which stood out most, was a hat in a beige color with wide edges decorated with feathers-like accessories, in which the heads of models were completely lost.
Other too fancy accessories included watermelons with precious stones, a magic hat and even a pineapple – but your heads will not warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks — just the right time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have sewn lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashion.
One creation was similar to that of a breather and an eye, and the other looked like a corona with a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
The fashionable know-how predicts that the giant roof will come to the shops near you.
The broad hats closely follow “La Bombi”, a straw hat with a 60-centimeter pitch, was observed on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand for extremely impractical hats, which flooded social networks, sent another large creation in fashion — a straw bag for the beach, which was almost as big as the model in the bathing suits she wore.
The bag of raffia in roasted orange colour, rounded with raffia and with white leather handle, was the central piece of the collection La Riviera, the designer Jacques for spring/summer 2019, in Paris week.
The Stylist of the famous Luke Armitage said for FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops for the next summer – because the designer has made such a strong impression, the demand for too many supplements would be difficult to overlook.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial to global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the examinations that are further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (CSIS), seek to provide the highest level of service for their pupils and their parents.
Single schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the place they have as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a tailored school programme, we see modern languages as still a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, the conversation is reflected in his memory.
But if you talk to a person in his mother tongue, the words are embodies in his heart."
It is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's recent exams show that languages are at the top of the scale with the highest levels of performance in independent schools.
68% of students learning a foreign language achieved an excellent assessment.
The data collected in 74 schools in the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72% of pupils achieved an excellent rating in Mandarin and that 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students received an excellent rating.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are considered as an elective subject in the curricula of separate schools and are treated in the same way as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A study carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that, for the reasons why employers are being tortured to fill vacancies, 17 per cent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
In future employment opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, whatever career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can directly communicate with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
A 2013 survey of YouGov covering over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to talk, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, that is 15 percent.
So investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
Schools vary in the languages they teach in Scotland.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are supposed to be of major importance to the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, many of the languages taught by experts in this area will always be available in separate schools.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country and must therefore also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Single schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien only ferre.

LeBron will be debuting in the Lakers' jersey Sunday in San Diego
For fans who are looking forward to the first performance of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting will soon be over.
Coach Lakersov Luke Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
“More than one and less than 48,” explained Walton on the official Lakers team website.
The official reporter for the Lakers Mike Trudell team wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers race before the season.
"At this stage, I do not need my career to prepare before the season," he said.
Trump convention in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of conventions in his campaign today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled conventions next week, including the stops in the favored countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As his candidate for a seat in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the forthcoming interim elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s convention in West Virginia take, and where will it be available online?
Trump's convention in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 7 p.m.
Trump convention in Western Virginia can be viewed live online on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about hearings of a candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court this week, who have become tense because of allegations of sexual misconduct, which is why the Senate confirmation is expected to be postponed for one week in order to conduct an investigation by the FBI.
However, the primary objective of this series of conventions is to help Republicans, who are awaiting a major election in November, to gain a new momentum.
Thus, in the campaign by President Trump, these five conventions were intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, reports Reuters.
“Congress supervision is so important for his programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the tough season of the campaign,” said a representative of Trump’s campaign, who does not want to be named.
Today's convention in the centre of Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, which would attract interest in Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit Western Virginia for the second time in the last month, where in 2016 he received more than 40 percent of the points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public research.
“To Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the President must come and raise him in public research,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: US team still wants to win and keep hope from Sunday single fights
After three one - sided games, perhaps the Saturday afternoon fights of two couples (foursome) were what Ryder’s cup needed this year.
A moving trend is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where's the fluctuation going now?
"They had six points of advantages, but now they have four, so this is probably a new momentum for us," said Jordan Spath at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage because it leads to four points and can get twelve.
But the Americans, according to Spith's words, feel that they have the wind in their sails, and among other things, they have been encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day long and have won three points out to four.
Pete was determined from the initial blow to the vegetables and gives a good example.
The cries of happiness continued to become louder and led to a decisive blow when, after Thomas and two points were delayed, he and I were tied to the fourth game.
The striker who brought them a victory at the 15th hole accompanied a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes that the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” said Pete.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to glory.
The only player with more points than Spith and Thomas have in the last two days is Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder's Cup.
Unusual but charming twin Europe has won four out of four points and are indispensable.
The double "Molliwood" was the only one who didn't hit the buggy on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the buggies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and a way in which the energy flow between them and the loud audience is clearly confirmed by the fact that they are the same players that will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player would be better able to seal the potential victories of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Probably both at the same time in different holes.
But talking about European glory would be perplexed.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game that was paired with Alex Noren.
Due to the buggy and two double Bugs at the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish fell into a crisis from which they did not find a way out.
And on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Games with four balls and two pairs of matches are an exception to the interesting observation from close communication between couples, the advice they give themselves, the advice they do not give each other, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better than a team so far and has a great advantage before the last day, but the fights of two couples have shown that the US team also has a desire for victory, which some, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe goes on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a nice advantage after Saturday's four-ball games and two-track fights lead by 10:6 to the United States.
The excellent couple made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari gave their best to each other and with two victories over Tiger Woods and at the Le Golf National field, he scored four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to win the trophy that she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, had a four-ball victory in the morning over the American sinning team and led in a string of 3-1.
The U.S. team fought better in two fights, where two games were won, but they couldn't catch up.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual battles if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points, while Molinari (the couple named "Molliwood") after the sensational end of the week was the second couple who won four points in his first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After winning the game over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they turned out to be more convincing to beat the spent Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at times, but lost 19 out of 29 games in four games and two matches, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning games with four balls, returned to fight two doubles and paired with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1 defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were ranked first and third on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not all went according to the plans of the team of Europe.
The three-time winners Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they won decisively against Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in two pairs, losing the first two holes.
Just once in the history of Ryder's Cup, the team returned after a four-point delay before the individual fights, although Fury's team needs only an equalization to preserve the trophy.
However, after two days in the second place, Sunday’s counterattack may seem to be too high a supply for it.
North Korea: "We shall by no means disarm ourselves unilaterally"
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister announced to the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions caused growing distrust in the United States and that North Korea would certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had taken a number of “important measures in the sign of good will” in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile attempts, crushing the city for nuclear experiments and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate US response," he said.
“Without confidence in the US, we will not be sure of national security and under such conditions we will not unilaterally disarm the first.”
While Ri repeated known complaints from North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would have been rewarded for taking gradual action, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as had been done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jung Una and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June. Kim committed himself to pursue the “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump North Korea promised security assurances.
North Korea wishes to have an official end to the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pjongjang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to give rise to calls to release the severe international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
“THE EU is insisting that we first have to disarm nuclear weapons, and that we step up the pressure with sanctions to achieve our goals by force, and in addition, they even object to the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri reported.
"The idea that sanctions could get us on our knees is an unrealistic hope of people who do not know us at all.
The problem, however, is that further implementation of the sanctions further deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the US President at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's President Mun Dja In, which took place in the past five months, and added: “If we talked to South Korea and not the US about the problem of nuclear disarmament, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not agree to such a dead point.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from last year when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that the attack on the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets was imminent, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump Kim marked the "murderman" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations Assembly and his courage to take disarmament measures last year, but said that he had much work to do and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea was nuclearly disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no scheduled time frame for this, saying: "Travel can be two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue decisively without exception until we recognize the complete, complete and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to prevent the financing of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pjongjang would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
After leaving Pjongjang in July, he declared that progress had been made, and North Korea had criticised him for being "gangster" in a few hours.
At a meeting with Muno this month, North Korea committed itself to undermine the missile testing station and the nuclear infrastructure if the United States were to take "appropriate measures".
I would say to Munu that with the "appropriate measures", Trump promised security assurances in Singapore and measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University attend a course in which they learn to take sufficient time to relax
The aim of this year's new course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With this course they want to fight against a growing masculinity culture of “perennial” learning, in which the powers are accumulated with caffeine.
A university professor found that students of the best world universities often do not know the basis of their own concern.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of medicine sleeping at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that, according to his first type, was in the United States.
Following his lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he decided to conduct such a course.
After the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why do I know this now that I’m in my last year?”
She said that no one had ever told her how important the sleep was, and for The Daily Telegraph, the professor told her that it surprised him.
The course, which is being conducted for the first time this year, speaks of the key importance of good sleeping habits for learning and sports success as well as for improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Chief of Medical Services of the University, says that they decided to take such a course when they found that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The single course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the door of the student home where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on sports success and the importance of sleeping routines.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that the behaviour of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to learn these facts, just as they have the right to know how cigarettes are affected by their health," adds Professor Cheisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride in the “survivor of all-night learning” is still present. He also adds that modern technology and growing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, present a growing problem.
Professor Ceisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This can also avoid weight gain – the brain, due to lack of sleep, move into a hunger mode, making students constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Cheisler shape the course last year. He attended one of his professor's lectures during his first year at Harvard last year.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student village.
He hopes that he will be able to ask postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students set up a sleeping alarm and wake-up alarm device. He also wishes to alert them to the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, as it can cause the imbalance of the circus rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingstone : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with hit drowned Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston proclaimed team Steven Gerrard sentenced to defeat with 1 : 0.
The team from Ibrox was hunting its first guest victory after February's reign at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4 : 1, but Gary Holt's team defeated her in 18 games since Gerrard's team led by his team for the leading team of the Scottish League behind 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the chosen range of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
This led the Rangers to fall to the common city, and Livingstone progressed to the third place, but with the difference of the goals, Hibernian team became lagging behind.
The problem of the Rangers was not over yet. Calum Spence, a judge by side, suffered head injury when an object from the site of a visiting team arrived after reporting it.
Gerrard took eight shifts in a crew that beat Ayr without a problem and went to the semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt was holding on to the audited Livingstone unit, which had taken the point of the Hearts team a week earlier, and undoubtedly was impressed by how his escaped team effectively neutralized all attempts by the guests.
The Rangers did have a higher ball, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after the start of Menga's first short pass found Scott Pittman, who then went to the goal of Allan McGregoor, but he was an inaccuracies and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs was then achieved by Captain Craig Halketta, but the balls then his defence assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score the goal.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire for victory.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after a crash with Steven Lawless, after 15 minutes, a criminal shot had to be made available, but Judge Steven Thomson put the Colombian demand in a ditch.
The Rangers were able to assemble only two shots at the goal in the first half, but not a head shot sent against the goal by Lassana Coulibaly, not even Ovie Ejari's wreaky ball, did not pose any danger to the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly.
Livingstone's introductory goal at 34 minutes may have surprised everything, but he was already fully deserved because of his persistence.
Rangers haven't been able to cash out another Jacobs' long feed switch.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared the Mengi application for an easy conclusion to the attack.
Gerrard acted and exchanged during the break of Coulibaly with the wingman Ryan Kent, who immediately proved himself to be the Morelos, but Kelly ran effectively from his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests to play his game, taking care of several pitches in front of the goal.
At the end of the game, Holt's team could have increased leadership further, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was unbiased after the cat feed.
In the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the chance to shoot Jacobs at the end of the game, but Judge Thomson did not admit it.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger counter
We present a page from the almanac of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, so on today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany “Hans” Geiger, who later became a world-famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger counter.
This became a constant in the scientific world, and he also got his place in pop culture, as in the 1950 Bells of Coronado, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play a cowboy scientist:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is Geiger's counter. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on headphones, you can actually hear the effect it has on atoms of radioactivity in materials.”
Evans: "Madonca, they're really talking now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 only a few days before 63rd birthday.
And the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify attacking cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify and destroy attack cells
The vaccine in the context of therapy teaches the immune system to identify attacking cells
This method includes the development of immune cells in a patient who are then modified in a laboratory.
After this, they can “see” a protein that is characteristic of a number of cancers, then returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that taught the immune system to identify the attacking cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the development of immune cells of a patient changed in the laboratory to see HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, and then reinject.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Research Institute from Bethesde in Maryland said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promots the growth of several different types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells from patients who were “taught” to target cancer cells was also involved in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West performed a protrumping point on the SNL with the inscription MAGA on the cap.
The Community Was Not Impressed
Kanye West was performed in the Saturday Night Live studio at a strange point, among which he expressed his support for US President Donald Trump, and said that 2020 would compete for the chair.
After the third song of his performance, called "Ghost Town", during which he was wearing a hat with the inscription "Make America Great Again", West started attacking Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
"A lot of times I talk to a white man and he says, "How can you like Trump because he's racist?"
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago," right.
This series of SNLs began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which a hollywood player sulked from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Justice Commission, accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
The video of West's monologue was not played, but it was put into social networks by Chris Rock.
It's not known whether or not Rock was going to make fun of West with this.
West complained to the audience, among other things, that he had a few problems in the back due to his stroke.
"They came after the stage for me.
They said to me, "Don't go to the stage with this hat."
They were harassing me!
And they say I'm lost," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that he had to wear “Superman’s cape, because it means that no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments were prepared at least twice by the audience to whistle and members of the SNL team were clearly indignant, and someone also said about Vanity: “In the studio there was a death silence.”
At the last minute, the West was invited to a goat exchange for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has already caused a lot of amazement by video for the song “I Love It” where he wore the Perrier mineral water bottle.
Westa was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSa Conservative Group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: HVALA, THAT YOU ARE SINGLE RAJ.”
The talk director Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “what it is, and that’s fine. ”
However, I will NOT reward anyone (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his “art of art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and extends the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we added," she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and will now be “a battle formally known as Kanye West. I am YE.”
He's not the first musician to change his name, and he's already done it before him, also known as "Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy."
His stand-up colleague Snoop Dogg used to call himself Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: Prince turned his name into a symbol, and then he was an artist once known as Prince.
Men charged with attempted murder for stabbing a person at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police say it happened in Ballyhackamor.
The defendant has to report to the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
A Star of the Games of the thrones of Kit Harington came up sharply against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his cheering sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval coloring fantasy series Games of thrones.
A 31-year-old actor who strongly condemned the stereotype of masculinity hero says that due to the appearance of such roles on screen young boys often feel that respect can only be earned with a hard life.
Kit told the magazine The Sunday Times Culture that something had gone wrong in his opinion and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic men during the #JazTudi movement.
A player who recently married a 31-year-old co-player from the Rose Leslie Games admitted that he had strong beliefs about this subject.
"I personally am now seriously asking where we have made the mistake of reaching the manhood," he said.
“What have we taught men as we grow up about the problems we are now facing?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing the toxic manhood by displaying very manly characters.
He continued: “What is born and taught?
What are we taught on television and on the streets that young boys feel that they have to choose this particular side of men?
I think one of the important questions of our time is how can we change this?
Because apparently something went wrong with young men."
In an interview, he also said that after the end of the series the next summer he would not participate in the recording of any prehistoric or continuation of the Games of the Capitals, because he “has concluded with the battlefields and horses”.
Kit will play in November as the main feature of the new show True West Sam Shepard, a story about the film producer and his brother robber.
The player recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of the Games of thrones was that he met his wife, Rose, on the tape.
“For this series, I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
Rose is in a fantasy series, awarded with Emmy, played Ygritte, the love selection of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the village of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been sexually transmitted, which represents a change compared to the past.
In some parts of China, HIV has usually spread rapidly due to blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials from the Junan province conference, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost nothing.
Yet, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is still increasing by 100,000 people a year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a very persistent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against people in the LGBT community is still very common.
Since conservative values are still in force in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men are eventually married to women, according to research results.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of the effort to solve the problem, the Chinese Government has promised general access to medicines for the treatment of HIV.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff have issued data on Republican senators, condemns “hazardous lies” and “controversies”
On Saturday, American Congresswoman Maxine Waters rejected allegations that a member of her staff had published information on three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these accusations came from individuals and websites of the extreme right.
"False, lies and more intolerable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
This information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during the Senate's meeting on allegations of sexual harassment of a Supreme Judge candidate, Brett Kanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators had finished hearing Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicate that via IP it is possible to identify a source of publication that is supposed to be connected to Senator Waters' office and conclude that information has been published by one of the staff, Hill reports.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false and pure lies” continues Waters.
"My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are at risk because of these false accusations, are not at all responsible for the leakage of these data.
These unfounded accusations are completely untrue and pure lies."
Senator Waters' statement quickly ran into critics online, including former White House Press representative Ari Fleischer.
From this denial of anger, Fleischer wrote.
"This could mean that it's not from a real test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he has not done, he must not show anger.
He can't fight it.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
He must remain calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' response to Judge Kavanaugh's democratic criticism, accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes for Waters in the mid-term elections, came on Twitter.
“If this is true, it is serious”, he tweeted.
Watersova stated in her statement that her cabinet had informed “the relevant institutions and law enforcement authorities in relation to these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be disclosed”, she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for tips on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and is also valid for the revitalisation of Johnny English’s action comet for the first time in 2003 entitled Johnny English and continuing in 2011 entitled Johnny English 2.
Will fun satire be about how much we fail, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English with exposed eyes and unusual shimas is granted permission to re-mix the charred ones; his name already indicates that it is a comic character created for a cinematographic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
It is a clumsy secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains part of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's pitch and the smallness of the one who contributed the last note of Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also based on a traveler and an international mystery man, played by Atkinson once in the now forgotten TV commercial for Barclaycard, leaving behind real chaos.
Although one or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching in a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor's leaves were short on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems somewhat mild and excessively unnecessary, especially because "serious" films, such as 007 or Mission impossible now without a bad conscience offer comic elements.
It seems as if humor is intended for children and not so many adult viewers, which is why Johnny English's adventures are not as innovative and oriented as the Atkinson's silent leaps into Mr Bean's role.
The constant theme now seems to be that the UK is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated an online network of British most secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing major problems to the competent agent, represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is the turning point for the prime minister, a pomposite figure that has already suffered a fracture due to political unlovingness: Emma Thompson has tried to play the supposed Teresa May, but there is nothing in the script that is tangible that she can help.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies are exposed, so it has to decide for one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prestigious school who informally teaches how to work undercover: here are the scenarios hit, because English is doing some sort of spy "rock academy".
The English are taken to Whitehall at an emergency meeting where he meets a longtime associate of Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotyping sports fan, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine gets a little lost.
Thus, Batman and Robin are ready to create more problems in the name of the secret service of her Majesty, and they meet the fatality of Ophelio Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously coming under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their decoy: dressed in a waiter planted a fire in a French restaurant, created chaos when they crossed over on the roof of Volt's yacht, and when English tried to use glasses for virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of Volt's house, he managed to create general chaos.
Although the final part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathetic and energeticity it resembles a child’s film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English movies, I can't help and think: is the British film Atkinson able to play a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labourists deny that they plan a four-day working week for the British, with payment for a five-day working week.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby is thinking about a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a payment for five days.
A party from business leaders wants the savings created by companies due to the artificial intelligence revolution to be transferred to the workers and to allow them an additional day off.
So employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high wage.
Sources say the idea fits the customer's economic plan and plans to put the country on the side of workers.
Unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party stated for The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is supposed to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-week worker is the goal we will strive to achieve with the customer's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the customer."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported a four-week working week in its general elections campaign in 2017.
At present, however, this objective is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-week working week is not a party policy and the client does not think about it."
The Chancellor in the shadow of John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to rip out the power of “disciplineless directors” and “profit-making” in municipal companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current stakeholders in water companies may not regain their full share again, as the labyrinth party could introduce "refoulements" on the basis of alleged injustices.
It also confirmed the plans for the inclusion of workers in the Management Committees and the introduction of the Equity Funds, thereby transferring 10 per cent of the share in private companies to employees who would thereby receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed in the "60 Minutes" ('60 Minutes") whether their opinion could change the investigation of Kavanaugh carried out by the FBI.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, by the FBI, delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question whether the findings of any Republican senator could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview carried on Sunday, the correspondent broadcasts “60 minutes” to Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asking if the FBI could detect anything that would change her mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to that than a fellow from South Carolina.
“I think, of course,” said Kennedy.
“Before the hearing began, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this accusation came forward, I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, irresistible, unequivocal."
And Graham's voice seems stuck in the stone.
“I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason to change it,” he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it, ” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she called could confirm it.
The case is 36 years old.
I see no new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens' Festival, an annual music event where a truly remarkable set of stars participates and has the same unique mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will be held this time for the seventh time, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will occupy a large track of the Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the abolition of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens' Project, an international advocacy group hoping to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting actively against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a series of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a telephone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is the movement of Global Citizen, who has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another example of so-called "clicktivism" – creating the belief that people actually have an important impact on the situation with the signing of online petitions or the intervention of tweets?
Movement Global Citizens states that since 2011, more than 19 million "acts" of their supporters should be recorded for a range of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to make commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Earlier in 2018, the group stated that its actions were expected to result in 390 commitments and communications on the basis of which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The Group is of the opinion that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments were the Food Power (The Power of Nutrition), the partnership of investors and decision makers, committed to "help children realize their full potential" which promised the Rwandans $35 million of aid to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 rounds of movement from global citizens.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition into historical archives,” told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018 by Tracey Ulllman, Ambassador of the Power Food Partnership.
The Group also said that the Government, following over 5,000 actions, which the United Kingdom called for an improvement in the nutrition of mothers and children, had announced that it would co-finance the Food Power Project, which would achieve 5 million women and children by means of food measures.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the web site, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
the movement of the Global citizen replied: “This will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will also succeed, as we are stronger together.
Among some of the performers who will take part in this year's New York event are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a U.S. interior ministry as a “block” of Russian energy exports
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner newspaper, that Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the statutory governments) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that their presence in the Middle East is a reason for the energy market, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” I would say.
In the opinion of the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do so. The Navy will ensure that our maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, so as to prevent Russian energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of an event hosted by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group known as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, stressing that it was exactly the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic possibility is more or less the impact on fuel and the replacement thereof,” he said, with Russia calling it “a single-tricked, one-trick-based economy”.
The statements were made at a time when Trump's administration was trying to increase its natural gas exports to Europe, where Russia was expected to be undermined by a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials of Trump’s government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to renounce the “inadequate” North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is expected to be a “talec” Moscow following Trump Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth USD 11 billion, which is intended to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for implementing the pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany rejected the American position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Involvement of a third country in our energy supply means a big problem for me”, said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “research” her candidacy in the elections for the US President in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would “examine” her candidate for the US president after the midterm elections.
In a town house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider a candidate.
“It’s time to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman’s leader,” she said after reporting the newspaper The Hill.
"After the 6th of November, I will examine my candidate for the President in detail."
Warrenov, in a meeting in the city house, was beating President Donald Trump, because he was supposed to "lead this country in the wrong direction."
“What Donald Trump does to our democracy worries me terribly,” she said.
Warren and Trumpa, the president of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, have already been openly critical.
On Friday, in turn, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the elections."
The survey, published on Thursday, showed that most of its own voters felt that Warren should not compete for the presidency's position in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk Political Research Centre/Boston Globe, the senator should not be running for president, eighty-five percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-thirty percent would support her candidate.
The survey showed that the former Governor Deval Patrick has more support for the candidate, with 38 percent of respondents supporting it, and 48 percent of the respondents are expected to oppose it.
The other senior Democrats, who would come to the table for election in 2020, are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
After reporting to Associated Press, he said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin at the meeting in support of Donald Trump
After his entry into the army, Track Palin spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“My own son, who experiences his return, connects me with other families who cope with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain amount of injury that our soldiers return to,” told the audience at a meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin’s son’s arrest was described as “a elephant in a salon” and said that her son and other war veterans were returning somewhat changed, hardened, wondering where respect for what the soldiers and aircraft were and all the other members of the military donated to the State.”
Trakka Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence by assaulting a woman, obstructing the declaration of violence in the family and possession of weapons in the wine state, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasili police station.
18 federal states and the district of Colombia support the abolition of new asylum policies
Eighteen federal states and the District of Colombia support the legal rejection of a new US policy, which denies the right to asylum to victims who flee from gang violence or domestic violence.
The NBC News Agency reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district mentioned on Friday filled in a courthouse to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions, which the American Union of Civil Liberties against Federal Policy, has not been published.
She claimed that her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang” had abused her, but her request for asylum was rejected by the American authorities on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the federal states supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications in the United States come, as countries that constantly face gang problems and family violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy annulled the Committee on Invitations of Migrants, which made it possible for undetected immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said that the new policy "disappoints decades of national, federal and international law."
“The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the claim and that such a prohibition infringes this principle”, states the requested request before the Court of Justice.
Public prosecutors have further stated in the request that a policy that denies immigrants the right to enter is damaging to the American economy, as it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary labour".
The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to refrain from giving asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” said Sessiones on 11 June in his policy publication.
Asil was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day throughout the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are under way to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very intense,” said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum, as she comforted her hot boy at the evacuation center in the city of Palu.
“Salterers carry bodies all the time.
There is a lack of clean water."
It looked like a city that was returning to destroyed homes that were breaking through wet things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake were overburdened.
Some injured, including the Two Harris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, were resting outside a military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoor due to persistent severe earthquakes.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that struck the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was settled with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I was squeezed against the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press. He added that he was with his family in town because of the wedding.
"I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses Chinese "response" with "propaganda ads"
One week after the publication of the four-party advertisement of the official Chinese newspaper in the American journal, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador Beijing accused the abuse of the American press of spreading propaganda.
The American President Donald Trump mentioned the Chinese Daily’s paid allowance in the newspaper Des Moines Register — the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after China accused interference with the American Congress on 6 November, which China denies.
The U.S. federal officials, Trump, reported that Peking tried to interfere with the U.S. federal elections, described it as a new phase in Washington's increasingly intense efforts to press on China.
Although commercial advertising is common to foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently complex in an ever-increasing trade war in which they exchange duties on imports.
China's payback tariffs at the beginning of the trade war are expected to affect exporters in federal countries such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to the Chinese and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had affected American workers, farmers and companies.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, "now this harassment doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of the valued American tradition of free speech and free press for the publication of a paid advertisement in the journal Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
"On the other hand, you will see few other opinions and no real reflections on the diversity of opinions held by Chinese citizens on the worrying Chinese economic path, as the media strongly oversees the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans lose elections before intermediate elections with a break-up with Kavanaugh, advise analysts
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court, despite several allegations of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming intermediate elections with the loss of voters.
Feelings here are extremely high, and most Republicans have already said that they want to proceed with the vote.
It is not possible to return this back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University Faculty of Syracuse for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that the pressure of Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday. They won’t forget it tomorrow and even November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Counsellor and National Representative of the advanced MoveOn Group, on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang “November is coming!” when they demonstrated in the Senate hall, when Republicans who oversee the Judicial Committee decided to further support Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported the Mic news portal.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will exceed all limits," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say they're strong now, and that's true.
However, it could be even stronger, especially between unidentified voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29 who do not like the president, but do not often vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that further Republican support could have a negative impact.
“This has become a major commotion for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, reporting to NBC News at the beginning of the week.
“It is not only the vote of the Council or the final vote or Kavanaugh's vote; it is also the way that Republicans are faced with this and how Ford was treated,” said Guy Cecil, director of the Group of United States Priorities, who supports the Democrats in the elections.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided between whether to believe Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's, with a few more supporting them.
A new survey of youGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said that they believed Kavanaugh for sure or the most.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying about the testimony, and only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flakea FBA, he is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian newspaper.
Ford was sworn by the court of the Senate last week to be attacked by Kavanaugh when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her half when they were together at the party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor intends to start a new internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, opens a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Berners Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to their information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of Inrupt was to "govern the world".
“We decided to do it now”, he said about a new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses a Solid platform technology that enables the user to create a "personal storage facility" or a "ND"
This may include contact details, to-dos, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Similar to being Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal storage facility for data storage is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
This company calls it “personal data empowerment”.
Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of a company is to pool resources, processes and appropriate skills that will enable everyone to access the Solid platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group “are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether we could introduce a complete change that could end all their business models overnight.”
"We're not asking them for permission."
On Saturday’s publication on the Medium portal Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s purpose is “to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next period of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Festival of Victoria's Cross since World War I
For 100 years in their home city, they have been celebrating the granting of Victoria’s cross to the only priest of the English Church who had won it as a fighter in World War I.
Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann deserved recognition on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, a sniper shot him, so he never learned that he had been given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two colonel's grandsons discovered a monumental stone.
One of the great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after Grandpa’s act of merit.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Holy Quintina Canal on 29 September 1918 “through a very dense fog and under a strong fire of battlefields and machine guns.”
Later, he planned against the line of fire and led the line through “the greatest of heroism” and then attacked the engine room and hit three members of the squad.
On October 4, 2018 – only a good month before the end of the war – Lieutenant Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of the old father were “something I know and could never achieve, so teach me humility.”
After the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Dr. James Vann and her brother also laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this parade", and "that the bravery of the true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give."
The fans of mixed martial arts were awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they received the Puys Pepe.
Imagine: You've been up all night to watch completely sold out Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose consisted of 13 matches, including six on the main park, and was carried live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to make themselves known, viewers in the United Kingdom found that the transfer had been replaced by playing Pujs Pep's cartoon.
A lot of people weren't thrilled because he stayed up until morning just because of the fight.
One of the enthusiasts described on Twitter the switch to a child's drawing as a "some sick joke".
“In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s programme,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Bellator’s Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Pejsa Pepa. Yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule so that future viewers in the United Kingdom would also be involved.
“When I think about playing again, I think that we could arrange this,” said Coker.
"But then there's six o'clock in the morning, and we won't be able to settle this until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a number of messages were exchanged during the switch and not all were nice.
We tried to sort things out; we assumed it was only a technical mistake.
However, the real reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of the six, we will endure five fights — as usual. We tried to offer more than expectations to the fans, and we counted on that.
This is a very unthankful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about sexuality.
The Olympic Diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation he felt inferior to everyone – but this gave him motivation for success.
A 24-year-old said that "not everyone like him" was aware when he entered high school.
In his first talk on Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said that he spoke about the rights of gays in order to give others “hope”.
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics had diminished.
The regular head of a long-term show, Kirsty Young, has been absent for months.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on the first show of Laverne, said that he felt "less worthy" than everyone else, because "it was socially acceptable for us to like boys and girls."
He said: “To this day these feelings of inferiority and differentity are the real thing that gives me strength and perseverance to achieve success. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something”, he said that he would not disappoint anyone who finally found out about his orientation.
Two-time bronze Olympic contestant became a powerful advocate of LGBT-rights and twice this year appeared on the Games of Communities of Nations in Australia to call on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could speak openly without consequences and that he wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said that he was romantic with a man – American film maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "surprised."
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says that the difference in years never meant a problem.
“When you’re so young,” he said,“at the age of 14, he attended the first Olympic games, and three years later his father died,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar climbs and falls.
A couple adopted a child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says that this changed his “full view”.
“If I were asked last year, everything I would say would be “I have to reach the gold medal”, he said.
"But, you know, there are more things in the world than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Dahley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn’t tell him, “This time it won’t be the first time, Dad, ” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally admit that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive at the Olympics in front of the local audience. It was not a better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of song – the stream of music by Heather Small, which was accompanied by preparations for the Olympics and which still makes his skin gnawed.
Desert Island Discs shows at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
The unprepared Mickelson made his Saturday's Ryder Cup a seat.
The American Phil Mickelson will be playing his 47th game in Ryder's Cup on Sunday, setting a record, but he'll have to go back to form, so it won't become an unfortunate milestone.
Captain Furyk, on Saturday's Thursdays, left Captain Furyk sitting.
Instead of being at the centre of what was happening so often for the United States, the five-time winner of the day spent partly as a fan and partly on improving his game in order to correct what weighs him down.
Given that even at the peak of the career, the 48-year-old does not correspond best to the narrow Le Golf National, where the long ice inevitably penalises the missed blows.
And if only the playground wasn't scary enough, Mickeyson would be dealing with the real winner of the British Open Francescom Molinaria on the ninth day of the game this week, and he's hooked up with the new guy Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who at the beginning of the 12 games of individuals had four fewer matches, were to start well, then Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, otherwise he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, he smothered me back and hugged me with his hand and said he will be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's one of the famous ones, and he's been in the past, and he's made a remarkable contribution to the teams this week.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it worked out that way, and we felt that this should be done.
He wants to play like everyone else."
Mickelson is going to break Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the largest number of matches in the Ryder Cup Cup Cup Cup Cup.
This could mark the end of Ryder’s cup’s career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Furyk said that his presence in the team also brings some unrelenting benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make a fool of people and it’s great to have him in the team space,” he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun when they confronted him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be dropped
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the beginning of the last day of the games of individuals in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
The young Danec debuted in 1997 at a game in Valderra, where the party whose captain was the Seven Ballesteros had five points of advantage over the Americans, and the goal was to move only for hair, with a score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“Don’t forget that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Valderram where we won, but barely”, said Bjorn (in the picture) after seeing the Class of 2018 team that won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and headed to the Le Golf National field with 10-6.
So history to me and everyone on the team shows that the cup is not over.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
The race's not over until it's on the board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we need to stay focused on it.
All the time he says I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also well aware of who is standing on the opposite side – the best players in the world."
Impressed by the game of his players on a challenging playground, Bjorn added: “I would never have been too quick here.
Tomorrow's a different day.
He'll be playing in front of individuals tomorrow, so he'll have to do it differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, your golfer skills are tested to the end.
This is a message you need to pass on to the players: tomorrow you need to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind, and he too must draw the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points from four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the revolutions in the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe carried out “The Miracle in the Medina”.
“I remember every damn word,” he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the last day of the game.
"We have 12 major races tomorrow, but we would like to start as quickly as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in the Medina.
When this momentum gets endurance, it's tightly pressed to the middle game.
We created the right arrangement and put the boys in a way, until we felt we would do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the battle and confront Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"In this group of boys, I have chosen this order because I think it covers the entire schedule," Bjorn said about the choice of individuals.
The new German warship has been rescheduled
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be handed over to use in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the Cold War, but due to system failure and rapidly rising costs, local news outlets have reported.
The transfer of the Rheinland-Pfalz ship, the leading ships of the new class frigate Baden-Wuertemberg, is now translated into the first half of 2019, says Di Zeit magazine, which lists the military representative.
The vessel should join the navy in 2014, but an ambitious project raises worrying questions after delivery.
Four of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, commissioned in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen frigate class.
It is expected that they will have a strong cannon, a type of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and some technologies of concealment, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer distances between maintenance – the latest frigates should be left outside the home port by two years.
However, continuing delays mean that the supreme wars of the ships, which are supposed to enable Germany to exert its power also overseas, will become obsolete by the time of application, notes Di Ziet.
An unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the cover last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That's the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are few, and the German news reports have cited a number of key "software and technical deficiencies" that would make the warship useless if it were deployed to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuertemberg class vessels will operate a crew with about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was severely heavy, reducing its capacity and limiting the capacity of the Navy to build it up.
The 7000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfalz is expected to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – has also become a problem.
This is expected to reach EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is diminishing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy actually “restraints ships suitable for posting.”
The official said that over time the issue had become tighter because the old ships had broken down and replacement vessels had not been provided.
He regretted that no vessel from the Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new study is being carried out at the property in Scotland, in which bats seek to discover how to use food in hunting food.
They hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will be accompanied by small bats and minor bats and brown coal bats and bypass bats at the Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
Special monitors will be set up at key locations of the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the images will confirm the frequency of bat calls and what species they are doing.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour across the province.
Rob Dewar, an NTS consultant for nature conservation, hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most suitable for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the shelters and the loss of habitats.
Risks also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as flies and certain types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks of home cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But nightly hunting habits make it easier to help each other with their ears than with their eyes.
They shall use a sophisticated eco-location technique to accurately identify errors and obstacles on the flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the supply of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
He employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, remedial and occasional rescue checks.
On the territory of Threave in the area of Dumfries and Galloway, the organization has established the first and only Scottish reserve for the time being, specifically intended for bats.
The land manager, David Thompson, says the land for them is the ideal territory.
“We have an excellent area for bats in Threav,” he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
However, there is still much to be learned about bats, so the work we are doing here and on other estates will help us to understand better what they need to succeed."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on crops, as possible unwanted destruction of one of the bats' births could result in the death of up to 400 females and cubs, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass, or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their birthplaces.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish leader of the Bat Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we simply do not know how well their populations stick.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges that he was about to commit as "false news" and said that people wanted to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine with the news of Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus accused him of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay $375,000 for the silence of the event.
At the address of 142 million followers in Instagram Live Video several hours after reporting Ronaldo, 33, reported as "false news"
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was false news,” said a five-time gold ball winner in the camera.
»By using my name they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I am a happy man and I want all good," the smiling added the actor.
Ronald's lawyers, after reports from Reuters, are preparing themselves for the complaint against Der Spiegel for the charges that were referred to as “an unacceptable reporting of personal life suspicion”.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “non-monetary damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident was expected to take place in June 2009 in the apartment of the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
In the paperwork submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada, she was supposed to return to the acting room after meeting at the Mayorg Night Club with Ronald, and he was supposed to rape her anally there.
Mayorga claims that after the event, Ronaldo fell on his knees and said that he was a “99% good person” who disappointed only “one percent”.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed his sexual relationship, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police station and taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, and later arranged for an out-of-court settlement because she was “awfully afraid of revenge” and was concerned about “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement, because due to the alleged event, she continues to suffer severe trauma.
Ronaldo was moved to the Italian Grand Juventus at the time of the alleged attack just before his transition from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus, worth $100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will regret the loss of car manufacturers for all time.
The United Kingdom “would regret” if it lost the status of the world’s leading car manufacturer after the brixit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told BBC that the UK would have stopped production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby without an agreement.
“We need a deal”, said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border could lead to job losses without an agreement in the case of brilliance.
Burnaston – which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that if the UK left the European Union without an agreement at the end of March, production in our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s executive director at Burnaston’s factory.
Concerns about how leaving the European Union will have an unannounced impact on cross-border trade have also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit for a month, she would close her Mini factory in Oxford.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of brixitis.
Toyota's production line operates according to the principle of "in due time", with parts of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for cars coming on order every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, this could result in disturbances at the borders for which representatives of the industry say it could cause congestion and lack of parts.
Toyota, in its Derbyshire factory, could not harmonise for more than one day parts, representatives of the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Therese May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid such border checks".
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity”, said for the broadcast of Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The data not only of Toyota, but of other manufacturers as well, are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not comment on how long the production would have been stopped and pointed out in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Union trade union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, a lost job will never be returned."
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be moved again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could, due to the ongoing fight over the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh “rescheduled for another week”, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian pre-election interference, the connections between Trump's co-workers and Russia and the potential president's obstruction of judicial power.
The question is whether Trump will fire the Attorney General and threaten Mueller's independence has been fueling the Washington rumors for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a listening device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On the last Monday, he visited the White House in the middle of a report on his intention to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, then held at the United Nations conference in New York, was declared Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein “would rather not” forgive, and then moved the meeting to avoid a conflict by hearing the Senate’s judicial committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour, Dr Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the Senate vote.
Trump's press release, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet set for him; it could happen this week, given everything else that goes on in the Supreme Court, but it could be postponed for another week.
We will see. I always like to make sure that you are informed."
Sanders hasn't called a meeting of the White House with reporters since 10 September.
The head of the Chris Wallace show asked her why.
Sanders said that the frequency of the meetings was not attributable to the resistance to the "stand-up" of TV rapporteurs, but said: "I could not deny that they were standing up."
She then mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The President shall hold more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding without mentioning the source: “We have looked at the figures.”
The meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "If the press at the President of the United States can address their question directly, it is infinitely better than discussing with me.
This is what we are trying to make possible, and you have seen that we have done this frequently in the past few weeks and that you will have a conference at which you will be able to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with the public at guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York City, the president may have shown why, when he appeared freely and in part bizarrely in front of the press.
Letter from the EU Health Minister to the NHS Scotland regarding the fear of brixie
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to continue their work after the brixit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued, as the decision was made in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member regardless of his nationality.
College members from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie immediately operated after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Line Supporter, Christion Abercrombie, after a head injury in Saturday's defeat with 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores Bridge underwent an urgent operation, reported Mike Organ with The Tennesseean magazine.
The main coach at Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury had only occurred a little before half-time.
"He came to the edge of the playground and somehow collapsed there," said Reed.
The coaches and medical personnel provided oxygen to Abercrombie on the edge of the playground before they put him on the stretcher and took him off the playground for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was recovering after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "details of the type/range of the injury are not yet known" and that the Tennessee National University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a bruc in the university, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time after moving from University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered five strokes together before leaving the game, which raised his total number of strokes in the season to 18 strokes.
A higher fee will be charged to foreign customers when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
A higher fee will be charged to foreign customers when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to the new Tori plans
The move will neutralise Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Increased balance will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects her to collect up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of colkovin when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and the money collected will be sent to the homeless today, there will be a message from Theresa May.
The move must be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts in order to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and higher taxation for people with high incomes.
The increased balance will be charged to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and additional money will encourage government efforts to end homelessness.
A deduction — to be charged in addition to the current round, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and property for broadcasting — could be no less than three percent.
The Treasury expects to collect up to GBP 120 million per year through the introduction of the measure.
According to estimates, UK non-nationals are expected to buy 13 percent of the newly built London properties, resulting in an increase in prices and a heavier purchase of first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” as the number of customers who spend most of their time outside the country is increasing.
A new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the hip to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
The large construction companies accused price hikes by the thickening of land not actually used, and called on Mrs. Mayevo to abandon quotas for affordable housing in order to correct the British "founding shame".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and forced evictions without mistakes.
In addition, he wants to give city councils greater powers to build new homes.
“ Last year, ” said Mrs. Mayeva, “I said that I would dedicate my prime leadership to restoring British dreams — that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means the correction of our non-participating housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work here and create their lives.
It cannot be right, however, that for persons who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, buying homes is as simple as for the garrass British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to manage the Scottish Club"
Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his “final goal” once became the manager of the Scottish Club.
42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of revitalizing North-East, currently occupying third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-class.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after St Mirren in the last season again took to the Scottish Championship.
"For my country I wanted to play as an actor.
I received a B cap and this was it," Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up often observing Scotland in Hampton as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered if he were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former team chief Alloa Athletic, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, said he had never felt fear as the successor of such great names.
“Success is measured for me by the question “Can I take this club back to the First League?”
In view of the structure and capacity, this club clearly belongs to the First League,« he said.
"It's not easy to travel there, but I would probably be successful only if I could take the club there again."
Ross only worked as a manager for three years after he was assistant to the head of Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the training staff of Hearts.
Alloi then helped to prevent the outfall of the third league, and St Mirren led from the edge of the fall to the title of the championship champion in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“This was probably a real breakthrough”, recalled Alloe’s takeover.
"I was truly convinced that management is the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because I was doing a good job as an actor, and that made me a relatively good part of my life, and I also achieved some greater success.
But the game can become difficult.
There are a number of things to deal with every week.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management simply feels like the right thing to do for myself.
I have always wanted to run a club and I am doing it now. In my skin, I feel the most comfortable in my whole adult life."
You can listen to the full interview on Sunday, September 30, at the Sportsound on Radio Scotland Station between 12 and 13 pm (BST)
Research result: The perfect time for a beer is Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
Summer heat increased the revenues of hard-hit British pubs, but there was also an increase in pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The group of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business adviser who prepared the data, said: “The persistent solar weather and England’s participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as in June of the previous month, when the income of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, but that restaurants were hit even harder.
The decline in restaurant turnover by 1.8 per cent in June was still increasing in July.
Transport in pubs and bars with drinks increased in comparison more than in restaurants.
Sun weather has also reduced sales in pubs that offer mainly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
Seems people just wanted to go for a drink.
In different pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent in one month and the sale of food decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, from the free time and hospitality group of analysts, RSM said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The largest factors of weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain in the marketing of hospitality.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the decline of 4.8 per cent at the annual level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For food owners, a long hot summer could not come at a more improper time and only time will tell whether the recovery will be needed to bring the temperate temperatures we experienced in August."
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2,7 % in July, indicating the slow introduction of brands.

One of the five kids on the social network has a secret account hidden from their parents.
The study showed that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — have a secret account on the social network that they hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of false Instagram pages
News boosted fears of sex-related content publication
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account intended for parents
One of the five children - some of them are only 11 years old - creates an account on social networks that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed rapid growth of false Instagram accounts.
The news has strengthened fears of the publication of sex-related content.
Twenty percent of students said that they manage a censored “main” account that they show to parents and also have private accounts.
A mother who accidentally ran into the hidden side of her 13-year-old daughter noticed that the daughter of the visitors invited her to rape her.
A study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) showed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of which are admitted to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” of the Scottish Committee on Athletics
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Committee on Athletics as non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle has described this move as the most outstanding Scottish athlete on the ground and in the open and President Ian Beattie described it as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sports to benefit from its extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Communities. We are convinced that athletics in Scotland with its inclusion in the Committee have won enormously,” said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm delighted to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help manage sports in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals in the run at 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, remained speechless after the transient ischaemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would be time to tell if I could recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I was fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I am conducting an agility exercise!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!«
An ad for a chest pump comparing mothers with cows divided online opinions
The company producing the chest pumps divided the opinions with an ad comparing the mothers with the cows at the mall.
In order to start marketing “first silent portable chest pump” Elvie’s consumer technology company published a provocative music video ad that would show mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of a cow in a barn filled with hay, on a song that includes the following text: "Yes, I draw, but there's no tail," and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't my tits, these are my tits."
Zborček goes on to say, "Drop out, drain up, feed the babies, drain up, drain up, squeeze the breasts."
However, the advertisement published on Facebook’s website has led to considerable unbiased online.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said that they were joking about the “gross” of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they also become pregnant and grow up to produce milk, but children are stolen from them within the first days of their breeding,” wrote one.
Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
The other commented: “Of course it’s traumatic for both mothers and babies.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump for mothers who keep their children?«
Someone else added, "Advert completely without feeling."
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she thought it was a song called "breathing funny."
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it too if I still had breast-feeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it as it was meant to be.
This is a brilliant product,« wrote the second.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad targeting mothers who exhaust (often in the workplace or toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that commends or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing with hidden pumps in their bra.
The concept of action is that many women who draw breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump, however, is completely silent, has no wire or tube and fits discreetly into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, keep the child and even outdoor activities while milking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in mothers, further commented. "Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative presentation."
With the drive of parallels between women sucking milk and cows of milk, we wanted to focus attention on drawing milk and all its challenges, and in a fun way that can connect women to show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump came to the headlines.
During the London Week mode, the mother of two children on the model track walked for designer Martha Jakubowski when using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly relocated to the tent camp at the Texas border
The number of detained children of migrants has risen significantly, even if the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump’s administration have made it difficult to hand the children over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to compromise their own chances of staying in the country with a child’s request.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities reported that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to print out fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer at the Agency, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested more than ten people who had requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or domestic sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are punished foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained and not after 60 days of the previous standard, workers at the shelter said.
Many will show up with a videoconferencing call, not in person, to defend themselves against a immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to the statements made by workers in shelters and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Advocates said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, e.g. Tornilla, where signs of child distress are more likely to remain undetected because of their size.
They added that moving children into tents without being emotionally prepared or given a chance to say good - by their friends would complicate the trauma that many of them face.
Syria urges the US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moual called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
He said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would “continue to deal with them as well”.
“They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw,” he said to the congregation.
Moualem said that "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to leave their homes, "almost finished".
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy battle until we cleanse the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United Nations has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this war divided country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for them were appropriate for their return and blamed “some Western countries” for the “spreading of unreasonable fears” which convinced the refugees to remain abroad.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"They are turning into a political issue, which should be an exclusively humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive recovery funds until Asad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last important stronghold of the rebels, Idlib, created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a “clear deadline” and expressed the hope that military intervention will be directed against jihadists, including the fighters from the Nusra Front, associated with Al Qaeda, who will be “exploited”.
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon he will convene the first session of the new committee, composed of government members and opposition, to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Government of Syria for participation in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited to the review of the members of the current Constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump will reach his second term
Following this conclusion, Mr Trump will win the re-elections in 2020, unless, as is likely, many liberal viewers hope, his presidency has ended prematurely with interoperation and scandal.
Which would no doubt be "the most dramatic final of the presidency any time!"
So far, there's no sign of the fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s view has more than doubled to 1.05 million at the time of peak viewing, and MSNBC’s view has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News Channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, which was more than four years ago in Nielsen when it was 1.7 million, and the broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" on the MSNBC channel reached the largest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on nightly important news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama ‘Designed Survivors’, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned song comedy and authors »Only funny works: and some solid truths about snooping in the Club of Hollywood Boys« offers a different explanation.
It remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, “Because he makes me laugh,” Mrs Scovelle told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what appears on TV, the Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe v. Wade case, given whether immigrant families can reconnect and the health of the global economy.
The turnoff is a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the most privileged viewers.
Nevertheless, a six-hour look at the round table of experts discussing the use of the resource “out of the deep background” for Bob Woodward’s “Fear” book, $15,000 worth of new leather jackets (“the garment, thickly grounded with a bloat,” said The Washington Post), and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Trump’s, kim, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Maria again.
“The work of his work, which impresses the reality of the show, is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the “Pawn Stars” event about the meeting of Trump’s show and daily strikes scenario (divorce with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong Una).

When I spoke to Mr Fleiss this week, there were 80 degrees (26.7 °C) of sunlight outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was baffled inside when he filmed CNN.
In no way could he tear himself off, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Committee and hung the future of the Supreme Court in the air.
“I remember that we were creating all these crazy shows at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” said Mr Fleiss.
"I decided it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money runs to prepare for the narrowest intermediate parliamentary elections
It is not surprising that there is a flood of money in the 17th Pennsylvania district, as two candidates were in the same race for the same seat due to the reorganization of the congressional districts.
This has recently been the home of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the special elections this spring in the second district of Pittsburgh.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapped with the new 17th district.
The charts were redrafted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been anticipated in favour of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district touched on the fight to fund the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congress Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
The album was released on November 10, 2012 and was released on November 27, 2010.
This seat was occupied by Republican President Donald Trump for more than a decade and won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
In the United States, they were thinking about sanctions against Salvador for supporting China, and then they retreated.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a warm meeting with President Páname Juan Carlos Varelo and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the leadership of Trump's organization.
Officials of the Foreign Ministry decided to cancel US diplomatic mission leaders in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and the Panamanian Republic "the recent decision to end Taiwan's recognition", said Heather Nauert, representative of the Ministry at the beginning of the month.
However, the sanctions were considered with regard to Salvador, which is estimated to receive US$ 140 million in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a restriction on financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a significant impact on the Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
At internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the direction of the United States.
By mid-September, the top government officials had explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending their reflection on the sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now responsible to address the conference participants, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance attributed by the U.S. government to the meeting, has been added to diplomats.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them under the condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government and has also spoken about it under the condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be Robert Mueller's Special Adviser's report on the possible obstruction of the judiciary, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also intended to direct the investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved with Russia in an attack on the American elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to respond to this authority and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues at the very moment he is preparing to speak to his constituents again.
There are a lot of questions and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long a fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed to miss the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
At such milestones, the flow of history changes and accelerates or inhibits the unscrupulous march of democracy.
The Americans are facing more than one such breakthrough right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this journal reported that last year he proposed a covert recording of the president and speculated about his inadequacy to this situation.
Mr Rosenstein said the report of The Times was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the requested investigation by the FBI of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and guilty testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a congress that will require Mr Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, we will face a long winter democracy.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and told me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the sneakers.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?«

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that they will win over Austria after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, putting them in a convincing position for the qualifications of the Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented a connective player named Graham Dorrans from first showing up before the 2:2 draw against Villarreal in the season, but he believes that the Rangers can use this as a deduction for greater achievements.
"This was a worthy point for us because Villarreal is a strong team," said a 31-year-old.
"We entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point.
You might end up winning, but in general, remi is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a hard game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but with a crowd for us, I am convinced that we can do our best and achieve a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place right now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
The poor sleep of women for fear of savings
Although respondents had a clear idea of how they should be cared for, few people spoke to their family members about it.
Half of the respondents to the survey of the insurance company Nationwide said that the spouses were talking to them about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they were talking to their children about it.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but do not try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life Insurance Sector of Nationwide.
You can start next time.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your families to take care of you if you don't talk to her about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, since this can be an important factor in the assessment of the cost.
Include financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs or self-insurance by own resources if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the time of transition.
Choose a medical representative to determine the trustworthy person who will supervise your health care and ensure that experts respect your medical wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the authority of a person for his or her finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so on your own.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?

earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of victims was expected to increase further.
When communication was interrupted, rescue workers from the Donggal Regent, areas north of Palu, near the epicentre of the Magnitude earthquake, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake in Palu.
Some key information on Palu and Donggali in Swaziland:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavesia, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulaveza and is estimated to have 3,79,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The town celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a landscape stretching along 300 km (180 miles) of coast along the northwest of the island of Sulavezi.
The Regents, an administrative unit under the province, were estimated at 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Swaziland are aquaculture and farming, especially in the central region of Donggala.
In the province, nickel mining is also an important activity, but mostly in Morvalje, on the other side of the Sulavesija.
Palu and Donggalo have repeatedly affected tsunamis in the last 100 years, following the reporting of the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, the tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 the tsunami also hit northern Donggalo and caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia sits on the earthquake active Tihoocean fire ring and earthquakes occur regularly here.
In recent years some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian assessment, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The type of severe earthquakes affected the West Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 affected the southern part of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and caused the death of almost 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of Magnitude 7.6 occurred near Padang, the capital city of West Sumtra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 affected one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: The Paddy Jay Regent in Aceh was affected by the earthquake and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami did not start, but the buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes have affected the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused the death of more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily held thousands of tourists.
Arresting Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governors and vice-presidents Sarah Palin, were arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old woman from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, obstructing family violence and resisting arrest, reported to the Alaska State Troopers police agency on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin was an acquaintance when he tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took his phone out of his hands.
The fuel was detained at Mat-Su Prefecture and reported by the KTU network in custody under an uninsured guarantee of $500.
He appeared at the courthouse on Saturday, where he spoke of a "probably open" when he was asked about the motion, the network reported.
The fuel was charged with three Class A offences, which means that it could be closed up to one year and punished with a fine of USD 250,000.
He was also charged with one class B offence punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time he's charged with a felony.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran Court.
On January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by the veteran groups when her son’s violent behavior was linked to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning to the military service in Iraq.
tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died following an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Swaziland on Friday.
The 7,5 magnitude earthquake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are being cut off and the death toll is expected to increase further in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just outside the central Swaziland, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Video clips that show the moment of the earthquake are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the beach, there were hundreds of people on the beach at the festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saiful Saip, a suspect for a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died. This is a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was supposed to use a rental truck to carry out a bicycle attack along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan when he hit several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that the Saips “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, it is recorded in the notice of the death penalty application lodged in the South District of New York.
According to the court's file, any of the charges may be the cause of the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury of Saip was briefed by the defendant in 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder in aid of extortion used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “significant planning and slander,” said the prosecutors, who described the way of Saip as“a shameful, cruel and depraved”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drak, Ariel Erli, Herna Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccoa,” states the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the Southern District handed down the last death penalty ten years ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, and finally in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty was last imposed in New York City in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed for the conspiracy of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, Uzbek citizen, in the days and months following the attack, did not show any regret, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by ISIS video clips that he had seen on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said that he had requested the disassembly of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
On 22 counts, he pleaded inconclusive.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “evidently disappointed” by the decision of the prosecution.
"We do not believe that the death penalty decision, rather than accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved, will only prolong the suffering related to these events," Patton said.
The Saip Defence Group had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
NIGELA FARAGEA, a Turkish MP, should be in charge of the negotiations on the brixite.
In today's protest at the Tori conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army".
Former Ukipa leader said that politicians must "feel hot" Eurosceptics when one of their own Members suggested that they should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Bone said on a hike in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if he were Mr Farage's secretary of brissit.
However, the challenge facing Mrs. Mayev in coordinating his deeply divided species was further highlighted by the Tori, who favored the resignation of brexito, who joined a separate protest against brexite in the city.
The Prime Minister is working to keep his plan in track during the crackdown on the supporters of brexita, the opponents of brexita and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva in Brussels will try to reach an agreement despite opposition and to force Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between its package and its “caoso”.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Department means departure) in Solihulu to "want to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as an interlocutor and assign him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, he would have been out by now," he said.
This fellow from Wellingborough added: "I will support the cry, but we must get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU with the following words: “In the world wars, we have not fought to be servants now.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed and want to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic."
The meeting was also attended by the thoria breexitarian Andrea Jenkyns, who said to the rapporteurs: “I simply say, ‘ Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular for the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular for our client and our activists, who are active in the streets and will lead us to elections at all.
Please leave Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. Mayeve, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be given "feel the heat" if they intend to issue a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray me, and today we've gathered to tell them, "We won't let you do this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I wish that the political class, which is at the edge of the betrayal of brixite, should let you feel the heat.”
"We are mobilising the people's army of this country, which has provided us with the victory of brexite, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remainers walked through Birmingham, where they then held a double meeting in the city center.
After the formation of the group, a handful of activists waved off this weekend with the Tori flag against the brigs.
The Labour noble Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security problems of using the client's application after the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the margin-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a perfect farce.
There is no such thing as a good peach,” he added.
Warren's possible negotiation for the President's position will “extensively examine”
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "co-operation in the race for the presidency will study closely" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will compete with Republican Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016 to re-election.
It is at the heart of speculation to cope with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of "town hall", since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked if she intended to compete for the chair.
Warren replied that it is time that "the women's pride in Washington and repair our corrupt government, which demands a woman on top."
Arrested after death of LSU Sims in shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that they arrested a suspect on Friday to shoot LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The Baton Roug police station reported on the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 p.m. in East Time.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help to identify the man on the tape.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday, near campus of South University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head shot and died as a result of it,” said Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul, a network of 247 sports reported to the media.
Wayde interfered to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene of the incident that he had a weapon and that he had shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department police station.
Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Roug, played 32 games with 10 beginnings in the last season, averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps to the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world champion's address, and the team ordered him to give the victory to Sebastian Vettlu
On Saturday it became the moment that Valtteri Boltas qualified for Lewis Hamilton, it is clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong influence on the race".
Bottas had a good start at the start and almost left Hamilton on dry ground when he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettla to attack his valiant colleague.
Vettel took him to boxing first and let Hamilton drive to the traffic queue, which should be decisive.
He took Mercedes into boxing later and left him behind for Vettlo, but Hamilton, after some driving actions, noticed that the Ferrari driver's reluctance to leave the inside open and risked his two defensive moves in the third corner being lagging behind.
Max Verstappen started off with the last series of nets and was on his 21st birthday in seventh place by the end of the first round.
Then, most of the race was driven without changing the tires, as he intended to perform a quick finish, ahead of Kimi Raikkonen and take the fourth place.
He finally drove into boxing in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight circles he was unable to increase speed, so the fourth city occupied Raikkonen.
It's been a tough day, because Valtteri's been driving fantastically all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he left me by.
The team did a really remarkable job to reach the first and second places,” said Hamilton.
It was really bad body talk.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senators Diana Feinstein at the meeting on Saturday for her insistence that she did not disclose the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate Investigation Commission, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate appears to be “evil, corrupt and false”.
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days, which we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,” he said.
"When you look at publications and revelations, people say, "No, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Remember her answer... you revealed the document – "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not revealed it.”
Okay, hold on a second.
We revealed it to me... No, we didn't," he added with regard to the impression of a senator.
Forda sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was disclosed in early September — but Feinstein denied that it had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr Ford’s accusation, and I didn’t disclose her letter,” she told the committee, according to The Hill Feinstein’s newspaper.
"She asked me for confidentiality, and I kept him confidential as she asked."
Her denial apparently did not correspond to the president who said at the meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, it was a really bad talk of the body.
It may not be, but it was the worst body talk I've ever seen."
In defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behaviour, the President suggested that the Democrats abuse the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
You have seen evil, abominations, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to run to break through to power and control," the president said after reporting the Mediate website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer killed two goals for the giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars were redeemed for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants with a win at a Saturday's match in Dundee at 5:3.
The Giants spoke earlier of two goals at the scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie both made it to the home side, and then Dwyer got to the Giants once again.
Francois Bouchard tied up for Dundees before the two naked Lundvald Nielsen gave them victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee from 2:1 on Friday night in the background.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, winning the Giants in the last three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the game in the fourth minute with 3:35 at the assistant of Kendall McFaul, Beauville, who scored four minutes later, and awarded David Rutherford.
In the intensive introductory part, Sullivan again played the game home side at 13:10 p.m. and handed it to Cenija for equalization at 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer took care of the giants' leadership in the break when he won his second goal at the end of the first third.
The home side was gathered together again, and Bouchard made the rest up with a strong goal at 27:37 p.m.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen lead the Dundees at the end of the second third and took advantage of the victory with the fifth goal of his team half-time and took care of the victory with the fifth goal of his team in half of the last third.
The Giants, who now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game on Friday home in Milton Keynes.
Air Traffic controller has allowed hundreds of people on board to escape the earthquake by his death
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as a hero after sacrificing their lives that a plane with hundreds of people could safely take off.
On Friday’s earthquake on the island of Sulaveza, followed by tsunami, more than 800 people died, and many are missing.
The area continues to be stressed by strong earthquake sleds, and many people are trapped in the ruins of Palu.
Although the co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthónius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a very crowded control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought he was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Representative Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian Media House ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to take him to a major hospital in another city from Balicappan to Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We have a heart market when we hear it,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach several thousand, as the State Disaster Relief Agency said that access to the cities in Donggali, Sigi and Boutonga was limited.
"The number of dead is expected to increase further, as there were numerous bodies under the rubble, and many could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, a representative of the agency.
Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been devastated by waves up to six metres high.
Military and commercial planes provide assistance and care.
Risa Kusum, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a life-saving vehicle brings the bodies.
There's no clear water.
Minimarkets are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Pala and addressed the national army: “I ask you all to work night and day to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?« According to CNN reporting.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombo, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini Air Company now says that one person is missing after crashing the plane in the lagoon
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one person was missing after the initial announcement that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the diving aircraft.
Air Niugini stated on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
In the case of an airline, they said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
They did not immediately respond to a call for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said they took seven people to the hospital on Friday.
At the airline, it was reported that there were eight passengers in stable condition in the hospital on Saturday.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just outside the track.
Some of the witnesses said the plane missed the gun.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down very low.
“This is extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that along with other passengers, he managed to break through the streaming water to the emergency exits on a diving plane.
He said the stewardess was panicking and screaming, and he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that they also jumped to the rescue, and the sailors who were in the vicinity repairing the flood. They helped themselves with the use of an inflatable boat, which carried people to the mainland before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in the past two decades in air accidents in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident that occurred to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of the night when the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in a retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers had been with her on the night before her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers's when he said he was with a friend of Michael Sanford's, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he had been in Sanford's truck that night, he said that he was "lying because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
Another incompatibility was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
A video on a cell phone shows that you only met for a week.
Rowlett said that in the time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defence is supposed to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the jury was to judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hiphop?
Hiphop Trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group from Bristol claims that Hiphop has distanced himself from the original political and social engagement.
They want to return to his roots and remake the conscious hiphop popular.
In the United Kingdom, artists such as The Fugees and Commons recently experienced a resurgence with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York nanny sues a couple because they fired her for a "racist" message.
The New York babysitter is suing a couple because they discriminated against her after receiving the wrong message from her mother who complained that she was "another black woman."
A couple deny racist behavior, and the lawsuit compares to "rape."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when she realized that she was black when the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived.
Ms Plasco-Flaxmanov wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to a man, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
Following the finding of her slip, Plasco-Flaxmanov, who felt "necessary", fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, was doing a bad job, wanted to hire Filipino, was reporting New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she was sent home with Uber.
Maurice now requests compensation from a couple in court in the amount of USD 350 per day for a period of six months to carry out the work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, such things are not done,” she said about the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the charges of racism by claiming that the release of Maurice was reasonable, for they feared that they would no longer be able to confide in her after being offended.
"The wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
"We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told him about the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone to whom you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
In comparison with the “immigration” lawsuit, Plasco said that his wife had only given birth to the child two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
"You're going to get over someone like this?
This is not very nice," he added to the investment banker.
Although the proceedings are still pending before the court, the Court of Public Opinions on social networks was quick to condemn his behaviour and way of thinking.
The publishers of the story of Paddington bear were afraid that readers would not be associated with a speaking bear, a new letter was revealed.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It was hard to put into the skin of someone who had read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to find out this now that Paddington has become an outstanding success."
She said that her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a book about a small bear toy, would be disgusted when he refused his work, and added that after his death last year was the 60th anniversary of the book "grenko-sweet".
With regard to Paddington's bear, described as a “very important member of our family”, she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“There was a quiet man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You are proud of him, even though you are not doing it yourself.
I believe that in the success of the Paddington bear, he looked in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, success was always attributed to Paddington's bear to himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
At the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried for nothing to preserve her life.
“Over called regularly to say that she felt really bad that she did not expect this to happen,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad, and he told me that in the next two minutes she would die, and I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to her by doctors to continue pumping her heart slowly absorbed and left her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to endure."
Finally, Ms. Ednan Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the test she was undergoing.
“No one knew,” she said.
"I had a bowed head and tears flowed through my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this intense feeling of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Disturbing women's beautiful posters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one to suicide try to discourage others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh bridge are beautiful posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers to which people can turn for support.
Mrs Tyler's son was 13 years old when he got depressed, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want to feel like I’m doing every day for any parent,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated every room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was “in a truly dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a relative when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made posters, “to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even when it comes to friends.
Do not sit quietly – you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was completely grounded. When the children opened gifts, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
She said that his death was a serious trauma to them, but they had to process it: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She ripped us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs at the start of the FBI investigation in the air.
“I have decided that if we can actually carry out what he asked for – after the duration and scope of a limited investigation, this may simplify us,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would be in fear of the tightening of the “breakdown”.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
Until the mid-term elections, which will take place on 6 November, it is only five more weeks – if Republicans are expected to be badly cut off, they will be severely weakened by the attempt to elect the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly telephoned senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and whom he introduced to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI reports?
The Senate, currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh in the Chamber can gather at least 50 votes, which would bring Mike Pence, vice president, a breakthrough from the position and election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased below Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un arrived in power seven years ago, said a South Korean MP.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Association, said that 1,127 people had escaped last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the key factors in stricter border control between North Korea and China were the increase in the price demanded by human smugglers.
Pjongjang has not yet made a public comment on this.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area between both Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forced to repatriate them.
The relationship between North and South – which is technically still in war – has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongjan in talks focusing on the ongoing negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Jong attributed the arrest to US sanctions since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be disarmed unilaterally,” said Mr. Ri, in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Ms. Nancy Pelosi described Brett Kavanaugh as “hysteric” and said that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The Minor Leader of Nancy Pelosi’s House of Representatives has appointed Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical” and has said that he is technically unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosija thus performed on Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anyone else as if a woman, if they did so, as ‘hysterical’,” Kavanaugh’s Thursday testimony to the Senate investigation committee commented on Pelosiev.
Kavanaugh denied the charges of sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were still teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he almost yelled and choked on his family and high school years.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the Commission and described the charges against himself as “a grotesque and coordinated mess,” organised by the liberals, angry because Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 in the presidential elections.
Pelosiev said that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony had proved that he should not be appointed as the Supreme Judge, as it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
“I believe that, with such statements and the manner in which Clinton and Democrats handled it, he was discredited,” she said.
Pelosija is on the question of whether she will try to press a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and the Democrats will get the majority in the House of Representatives for a moment.
“I will say this way — if the Congress or the FBI are not telling the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court in which he is now,” Pelosiev said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosija said that she was concerned as a Democrat about a possible Kavanaugh decision against the Law on Access to Health Care or the Roe case against Wade, since she was considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to go to court by a hysterical, biased person and expected us to say, ‘Is this not wonderful?’, said Pelosiev.
And a woman needs to cheer him up.
It's a righteous outburst after months and years of rage, and it can't express it without crying.
“We’re jockeying when we’re angry,” she told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's very rare, do you?"
She continued: “A woman who was also a director who was crying when she was angry, but she developed the technique, which was when she became angry and started crying to the person she was talking to, said, ‘Maybe I feel sad because I am crying.
I am angry.’
And then she just kept going.
I found this to be the greatest."
Tears are partly allowed to go out for anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my most powerful memories of an early career when I was working in an office where men dominated, and I once found myself crying in an unspeakable rage, is the event when an elderly woman grabbed my neck, a cold leader who was always a bit afraid of dragging me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
"They won't understand that you're mad.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they've touched you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a fence in a boat named Monkey Business and he had to step out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder found that there was no reason why she could not run for president herself.
“This was not a well thought-out decision,” she said 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the game, and another was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone then called the game “Snowling and Seven Stickes”.
Since the campaign was last joined, it was lagging behind in fundraising, so she decided not to join the game unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
“Do they think I would get a discount?” she asked.
When the conversation said that she would not start an official campaign, her emotions — the gratitude of the people who supported her — were dissatisfied with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and direct herself to the voters instead of the delegates, and anger over sexism — were so overcome that she began to suffocate.
"We'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder recalled the media reactions.
"We would think that my official sponsor is Cleenex.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone.
“Was she crying?”
How the war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The initial trade wars between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle was not over long ago, experts say that the division between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new 200 billion USD (150 billion GBP) tariffs, which effectively means taxation of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Peking has been retaliated every time with equivalent repayable measures, finally with tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent per U.S. goods of USD 60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to making eye contact with the United States, and will probably not blink soon.
In order for Washington to give up, China should agree to its demands, but the US's public disdain for Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too shameful.
However, experts say that if Beijing knew how to pull the right moves, the US pressure in the trade war could have a long-term positive effect on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic upheaval in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an expert worker who focuses on Asia at the Center's brain trust for new American security.
Syria is “ready” to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for assistance in rebuilding the country devastated in more than seven years of the ongoing war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to decontaminate the areas that terrorists have destroyed in order to restore normal conditions.
All conditions are now met for refugees to return voluntarily to the country, who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the 2011 war.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe won the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National Course in Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won Ryder's Cup since 1993.
Europe won the crown once again when the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most championships, knocked the ball into the water at the 16th hole in the par-3 game in his initial hit, which made him have to hand the game over to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined through all circles and became one of the four players who at any time since the beginning of the championship in the present form in 1979 achieved a 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spith beat the lowest-ranking European team player Thorbjorn Oleseen from Denmark with 5 and 4.
The world's best-ranking actor, Dustin Johnson, lost with 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in Ryder's Cup last time.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spanec Sergio Garcia, with 25.5 points, became the most victorious European player at the championship of all time.
"I don't normally cry, but I can't help myself today.
It was hard this year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing in me.
So happy, I'm so happy we won the Cup again.
It is a team, and I am really glad that I could help," said Garcia emotionally after a European win.
The record is handed over to John Ram, who won the American legend of golf Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1 in the games of individuals.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to beat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his game,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France to them, and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 big titles right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent a week trying helplessly to find the right way, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at high level throughout the entire championship.
After a bad performance for his team, the U.S. captain said, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we put a little pressure on Europe for a moment.
We failed.
A hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll have to get back together, I'll work with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I really like these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Drop down.
They've played us."
