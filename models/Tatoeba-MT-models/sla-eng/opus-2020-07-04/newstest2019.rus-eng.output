Name of the number ready to be shipped to Donbass of recruits from Ukraine
An official of the People ' s Police of the self-proclaimed People ' s Republic of Lugan (LNR) Andrey Maročko stated that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbass in the winter of 2018-2019.
According to him, Kiev is thus planning to “always pre-compilate units”.
“The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to perform the service in the ranks of Ukraine's Air Force, mass dismissals have led to the low staffing of units”, said Maročko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
It also did not rule out that real figures for Ukrainians in the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorism operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a combined force (OSO).
This measure was expected to enhance the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass increased as a result of the murder of the head of the DNR, Alexander Zahharchenko.
The DDR authorities have identified what happened as a terrorist attack.
During the criminal investigation, several persons involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that Ukrainian intelligence services had organized the diversion.
The U.S. authorities forced the Mask to resign as Chairman of the Tesla Board.
American businessman Ilon Musk will leave the post of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla, at the request of the U.S. authorities.
In order to resolve the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the enterprise will also pay $20 million to the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
According to CNBC, pre-trial arrangements with the department allow Maska to remain in the management office in Tesla.
In doing so, he is obliged to pay $20 million and to leave the post of Chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days of the agreement and at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed to his seat.
It is stated that the agreement should still be approved by the court.
On 28 September, it became known that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Mask of misleading shareholders of having enough funds to buy the company's shares and had sued the entrepreneur.
It's about a businessman's Twitter publication, where he said he wanted to buy Tesla's $420 shares for something, but he never did.
After Twitter, the company grew by almost 11%.
Head of British MIDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of seizing the member countries of the community.
A diplomat made such a statement at the meeting of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was established to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave will not be reduced but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity," said the Minister.
He also added that trying to punish Britain for a decision to withdraw from the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, noted Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May stated that the Brexit talks had stalled.
She thus commented on the outcome of the informal summit of the EU in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was taken in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact once London leaves the community.
Furthermore, the Irish border issue remains open.

The users of iPhone complained about problems in the Telegram Messenger after an update on 28 September.
User's phone number can be found on his Yuzerem
Complaints relate to midgets with the current iOS operating system 12.
According to their owners, after updating the app, the white screen is shown or immediately closed.
The messengers responded to the failure.
They said that migration of information to a new Swift application could be a problem.
In Telegram, automatic updating of the application was temporarily suspended until the failure was resolved.
On 13 April, the Tagan court of Moscow granted the Rossomnadzor's request for the blocking of Massenger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the communication operators proceeded to implement the decision.
The reason was that the Massier Administration had refused to provide the FSB with the key to decipher the correspondence needed to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile telephone number of the suspected terrorist user in obtaining the relevant court decision.
Telegram's auditorium decreased by 1.2 million after the blockade in the Russian Federation.

Ilon Musk is forced to resign as head of the Tesla Board.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Mask settled their case of fraud.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the television channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Masku will have to leave the head of the Tesla Board.
In doing so, the Commission allowed Maska to maintain the post of Head of Tesla.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be recovered from Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur on the list of the 50 richest people on the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX Space Corporation, the Neurotechnology company Neuralink and the Tesla electrician, as well as Paypal co-founder.
The U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission had previously sued the Director General of Tesla Ilon Mask because of his tweeting about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Masq announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy out all stock at a fixed price stock exchange at $420.
The value of the shares in $420 has been identified as “due to the significance of this number in the marijuana culture” previously reported to Bloomberg with reference to the head of the security department of the Steven Peykin Commission.
In doing so, Ilon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy out the shares.
Commenting on the case against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States, the businessman stated that he considered the charges against fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and grieved by these claims.
"Fairliness is the most important thing in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not broken it in any way," said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, the group of shareholders of Tesla filed a collective action against the Mask, complaining of the financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessmen's posts had lost them.
In particular, one shareholder stated that the businessman's tweets were misleading, which forced Tesla's stock sellers to purchase paper at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that Ilon Mask's careless remarks led to a sharp fluctuation in the course.
In September, Ilona Mask also accused the head of the research company Citron Research in the stock exchange.
In the meantime, if Masq could not settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be at risk of being removed from the management of the company and even the prison.
In particular, CNBC was declared a former chairman of the Harvey Pitt Commission.
Mask is a good guy who can't drive a car company.

Metropolitan Volokolomsky Ilarion - the causes of the conflict with Constantinople Patriarchate, possible church division and its political subtext
According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage”, the name of the church is as if in Fascist Germany, “the Jews were to attach the yellow six-edged star”.
“It means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill has been established”, said the representative of the RCC on the television channel Russia 24.
Mitropoly also stressed that UPC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, because “the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country”.
OPC called on the Constantinople Exzarcs to leave its territory

That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing a plan of action to improve the efficiency of Sochi Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.

On September 30, 1928, which was 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought the Fleming world glory and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, separating penicillin from mold mushrooms was not the first discovery of Fleming.
A few years earlier, he, being modest, sowed mucus from his own nose on a Petri cup (this is a glass roof in which he experiences bacteria) and found that the bacteria there had been destroyed a few days later.
In fact, penicillin was found to be just as accidental.
The name Fleming has been added to the list of the 100 most outstanding individuals in the history of mankind.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
Penicillin has begun to deal with most of the ancient diseases previously considered incurable, tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When Fleming came to the French capital in 1945 shortly after the Nobel Prize was won, the Paris newspaper wrote: “For the defeat of fascism and liberation of France he did more than a dozen divisions.”

By the way, this very interesting painting work, I think, was found at the same time in Madrid, but at other times, it's not about that at all.

Trump told us about "loveliness" in Kim Chen Yin.
From mutual cruelty, the U.S. leaders and the DPRK have hardly come to love each other, fooled Donald Trump.
President Donald Trump of the United States noted his success on the front of the North Korean crisis.
With mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now rectified so much that they are hardly in love with each other, the American President said.
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as a major challenge in foreign policy.
Tramp noted that Barack Obama's team had been so liaising with the DPRK that it could not even reach the country's leadership that they simply didn't take off the phone.
At that time, the United States and the DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes in the White House “fine letters” said Trump.
Trump admitted that, at the beginning of his work, he too “was cruel” to Kim Chen Yin, which, by the way, was mutual.
But now their relationship is so intense that leaders “fall in love with each other. ”
At the same time, Trump asked him not to take his words literally and warned that the American media interpreted them as incompetence.
The Trump pointed out that in recent years, Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests and has closed the military ranges.
All of this is due to the work of his administration, I'm sure the American President.
Donald Trump addressed Kim Chen Eine from the UN rostrum of the UN Genassemble last Tuesday.

At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

Nice called for “Moscow language with Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian children's writer and native language fighter Larissa Nitza called for the removal from Ukraine of “Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language”.
To do so, she offers a Ukrainian product, “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
Nice shared her views on the “objectives of the eradication of Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian edition of “Researcher”.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is already and is continuing to grow.
In time, Ukrainians “recover” from this Moscow language, she is convinced.
In neighbouring Poland, for example, she said that Russian speech had been widely used on television and radio before, but there was little left in public space.
In the opinion of Nice, however, the Ukrainians did not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian were, in her view, merely “extension of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Nice had previously shared her experience in maintaining the “Ukraine Language regime” at a children ' s camp in Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened with a network of Watsons bookshops by court, one of which was held in Russian.
When she didn't get her way, she threw her hand at a girl.
The use of Russian words by the Ukrainians is called a language schizophrenia, urging Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in writing names.
Nice recently said that the name “Russia” had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The author's anger could not escape even the Ukrainian Security Service: by coming in there and listening to the staff talk in Russian, she committed a scandal and left, knocking the door.

How did he feel today?"
"If it lasted 90 minutes, then it's all right!
Actually, he was feeling good.
Maybe at the end, a little bit of force to make sure nothing happens.
Yes, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolev Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What do you say to the team's atmosphere?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after winning and recovering, it's easier and a good mood in the group.
Now we've got a white belt, though it was black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice in the storks."
"Worded about the game of the time that I didn't go out?"
"There's a little bit of a miss because indeed, the unpleasant situation has come up.
But I'll say again, thanks to the physical therapist and the doctors for putting them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and cheered the fans.
The rest of it is secondary."

In the referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents of violations of electoral legislation were recorded in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on a name change.
A press secretary from the Ministry of the Interior, Tony Angelovsky, reported on this Sunday.
Since the opening of polling stations, four incidents have been recorded, he said.

We call on citizens to abide by the laws and to refrain from any disturbance of public order and calm and any violation of the secret vote," said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Citizens were asked to answer one question during Sunday's referendum: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece regarding the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The Heads of the Ministry of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on a new official name for the former Yugoslav Republic on 17 June at a ceremonial ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, along the border between the two countries.

The prosecution for the Dagestan MP has become news.
The Soviet District Court of Machacala detained a member of the Dagestan Rajab Abdulatipov People's Assembly for two months, suspected of participating in a criminal community that was responsible for disability for bribery.
"U" became aware of the details of the investigations that shed light on how, on the basis of the Russian Investigation Committee, the younger brother of the former Head of the Republic of Ramadan Abdulatipova Rajab Abdulatipipip contributed to the criminal activity of the former head of the Medical and Social Bureau of the Medical and Medical Review of Magomed Mahachev and his associates.
Among other things, the intelligence activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs found that Rajab Abdullahipov had been lobbying for the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as head of the Bureau, allegedly receiving $70 million.
Recall, previously, the criminal proceedings against Magomed Mahachev, other leaders and staff of the territorial medical and social bureaux under his authority have been initiated in respect of article 210 (the creation and participation of a criminal community using office), article 290 (the receipt of a bribe by an organized group), article 292 (the service floor) and article 159 (the special-scale fraud) of the Criminal Code.
As evidenced by the investigation, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipip, aware of the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his associates involved in the theft of the Pension Fund, joined in their activities by entering the criminal community.
On his post as Head of the Federal Migration Service of Russia for Dagestan and in liaison with the authorities of the State and law enforcement structures, and on his relations with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, the investigators considered that he “provided the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with officials of the public authorities to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his presence as head of the Federal Penal Institution “The Chief Bureau for Medical and Social Expertise in the Republic of Dagestan”, organized the illegal establishment of disability for citizens”.
Following the announcement of these allegations at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdullahipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, all that I'm being charged with today is for me all this new stuff, I'm completely not familiar with it," he said.
The Court arrested a member of the United Republic of Russia not ten days before the charges were brought, as was the case with the previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but immediately for two months, since the case contained article 210 of the Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time to charge the investigation, up to 45 days from the time of detention.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia was virtually absent.
The head of the Committee of the Federation for International Affairs Council, Konstantin Kosachev, considered the 73rd session of the UN Genas Assembly to be successful for Russia and did not rule out its ability to become a turning point in the perception of the RF as an integral participant in the solution to global global problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have almost become accustomed to in recent years in relation to Russia has now been more subdued”, said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes “designated one of the three major threats to humanity, along with Ebola fever, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, in any case, in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which was quite unanimous in this regard”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, “the theme of Russia was practically missing”.
“If I carefully analyze the statement made by the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not now taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, people were not exactly sure”, said the politician, noting that Russia “was no bigger than a wall that was trained by the tennis ball.”
The Head of the Sowfed Profile Committee does not rule out that this indicates a trend that he believes will “devote the current session [UN Genas Assembly], although this trend may occur in a year or two, three to the full extent”.
“I do not rule out that the current session may be a turning point in some sense”, Kosachev admitted, explaining that “there are so many examples of how with Russia joining forward in international affairs”.
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be demanded over time," added the parliamentarian.
This is due to the view that there is a “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible, inherent participant in addressing the global problems of modernity”.
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we're going somewhere where the movement is not going back, it's going to be moving forward," he added.
In this context, Kosachev referred to another “interesting and important feeling” as “the request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
"I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the Genassemblai session] of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, and I was delighted to see that, if only a year or two or five years ago, Russian opinion, a Russian vision of the world's happening, was by far no means interested, the situation now stands the same," said the Chairman of the Sowfed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “there is no answer to the question of how to address the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problem of migration”.
“And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming increasingly evident”, Kosachev said confident, stressing that in this sense he considers the “present session to be a good work for the Russian delegation, which is good for Russia”.

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idliba
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said head Walid Muallem of the Syrian Arab Republic.
In his view, Syria has the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of decommissioning fighters banned in Russia by Jebhat Al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports RIA Novosti.
The head of the MIDA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to military solutions to the problem of the territories east of Euphrates in the event of a Kurdish desire for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they broke up because of the US.
On 17 September, Putin and the President of Turkey, Recep Erdogan, agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and the Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.
Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.

According to RT with reference to Mirror, John Terry, the former captain of England's team, led the Chelsea Youth Team.
According to the source, a well-known player who has long been a member of the London Club will lead the team for no more than 23 years.

The first Deputy Speaker of the Supreme Council, Irina Geraschenko, apologized to the RF convicts for the “spionage” of Ukrainian journalist Roman Suschenko for not being able to release him from the curtains so far.
She said so in a video on the political lock-down on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Suschenko FSB.
She said that these days, under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, an action was taking place, and the participants announced a hunger protest demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, there are and well-known people, starving, supporting Oleg Sentzov, other politicized Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interview where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us did not require pressure on the Kremlin, put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of Kremlin and those who are being illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea," Geraschenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the trials would rock every Ukrainian, making us “bad, hard to protect the national interests of Ukraine, to protect each Ukrainian, to understand what is good and what is bad”.
Recall that Ukrinform's correspondent in France, Roman Suschenko, was detained by Russian forces on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage with the General Intelligence Directorate of Mineborn Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Suschenko to 12 years of the strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia found the verdict lawful.
The Russian prisoners granted the Ukrainian last request before he entered the colony.
NASA reported an asteroid-sized approach to Earth with Big-Ben
The American Space Agency NASA reported that a large SP1 asteroid is approaching the Earth, which can reach 160 m long.
According to Daily Express, the length of a space object may exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or London wheel of observation.
However, there are no accurate data on its size.
The speed at which SP1 is moving is about 60,000 km/h. The smallest distance between asteroid and Earth will be 3 October.
It will then pass by our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
Asteroid was first observed on 19 September.
NASA assigned him to nearby facilities.
Earlier, on 27 September, the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency published the first video from the surface of the asteroid Rugu.
Two Japanese cruisers (platinums) launched from Hayabusa-2 probe managed to obtain unique footage.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon."
Wahtang Kikabidze cancer
Many artists are now discussing how they have managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, spares no one, but the stories of popular people winning cancer, gives hope to many sick people.
A prominent actor, Wahtan Kikabidze, admitted that he lived only because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a severe sentence.
"I feel like I was hit on the skull with a hammer underneath.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
They put it in the hospital.
There the spoon couldn't hold, couldn't stand, fell all the time.
We started doing blood tests, it turned out bad, and the artery didn't skip blood.
They brought me to Moscow, and they said that I had a big dung cyst in my head, and they had an operation.
And during the surgery, the doctors saw the tumor for the cyst," said Kikabidze in the Ones program.
The tumor's been mutilated.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say good - bye to the king on the threshold of his home.
But the actress’s wife did not allow a living actor to be buried, and she believed that she could cope with the illness, and she did not leave her beloved spouse’s bed for over a year.
If it weren't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had critical situations, it was as close as a rock," the actor admitted.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he is happily living in his home in downtown Tbilisi.
And from time to time, he rejects the rumors of his illness, and of the timeless end which things appear in the Network.
The creators of the site Peacemaker were introduced into the section “Purity” by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto.
The reason was “the attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the head of the IID has been identified by neighbouring countries in “direct threats to the invasion of Ukraine” and “support of separatist sentiments in Ukraine” as well as in participation “in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violations by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian law”.
Let us note that before Siyarto, the governor of Kyiv-Pecher Lover Paul and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) Onufrey agreed to the Purgatory.
The reason was their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos of the Ukrainian Local Church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatia, President Petr Porosenko of Ukraine demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities named the amount of a "golden parachute" of a deputy assassin.
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronez Region, Yuri Aguibalova, was made under the Regional Law on Public Posts.
However, the actual amount of the “golden parachute” released from the post was several times lower than that reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the press service of the regional Government.
According to the law, the salary for the post of Agibalov is 11,189.
Thus, in the press service, the lump sum was less the income tax of 223,892 rubles than the 1 million rubles reported by the media.
The official has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
He has served in public office for more than nine years.
The appointment of the pension and the lump sum payment were made immediately after his resignation and explained to RIA Novosti in the Government of the region.
At the same time, Aguibal's pension payments had been suspended at the time of appointment and his salary had not changed since the previous period.
The winner of the governor's election, the governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, took office on 15 September.
Agibalova was released from office as a result of the expiration of the term of office of the chief of the district.
Similarly, the credentials of other officials who held public office in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, the Nezygar Canal Telegram published documents that indicated that Agibalov, who had resigned from the position of vice-governor, had paid an exit benefit of 23 salaries, and two days later he was again given a similar post without a “vrio” addition.
Member of the Gosduma called for schoolchildren to be told about the damage to masturbation
Onishchenko is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his work experience, he noted in an interview that young people were exposed to masturbation to the harmful information they found on the Internet.
This is being dealt with at the educational and family level, a deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, MP of Gosduma RF (in an interview with Govorit Moscow radio station):
In the context of the general sex education of children, it is necessary to do so by explaining the harm, because there is a risk of a child ' s sexual health, both the boy and the girl.
Objectively, it is that the development of children is early enough, and large scissors continue to appear between their puberty and the possibility of formal inter-sex contacts.
In the view of Onishchenko, the problem is hampered by “funishment”, neglect of “gender age” and lack of a culture of adequate child education.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers face masturbation.
The Deputy believes that the practice of teaching about the harm of masturbation is primarily in the schools of “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we won't be able to understand you, to speak softly," said the professor.
Gennady Onishchenko is an active academic at RAMN, a member of the RAMN Bureau, a doctor of medical science, a professor.
A well-deserved doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, a member of the Bureau of the Russian Public Society's League of Health of the Nation.

AdH became the second most popular in Germany
The Anti-Immigrant Alternative for Germany is another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
It seems that Germans have begun to give serious attention to Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country the leading target of millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most prominently, recent sociologists say that the Anti-Immigrant Party “Alternative for Germany” is becoming more popular and that the position of the ruling bloc Merkel and Zeehofer is weakening.
This week, AdH scored another record, rising to the second line in popular sympathy ratings.
Right-wing conservatives, with 17 per cent of popularity, were able to bypass social Democrats, with about 16 per cent.
The gap in one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but it cannot be overlooked that the fact that the ADG created in 2013 from a small group of Eurosceptic economists has succeeded in becoming a major political force.
Leadership in general is still holding back the ruling HS/HD block, with about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards loss of points, with Angela Merkel's support being four percentage points higher in April.
The German Chancellor's personal rating, which is headed by the Government of Germany for a fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are in support of Angela Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
Add that the "greens" (15 per cent), the left (11 per cent) and the liberals (10 per cent) followed the social Democrats.
Evolution of the Alternatives.
The “Alternative for Germany” party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Group “Alternative Choice 2013”, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group initially stood up as an opposition to the Government course, but at the first stage only economic issues, including the problems of the euro and interaction within the EU, were dealt with.
In doing so, the group opposed Germany's “support” of the EU's weak economies, not excluding the possibility of a return to the German brand and the country's full withdrawal from the European Union.
In view of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which took over the ranks of Eurosceptics and began to severely criticize the Government for the failure of immigration policies.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, AdH was able to make its first break in Bundestag, with 94 MP chairs (from 709).
Two representatives of “Alternatives for Germany” received seats in the European Parliament.
A video with a journalist who called citizens of Ukraine “the nation of Bolvanov” has been published.
A leading political show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books by Ostap Drozdov openly admitted that he considered his compatriots the “nation of the Bolvans”.
Trust the TV and read little.
As Drozd said, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been taught a culture of reading and text acceptance since childhood”, said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of a lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Broadcasting of the Independent began to fight against literature with the slightest hint of criticism from the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the entry of as many as 201 editions.

Date of death of the universe
The universe is still around 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world that has been observed at some 13.8 billion years.
The study of an international team of scientists has been published in the library of e-contestants arXiv.org and published in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to such conclusions by observing the Subaru telescope's HSC (Hyper Supreme-Cam) camera for approximately ten million galaxies.
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounted for more than 95 per cent of the energy mass of the world under review, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model
The Subaru Observatory's press release notes that observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of matter distribution in the universe, while the recording of the European Planck Space Telescope has clarified the limitations imposed on the
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had submitted new arguments that the world would cease to exist 22 billion years later as a result of the Great Breakdown.
Another attempt to unite pension referees failed.
The opportunity to learn the people's views on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
On Saturday, Moscow held a general-federal initiative referendum group against the increase in retirement age.
It brought together representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered different language issues (five entries were registered by the Centre as a whole).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: “Do you consider that the age at which citizens of Russia are entitled to an old-age pension should not be increased as set out in the pension legislation as of 1 July 2018?”
This language was registered by a voluntary sub-group, whose representatives did not participate in the assembly, but was considered to be the simplest and most legal loop.
Most of the meeting participants were supporters of Ili Sviridova (six sub-groups) and KPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronez and Orenburg.
Sviridov used to say "The News" that invitations had been sent to all the initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of some 40 sub-groups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, the head of the Voluntary Subgroup (the language was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said, "The Truth," that she did not receive or plan to come, "We did not understand who the friend was and who the enemy was."
The blue singer Otis Rash died.
At the age of 84, a famous Chicago blasphemous guitarist and singer Otis Rash died, reports the AP referring to his manager, Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke carried over in 2003.

He received great publicity in 1956 after the song "I Can't Quit You Baby", which took the sixth line of Billboard R&B rating.
Admiral has caused us a lot of problems.
Zinetula Bilaledinov: "Admiral" has caused us great problems.
Zinetul Biljeltinov, chief coach of the Aq Barsa, scored the match of the regular KHL champion against Admiral (4:2).
"A hard game was, complicated.
A rival fought with dignity, causing us great problems.
I'm glad we played well today, most of us.
I've already told you that naked people will come sometime, and that's what's important for us to work on.
And what we have won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this series?"
"We have our own program on which he works.
That's why there's been a solution," says Bilaledin's press service to the club.
Ilon Musk will leave as head of the Tesla Board.
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk would have to resign as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a $20 million fine.
At the same time, the businessman will retain the position of the company's principal executive director, AFP reports with reference to the controller's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.

In the Loco game, "Ahmat" errors of Turbin fell like a horn of abundance.
Former Allied Judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of Evgeny Turbine's arbitrator at the 9th Tour of the Russian champion Locomotiv, Ahmat, and discussed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate Eugenia Turbin in the Locomotive game, Ahmat?
- I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his reluctance to judge the Russian Prime Minister's match.
I am surprised that the efforts made in the fifth round of Spartacus, Dinamo, and Turbin himself, and the leaders of DSI, have not made any serious conclusions on its low qualifications.
The result was not slowed down in the ninth tour: errors in his actions, private omissions of rude receptions fell like a horn of abundance.
For example, for the 50th minute, Eder's railroadman swoops with his hands in his criminal court defender, Ahmat Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put the pens in.
- How do you rate an episode involving Idov, which was 82nd minute when it seemed like the ball had fallen into his hand?
- I think this is where the defenseman's hand was deliberately playing in his fine square.
The Turbin was close to the moment, he's got a good look at this episode and his first assistant on the right.
This was also the moment for a stand-by judge, Sergei Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three of them went to sleep, and the penalty was not assigned.
So the check in the uterus is distorted, and sports justice has been laundered.
It was the same case when the judge’s idea of a game got out of hand and buried the sports spirit.
At 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove the attorney of the guests of Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Kríkówyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't exactly show up on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of justice, that some teams are put in pens for violations such as the episode with Idova, and some are not.
What do you think of footballer’s words?
- Seeing what you mean by double standards.
There was penalty.
He wasn't given.
So the arbitrator doesn't put the second penalty in the opposite gate.
This is the principle used.
And the second moment of double standards that the judge sees who plays.
Here's the game on Saturday, Locomotiv, and Ahmat has serious claims for Turbin's work because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon played the rapist with Judge Kavano at the SNL launch.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court of Bretta Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new Saturday Night Live transmission on NBC television.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at the Senate hearings on rape charges.
A candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotions and detailing his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Thus, Cavanaugh repeatedly admitted his love of beer, but he stated that he had never been drunk before.
In addition, Kavano claimed that he had been a virgin in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape.
These points were also played by Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and not think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said the judge in Matt Damon's execution.
Before that, Kavanaugh was elected U.S. Supreme Judge.
Barbra Streisand discovered the strange behavior of her cloned dogs
The American singer Barbra Streisand stated that the clones of her dead dog behaved quite differently than an original pet.
"They don't look like them.
In fact, [the branches] look like it, but it's impossible to clone the soul," emphasized a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cathode-tulaire dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the chihuahua dogs called Miracle Milly (Miracle Milly) was cloned 49th time by the smallest dog in the world.
Specialists are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States of America has considered a Russian maritime blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the U.S., Russia's maritime blockade can be launched to gain an advantage on the world energy market.
The U.S. authorities are so keenly engaged in the fight for success in the world's carbon market that they are ready to resort to the Russian maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's leading energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, the head of the U.S. Navy, told the possibility of a maritime blockade on the eve.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does not perform police functions but performs civilian functions, including natural resources policies.
Zinke's statement was therefore well within the purview of the head of the department, although no political ornament was deprived.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that the U.S. naval forces were controlling the sea routes to the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian transfers to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a lion's share of its revenues from oil and gas supply to the world market.
The desire to allocate energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for revitalizing Moscow in the region, Zinke is confident.
The Minister realized that the United States was still looking forward to leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington will have to strengthen Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure, Zinke believes.

Formula-1 Grand Prix of Russia Race
There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former Captain Chelsea and England's Companion John Terry, about why he went to the ninth round of the Russian champion "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club that I'm watching.
I've been stalking quite recently, and I've been interested in looking at it from the side.
I can't say I'm a dentist because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have the sympathies to Spartacus and I want to apologize once again for the decision made, because Terry's site of the Chelsea fans.
Recall that Rostov, with 18 points, rose to third in the tournament table, and Spartacus was placed on the fifth line, with 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and white on 7 October will play with Eniseem on the trip, and the Trustary Valeria Karpina will be hosted by Orenburg on the day before.
The expensive violin was put in a pawn shop for a priceless price.
When in the town of Somerville (Massachusetts), LBC Boutique and Loan brought in a violin for an old and unpresentable tool the pawnbroker offered only $50.
But an experienced shop manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and requested advice from an expert.
It was discovered here that the violin was produced in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Galiano and estimated at $250,000.
The only loops to the violin are estimated at $16 to $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin had not been stolen from one of the city's residents long ago, and the instrument had been returned to the rightful owner.
Until it is known how the violin got to the man who gave it to the pawn shop, but there is no previous conflict with the law behind it.
The manager says that now everyone who brings the pawnshop violin will ask to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round, the HRL is expecting us an exciting confrontation: Spartacus will take us to his stadium in Tustov, under the leadership of Valeria Karpina, a person, as is known, of no other "national team".
It is especially touching that meeting that clubs now have an equal number of 15 points, and they share 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, lagging behind the far-off Zenita and standing in the same spot from Beauty, which is playing with Dinamo tomorrow.
The red and whites now have a tough streak: the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals; in the League of Europe, the team of Massimo Carrera suddenly flew in Rapidou, and recently joined the house of Ahmatu.
After a derby with the CSCA, which ended with a just nobody, Spartacus with a minimum bill and not without difficulty played the Black Seatz in Cuba, and early on to talk about whether Russia's most popular club had drawn closer to getting out of the crisis.
He couldn't win three matches, but he doesn't know how to beat five more matches.
Let's see if Karpina can continue a losing streak of such a principled match.
The previous meeting of Karpinian Rostova with Spartacom ended in favour of the capital team.

Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said.
But England would protect its values, he emphasized during the meeting of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
More and more, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, enemies operating in gray areas with cybers and false news, the Minister added.

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia holds a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first voted by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a hot supporter of the Republic's name in Northern Macedonia.
International organizations are monitoring preparations for the referendum and today ' s votes.

The translator compared the mentality of Russian and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples differed, but the few differences between them did not play a great role in understanding.
On the International Translator's Day, 30 September, this was reported by the forensic interpreter Burbel Sacks.
She has been translating Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan things calmly, and the Russians, as the saying in the proverb says, "for a long time, they're going fast."
But it seems to me that, for the sake of understanding among the peoples and for the interpreter's work, this does not play a significant role," said the specialist in the commentary "RIA Novosti".
According to the translator, in order to understand that the two countries do not get along with each other, “just enough to know the story”.
And in the future, Sacks noted, there's no point in Germany ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there's no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny," she said.
On the day before, German Chancellor Angel Merkel stated that the country was trying to "relate" with Russia and support them.
She said that Berlin was particularly concerned with the project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which was built from the Russian coast to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

Tonight's school comedy is headed by the U.S. Box Office
Tonight's school camedy, which debuted in American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million on its first weekend at the prom.
This resulted in an unthinkable painting with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Hedddish leading the U.S. Box Office from 28 to 30 September.
In the international market, the film has so far been released in only 20 countries, raising $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line of the creation of Malcolm Lee, which is remarkablely enough to be seen in front of the second novelist of the western race, the multitip "Smolfoot", a curious story of the amusing Yeta with a representative of the human race, in which he never believed in the existence of the main character.
Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig's project collected $23 million for their start-up weekends, meeting the expectations of experts predicting 20-25 million per weekend.

Following the horrors of Corinne Hardy, another representative of Genro, Halfest, one of the leading youth horrors of the year, was placed at the end of the weekend.
Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked in a number of large horror projects, including Happy Day of Death, where Hallfest was very similar to the place, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh became "Poorly Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems to not think to fall out of the top-10 U.S. Box Office: the romantic comedy that has been on the screens for the seventh week; the end of September is the sixth in the ranking of the most cash tapes of the genre in all history with a figure of 165.7 million.

Add that the long-awaited Vienna with Tom Hardy, who, without any particular problems, will take over the leadership of the U.S. Box Office on the first weekend of October.
From the other premieres next week, it is worth highlighting the musical melodrama "The Star Was Born", the Venice Film Festival laureate from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hatred".

Valery Bellov: Lord assisted "Sibiri" today
William Belov, head coach of Vitozya, is about the defeat of Siberia (3:4) at the match of the KHL regular champion.
"Collega was talking about the Siberian fans, and I want to mention our fans," says Belle's official website, "Vitusia."
"I hope they will also support it, because almost every game full of stadiums now has a great atmosphere.
After the game, I'm sure the Lord helped Siberia today, because they were very rudely mistaken, especially our leaders.
Our leading leaders have actually lost the micro game: 0:3 so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, though there were moments.
But still, I'm going to take the blame.
Because they seem to have missed something in preparation.
It was a different team compared to the last match."
"It's a dirty fairy."
The viewers are outraged by Agutin's election to the Voice show.
The viewers of the "Voice 60+" show accuse the teacher Leonidas Agutin of "indecisive serenity and sudden assault".
When in the blind hearings he learned from the first note the voice of his father Nikolay Agutin, many hoped that he would maintain his neutrality and not return to the executioner.
But his sons ’ feelings took over, and he chose his relative as his team.
At that time, many thought it was a joke, but they forgave the teacher the objectivity at the first stage.
But the joke was too long, and the star's father took the place of the more worthy performers completely unwarranted.
And now the viewers are not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday, as a watcher of the show, we were outraged by the covetous and frank push of our close relatives on the final ladder.
I have even doubted that Agutina will be strong enough to keep her dad from getting to the end of the day," said Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin in the TV program.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "slyed" the beautiful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this to what the viewers still want to see in his father's show.
But, as it turns out, it's not true, the audience wants an objective evaluation and a really talented performance in the final, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the Voice of the Agutin team -- they were doomed."
"Last time, Agutin showed how he loved his dad, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and to leave in the draft your father who doesn't sing but whisper, what can we call a mentor afterwards?"
"I like the way Dad sings, throw him a concert in Kremlin for his money, and see how many people come to this concert."
It's the Voice show, not the Bloody Relatives show.
"It was unprofessional on the side of Agutina."
"Then on your own show, you have to propose to the Pope, not to the show that's done for 1 Canal's money."
"That was a real chance for someone, and he took someone else's place.
And I don't understand why the voiceless pope should make me understand more than any other participant with actual vocal data.
Why did a working man from Surgut, with a magnificent voice and a timbre, merge, and Father Agutin led to the finale?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on the stage and from the screens for decades!
'Cause you don't want to go through the bush!'
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
It's all over the swamp, and it's funny.
Even the money in the family budget is not going to be too much!
"The theater of absurdity continues!"
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voice, the son of Gradsky went to the blind hearings.
Then the subway did not come to the head to take the son to his own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, everything is clear."
Agutin couldn't act as a professional.

Head of the Institute for Space Research RAN, Correspondent RAN Anatoly Petrukovic told RIA Novosti about a possible programme of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts in the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was now working on the development of such a work.
“No consolidated opinion so far”, the scientist emphasized.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, thus avoiding interference from which the Earth was the source.
“It is the only place such a telescope could be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation”, Petrukovic added.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, using local resources to build.
In addition, cosmonauts should be called upon to search for a primitive organ on the Earth’s satellite, says the scientist.
This could help to determine how life appears on the planet.
Formerly, the head of Roscosmos said that in an optimistic version of the RF, a piloted flight to the Moon could take place by 2030.
The offended client threw out a basket of feces at 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called "he had a tooth" for the manager of the 7-Eleven round-the-clock shop: in May, he brought him out of the store for a bad behavior.
And he decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went to the store and poured out on the floor and on a portion of the goods on the shelf the contents of the basket.
There were faeces and urine in the basket, which Simms “borrowed” from a nearby mobile biotualite.
Police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the vigilante.
He was put in jail and released before a bailiff of $300.
He was accused of trespassing into someone else's property and criminal activity, and was also prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms' crime appears to be more ridiculous than serious, a court sentence may be sufficiently severe, as he has repeatedly violated the law: it is followed by theft in large sizes, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving a car unwarranted and ill-treatment of animals.
In the United States, Russia’s most formidable submarine
The most formidable enemy submarine for the U.S. Navy will be the Russian submersible Kazan of the Yasen-M project, writes The National Interest.
The submarine was released into the water in March 2017, but it will be released to the Navy in 2019.
According to the publication, even the predecessor of Kazani, a submarine named Severodvinsk, was commended by the U.S. military.
We will face a fierce potential opponent.
Just look at Severodvinsk, quote The National Interest Counter-Admiral Dave Johnson.
In doing so, the publication says that the United States retains the advantage in this industry over Russia.
The multi-purpose nuclear submarines "Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Crasnoyarsk" and "Archangelsk" are built on the improved project "Yasen-M" (885 M).
They have a water displacement of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 metres, a crew of 64, an autonomy of 100 days, an underwater speed of 31 knots.
The submarine is armed with mines, torpedoes 533 mm, Oniks and Calibr.
In August, U.S. Navy press stated that US submarines remained “the most powerful and frightening of the world”.
German politicians ignored the opening of the mosque because of Erdogan
Prime Minister of the Federal Land of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Lashett and Ober-burgmaster Kelna Henrietta Reker ignored the opening ceremony of the new town mosque.
Deutsche Welle writes about it.
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, took part in the event.
Lashett met with Erdogan at Cologne Airport, but refused to go to the mosque, explaining that the event could have become “a highly politicized event”.
Reker reported that she had received an informal invitation before the opening on Friday, 28 September.
According to her press secretary, such a proposal should be regarded as late and non-serious.
In front of the mosque, Erdogan made a two-day visit to Germany.
He said that he had succeeded in meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had discussed, inter alia, the fight against racism and Islamophobia.
The new mosque in Cologne has become one of the largest in Europe, and it has the capacity to accommodate some 1,000 believers at the same time.
The construction amounted to EUR 30 million, with funding provided by the Turkish side.
In Ivanov, you can become a diver, a spleeologist, or a climber.
The training will be conducted by the Rescue Youth Club, located at the Regional Centre.
However, these three interesting professions do not limit the activities of the club - audiences of numerous courses and seminars will also be able to learn a sailing case, a medical disaster, a parachute training and an initial knowledge of psychology.
In addition to theoretical knowledge, the audience also receives practical fees in the club programme.
More detailed information will be available at IHTU on 8 October (on Monday) at 7:30 in auditorium 201 (corpus B) and at IGEO on 10 October (on Wednesday) at 7:30 in auditorium B-516.
All classes are free.

I was very impressed with the first game.
I think we're gonna get him to play further.

The U.S.U. identified and detained the owner of the Peugeot-301 car, who had previously travelled to the capital with the license plate of the so-called D.D.R.
They were a former IMF official who is currently working as an agent of a Ukrainian insurance company.
According to the UBU press centre, the detainee explained that the vehicle had been in Interpol's search since 2014 and had been detained in Russia and handed over to it as a representative of the insurance company.
When crossing the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed the feicing plates, but when he entered Kiev, he reestablished them.
He said that he did so “in order to ensure that the car registration numbers of the package of documents were in conformity with the machine issued by the Russian Interpol representatives in case the vehicle was stopped for inspection by the Ukrainian police officers”.
“A set of measures are currently under way to verify the explanations provided, as well as to establish its possible involvement in terrorist activities”, stated the UDF.
It should be noted that in Ukraine the use of terrorist numbers in the territories they have seized of Donbass is prohibited.
By the way, a member of the State Border Service had previously seen a car with similar numbers in Mariola.
Minfin predicts a reduction in the rate to 73.9 rubs/dils by 2031-2035 g.
Minfin Russia predicts a gradual reduction in the rate of rubles to 73.9 roubles per United States dollar for the period up to 2036.
The agency also predicts stabilizing global oil prices in the $40-50 diapozone for barrels during this period.
This is indicated in the budget forecast of the RF before 2036 on the budget system portal.
According to Minfina RF, the U.S. dollar rouble rate for 2021-2025 is estimated to be 66.4 rub. / dollar in 2026-2030 - 71.1 rub. / dollar and for 2031-2035 - 77.9 rub. / dollar.
In addition, the Russian department estimates that oil prices on the medium- and long-term horizon are highly likely to stabilize between $40 and $45 per barrel at constant prices.
The Urals oil, much of the Minfina forecast, will cost between 2021 and 2025 - $55.2 per barrel, in 2026-2030 - $52.2 per barrel, and in the period 2031-2035 - $52.9 per barrel.
In the United States, Russia's possible maritime blockade
The United States may, if necessary, set up a maritime blockade on Russia to prevent its supply of energy to the countries of the Middle East.
Ryan Zinke, U.S. Interior Minister, said so.
Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of department stated that for the Russian economy the only source of income was the sale of energy and Moscow was active in the Middle East to sell oil and gas there, as it did in Europe, writes Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that the situation is similar with Iran.
In the Minister's view, there are two options: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use the first one, so it is necessary to put pressure on and squeeze out Iranian energy.
Russian rockets will conduct exercises on the Baltic Sea
The Baltic Air Force military will conduct exercises on the shore of the Baltic Sea.
On 30 September, Interfax reports on this with reference to the head of the News Division of the Western Military District Press Service for the Baltic Roman Martov.
The ships of the conditional enemy will be struck by a beach missile complex designed to combat submarines and protect the coastline of the Kaliningrad region.
“The missiles will be given direction at their positions and will produce electronic thrusts from the Bal and Bastion missile complex along the side of the enemy ships”, said Martov.
The military shall also verify the operational capacity of the missile systems as part of the exercises and undertake the loading and unloading of the missile complex.
In August, a 949A nuclear submarine, Eagle, took part in the training of ships of the Russian Navy in the Baltic Sea.
The elements of anti-distortion, anti-mine, anti-aircraft, anti-cold and anti-corrigible defence were then used.
The Ukrainian Navy has completed its exercises at the Azov Sea
Ukraine's Navy (MSF) completed the Kazakskaya will-2018 command and command exercises in the Azov Sea and reported on 30 September at the country's Navy Press Centre.

The military was involved in boats and boats.
The tactical teams on the boats carried out combat shootings, isolated the coastline and protected maritime communications, TASS reported.
In the meantime, the ship's team performed mine-container scenarios.
According to the Ukrainian Air Force for Counter-Admiral Training, Alexei Neijpapapa, a key element of the exercises is first of all the interaction with the air force and the ground-to-air troops.
On 29 September, Head of the Ministry of Ukraine, Arsen Avakov, stated that the agency had increased its units in the Azov Sea.
Rostovchanin ranked third in the Greek-Roman international tournament

I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Sergei Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Russian pilot Williams Sergey Sirotkin commented on the outcome of the Gran pri Russia race.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and on the second turn, I was in between two cars, which I was struck right away.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
Turns out he's in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us got to the pit stop, we'd get to clean air, and we'd get back to speed, but the rubber was gone.
Plus, he was fighting his partner, and he was in contact with him.
I understand he's been a little wrong.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most impeccable route of the season, and I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says RIA "New."
Remind me that Sirotkin finished 18th in the Grand Prix race, and the British pilot Lewis Hamilton became the winner.
Tarpsev called absurd removal of Głusakova and Estchenko from the foundation of "Spartacus"
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpishev commented on the removal of the footballers of Moscow's Denis Głusakova and Andrea Estchenko from trainings with the main composition after swearing to criticise the chief coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports Sport Weekend.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
It's unintelligent to pay attention to things like that.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It's only deepening the decomposition on the team.
First of all, it's poetry, reading and understanding.
I wouldn't have reacted to that at Carrera's place.
Everyone has an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to get sick.
If Głusak and Estchenko are barking, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility to understand the situation.
And that doesn't serve the normal climate on the team.
Now, Spartacus doesn't have a game, so it wasn't supposed to be a big deal at all.
Maybe you should have just laughed at it together.
Spartacus has a lot on different lines, there's an immensity when young people are introduced.
The relationship within the team does not seem to add optimism to this match," said Tarpishev.
The two teams will be played on September 30th and will begin at 7 p.m. Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously rejected Spartacus, led the Chelsea Youth Team.
Sirius schoolchildren discussed environmental technologies with scientists
Students from the Sirius Educational Centre in Sochi, participants from the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture of scientists from the National Research Centre of the Kurčatov Institute.
The researchers' presentation was part of the Global International Forum of Convergence and Environmental Technologies programme, organized at Sochi, on behalf of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, on the educational centre website on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film by Koda Kurchatova, in which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, Correspondent RAN Mikhail Kovalchuk, presented global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lesson is published on the Sirius website.
The students learned that modern technologies needed a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such amounts.
Environmental technologies that young scientists are working on today will help to address this problem, according to the forum organizers.
Kowalchuk also raised the topic of responsibility for the development of environmental technologies and described the risks inherent in the creation of such technologies.
"The coming of such technologies is a unique thing, a tremendous good.
This is an explosive growth in medical technology, which is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second side.
Environmental technology development is in fact a technological replication of wildlife systems.
There's a negotiable side -- targeted interference in human life.
There's always risks.
There was a car, and people started to die under their wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quotes scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing the current scientific breakthroughs, the schoolchildren were able to ask questions to the meeting.
Speakers were a candidate for the physics and mathematical sciences, head of the Kurchatov complex of natural sciences NIC "Curchatov Institute" Julia Djakova and head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIX Technology Viacheslav Demin.
Sirius Education Centre in Sochi was established by the Talant and Success Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure initiated by President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The objective of the educational centre is early identification, development and further professional support for gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the cyber-exhibition of all-Russia online-Olympiads would provide training in Sirius.
Air traffic controller saved a plane with passengers during an earthquake in Indonesia
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller named Antonius Gunnavan Agung, who saved hundreds of passengers from Batik Air at a cost of his life.
On 28 September, he worked at Palu's Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on the island of Sulavesi.
At the time of the great earthquake, an airliner was preparing to take off.
Agung refused to leave the command post and helped the plane get up.
When the magnetium fluctuations reached 7.4, the tower began to collapse.
The 21-year-old dispatcher had to jump from four floors.
When he fell, he was seriously injured by internal organs, and the doctors were unable to save him.
The Russian submarine Kazan scared the United States of America.
The Russian submarine Kazan represents the greatest danger to the U.S. fleet.
American counter-admiral Dave Johnson said so, referring to The National Interest.
“We are threatened by a fierce potential opponent.
All you have to do is look at Severodvinsk, he said, pointing to the model predecessor Kazani.
According to the US Navy Commander in Europe, James Foggo, Russia has focused its efforts on upgrading its submarine.
Macedonia: referendum not due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country as “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The name was used to open the way to NATO and later to the EU in the former Yugoslav Republic.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34 per cent of the phenomenon on the resurrected plebiscites “did not reach the constitutional threshold” by 50 per cent.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje might decide not to give up on the name.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polls, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, a supporter of the change in the name of the republic, said that if there were more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name, regardless of the lack of quorum.

Kemerovchan upset the flock of priests at the cemetery
On September 30, a well - known Kemerov page on the social network reported that a local cemetery was free to spread horny animals.
The cattle of the great herd passed between the fences and ravaged the grass.
The commentators expressed different views: one of the locals noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle at the cemetery, and their appetite could even help to clear the area from sorbets and herbs, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not have to do so by heart:
"It's the graves, not the pastures.
There's nothing to do with the rams.
Of the rams, you will not say that they are covetous, but it is not the matter."
In any case, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
Longer and longer, what's the right thing to do?
There's no word for it.
That's right, it's a big deal.
The word “dream” means “tread, exert influence, influence” exists only on a phonetic basis, because we hear the sound [a] instead of the word “touch”.
We use that word, assuming it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "doing" not only not only close, but even in some way opposite.
See for yourself.
Prolonged (circle-book, outdated) means “enough, complete, sufficient, to be sufficient for anyone or anything to satisfy”.
Satisfaction, pleasure are related words.
He used to have the meaning of "doing nothing, self-sufficient" -- "do yourself."
The Old Slavan "wolves" are related to the words "lead" and "will".
To push, to crush, it's different.
In these words, the truly frightening 'parents': daos - the wolf (older sheep), deyja - 'dimat' and djidī - are 'concerned'.
The similar phonetic shape of the words “pressure” and “to endure”, as well as the inevitable weariness of the latter, forced them to become contaminated.
That's how we came to have the same "d" that they use in writing through "a", which is, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of those words.
So it's the right thing to do.
But that word is outdated, in its proper sense no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative effect on you from above, use the word “dream”.
You can also use the "show pressure" structure, but remember, it's a chancellor.
Russia is the leader of the EuroSkills championship in Budapest
The Assembly of Russia has become the leader of the EuroSkills Championship in Europe.
The event was held in Budapest, TASS writes.

Our car is a noticeably slow Mercedesa.
"Ferrary" pilot Kimmy Rykkonen, on the qualification of the Grand Prix of Russia, which led him to take fourth place.
"Whoi, did you have a chance to fight for the field today?
How good was the car?"
"It looks like Mercedes was much faster today," says Riekkonen F1News.Ru.
But the behavior of our car has turned out to be the best since the wake-up call."
"At the course of your qualification, you did not give in to Sebastian Fettel's speed, but in the end the delay was still noticeable.
What is the reason?"
"My attempt went well, but then someone from the Mercedes racers came forward.
He was preparing to try, and yet he was able to miss me, but I think I've lost some time.
After all, it is unlikely that this has had a profound impact on the outcome."
"In Sochi, it's very difficult to chase, the start of the race will be a key moment?"
"You may, yes, but you never know how it's gonna work.
It's not going to be easy, either, because our car is noticeably slowing down the Mercedes cars.

A welcoming man gave a small exclusive parking lot, the magazine Behind the Drive
Miracles still happen in our lives!
A German journalist named Christie Ditz told about one of them on Twitter.
She wrote on her page that her four - year - old son had parked his rune (child without pedals) around the same lamppost all year round.
And one morning, there was a nice sticker with a green bicycle picture and a "only for him" sign.
My mother and my baby loved each other, and there was no limit.
Christie thanked an anonymous benefactor and commended him for an interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet spread rapidly across the social media and made many people smile.
The comments made by him were also remarkable:
"How wonderful!"
"Thank you for having such a great time in this world."
"I think there's a lot of people in the world who can do that."
"Unfortunately, they don't attract the same attention as the rascals."

Russian supplies require debt from a dead old man
In Kurgan, the courts demanded that a long-dead woman pay 200 roubles.
This is reported by the Ural Meridian.
In mid-September, relatives of the deceased Maria Mitrofanovna Slepnevna received a letter from the Kurgan Division of the Court of Justice stating that an executive proceeding had been initiated against 105-year-old women.
A woman must pay 200 roubles at the court ' s discretion for a local tax inspection.
Upon receiving the letter, the relatives of Blepnevo requested clarification from the department.
The suspense Division had promised to deal with the situation.

In Germany 14,000 people went to a demonstration against racism
Some 14,000 people took part in a demonstration against racism in the German town of Hamburg.
The action was supported by more than 450 organizations under the slogan “Vehicle against Racism”.

Participants also stated that the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean must cease to be an offence.
In addition, the demonstrators demanded the resignation of the head of the Ministry of the Interior of the FWG Horst Zeehofer and the dissolution of the constitutional protection agency.
Nebroz Duman, one of the participants in the campaign, stated that the aim of the demonstration was to demonstrate the unity of society and solidarity in the matter.
Refugees and migrants should not be considered as different, and migration themselves should be the mother of that society.
Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations have sent an open letter to the Minister requesting resignation.
Russia has protected itself from terrorists by means of an operation in Syria.
In the three years of Russia's military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists were killed, 85,000 of whom were destroyed by the Air and Space Forces of the Russian Federation.
In connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria, former head of the WCC, head of the Federation Security and Defence Council Committee, Victor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-pollutants: the air-space forces carried out and continued to strike directly at terrorists ' targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorists have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition depots, reinforcements and headquarters.
With Russian air strikes, Jihadist defenses have been breached, which has been a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government troops, reports Interfax.
According to Bondarev, our military operations in Syria also enabled Russia to shield itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of an operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IG banned in Russia) and the Jebhat al-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about 4,000 Russian civilians and about 5,000 people of the post-Soviet countries fought on the IH side.
And it's only those registered, not those who weren't identified, that's what Bondarev said.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter freely into our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on the far edge; otherwise, it would "breathe us".

Syria Indicted the United States of America in Support of Terrorism
The head of the Syrian MoID, Walid Muallem, accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Rakka, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was directed, and massacred civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes," he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and their partners provided “direct support to terrorists” as the goals of the militants and Western coalition in Syria coincided and implied “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction in their path”.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria was almost completed and that the country was safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to rid Syria of an illegal foreign presence and would give priority to Syrian partners in rebuilding the country.
In September, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, head of the Russian Centre for Reconciliation of Hostile Parties in the Republic, stated that two U.S. F-15 aircraft had struck the Syrian province of Deir eZ-Zor with proscribed Phosphoric Ammunition.
The United States rejected all charges.
President Peter Porosenko of Ukraine believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The Head of State made this statement during his visit to the Harkov Region, commenting on Hungary ' s issuance of its passports in Zakarpatia.
In protecting Ukrainian citizens, I protect the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," said Porozenko.
According to Porocenko, he will as president protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are, east or west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the MID in the passport scandal with Hungary, which was intended to expel the consul from Beregovo.
“I fully share every letter spoken by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs”, said the President.
According to FACTS, on 19 September, a video appeared on the web showing the time when Ukrainian citizens were issued at the Hungarian Consulate in Berzegovo Hungarian passports.
At the same time, they took an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, noted that the consul of Hungary, which appears on the video of the Ukrainian passports, must leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or be expelled by Kiev.
It was also known that the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Zakarpat Region had initiated a criminal case for the issuance of Hungarian passports.
An incident qualified under the heading “State treason”.
Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin held the last two days in Dushanbe, where he participated in the work of the CIS Council of States, as well as held a number of bilateral meetings with the Presidents of neighbouring countries.
The data on the flight of Russian "bort No. 1" on Flightradar indicate that about 6 o'clock in Tajik time on 28 September Il-96-300 took off from Dushanbe Airport and took a North-East course.
The transporter of the aircraft was switched off in the Lake Balhasz area.
The direction of his flight indicates that a liner could have flown to Haqasia.
According to Baykal24, the president of Abakana met personally the head of the region, Victor Zimin, on 29 September.
According to informal information, Putin flew to the Republic on weekends, but sources believe that the real reason is the "second round problem".
The second round of elections of the head of the region will be held next Sunday in The Hague.
It included Valentin Konovalov (CRCF) and the current head of the republic, Victor Zimin (the only Russian Federation).
However, Zimin withdrew his candidacy on 21 September.
The upcoming tour with Konovalov should be attended by Andrey Filyagin (“The Righteous Russia”).
The Khakas media suggest that Putin may resign the head of Hakasia and appoint a new rift in the Republic, as well as decide on the fate of Zimin.
Putin had already visited Hakasia in January of this year.
Along with Tuwa, the Republic is one of the favorite places of the President to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have been refugees since the outbreak of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, especially neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Damascus believes that military action is nearing completion and that the country is ready for voluntary return of refugees.
The Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem said of this, saying to the United Nations: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to reinstate the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions were created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that had complicated lives and deprived them of their livelihood.
The Syrian authorities also called upon the world community to facilitate and allocate funds to the return of refugees.
Meanwhile, the United States and the European Union refused to provide assistance to Syria, stating that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.

Folkswagen is trying to compensate for losses and restore customer confidence.
For example, the management of the concert has recently changed, as well as major restructuring and policy changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Folkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this right was granted to the authorities in February of this year.

Mitropolith Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC with Fascist actions
The head of the Unit of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropoly Ilarion, compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against the Jews.
“It is like that in Fascist Germany a yellow edged star was put on a Jew, which means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for that purpose”, said the Mitropolitic on the television channel Russia-24 (citate on Interfax).
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences right now when the Russian-Ukraine conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev therefore hopes to gain full control of the OPC and “put it outside the law”, the minister believes.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It was previously learned that the Supreme Council members were working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (recasting the subordination of religious communities), Nos. 4511 (with special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (recasting the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the renaming of the Moscow Patriarchate OPC.
Deputy Pochaevska Llava called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Saint-Usprene Governor of the Pochaev la Lavra Mitropiti Vladimir has called for the protection of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (CPC) was published on the home page on Saturday.
In various times our predecessors and relatives in faith and spirit had to confess their faith and protect their shrines.
Given the situation that has occurred, and the information that we have, and the threats that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive something," said the Mitropoly.
He asked for support -- prayerful, moral.
Also, the laurel's deputy stressed that it would probably “use your physical presence”.
The priest added: "The grandchildren of Lenin are in a spirit, threatened with destruction, and therefore we shall protect our sanctuary."
The fate of the Pochaev la la laurel, an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, must be ready to protect it, is stated in the treatment.
The Mitropoli called for no action against those who misled the believers.
The UPC has the canon status as defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 by the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to depend on the novelist patriarch and another Catholic pope of the Roman Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to us by the Orthodox Church.
And we are pleased with the status of our church," said the deputy laurel.
He recalled that since October 1990 the OPC has been officially independent and fully independent of its administration.
There is no administrative and financial accountability for the patriarchy of Moscow.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What else do we need, Tomos?", noted the Mitropicist Pochayevsky Vladimir, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves, "Does other Tomos religions have any other denominations, are they independent of the Vatican?"
The believers have been selected to some extent and have determined which temple to go to.
However, someone wants to plant hostility and strife again.
Some are jealous that they shine dome on the temples which they want to destroy," said the priest.
The Pchaeva laurea is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
There is a laurel at the top of Pochaevska Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopolis.
The first historical record of it refers to the beginning of the 13th century.

Instagram, another sad post of Bouzava has angered subscribers
A singer and a TV conductor, Olga Bouzov, cannot survive the "story" of the show "Marry for Buzow" by Evgeny Nazarov, who preferred her money and left the project.
The World Left published another sad post in Instagram, which angered its subscribers.
"I never thought that feelings could be priced.
Life continues to teach me... and when I'm about to start understanding people," said Buzov.
Many fans reacted negatively to such a position and noted that in fact, the singer “did not actually see life”.
"You haven't suffered that yet.
You warm up to every word, feed in a normal, normal family," wrote @nataliama37.
There were also those who advised Buzov to consult psychologists or at least read books on the subject.
"Can we read literature in psychology?
What do you need to do to avoid shrinking the victim?" @liashukgalina wrote.
However, there were also those who supported the singer.
"Oh, don't be upset.
Your man will not speak loud words across the country and then simply fail to do so," supported Buzu @arina_prostyle.
"You and the queen need a king, and the one who turned you into papers just doesn't deserve you.
Above your nose and go further," @prezentia_f wrote.
In the past, Nazarov explained his decision to take 2 million roubles and to give up Buzov because the singers lack sympathy for him.
All the money he decided to spend on charity.
If we continue to play also correctly, victory will come
The main coach of Moscow's Dynamo Vladimir Vorobyev is about the defeat of the Automobileist (0:1) in the match of the regular KHL champion.
"The good game was, interesting, though she went to the goal" -- says Vorbiev's official website, "The Automobiler."
"I've tried to play very easy.
It was a great first period.
They didn't use a few good times.
In the second period, the rival gave us a little bit of support, we stood up.
But taking us away was a little fed.
The guys played great, they did the training.
I think if we keep playing the right thing too, we'll have to win.
You didn't kill, you couldn't win with zero heads, but the content of the game was right.
It will be good luck if we continue to play in this direction.”
"In your opinion, did the "Automobiler" add to the meeting in Lower Novgorod?"
"Then there was no foreign game.
At the pre-season, the teams solved other tasks, played a lot of young guys.
I think there was a whole different game, another hockey game.
"Automobiler" is a good good team.
The tournament table is clear, the team is playing right.
Good hockey, good atmosphere, both in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
Lots of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good doorman.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew that the team was going unpunished, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work out."

The main Macedonian opposition player refused to vote in referendum
In Macedonia, a referendum is held on Sunday, 30 September, on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the name of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party, “The Macedonian Internal Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity” (VMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mizkosky, stated that there would not be a vote in the referendum.
As explained by Naum Stoilkowski's press secretary, Mitskowski decided to abstain from voting in order to express his opposition to a treaty which considered it “ugnished”.
According to the Spokesman, the current referendum deals with the question of a country's name and no more than that, while the party's strategic objective is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
One week ago, President Gjorge Ivanov, of Macedonia, refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence.
“A new semi-universal State with a new name is emerging”, Ivanov noted.

U.S. Increases in Opiates Production in Afghanistan
On 26 September, there was much talk of a sharp deterioration in the situation in Afghanistan.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, China, India, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, militants have unleashed a real terrorist war against the authorities and the civilian population of the country.
The current year has become record for the number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans," Patrushev noted.
Afghanistan's woes began far from yesterday.
Following the attacks on 11 September 2001, the US chief enemy was declared a Al-Qaida terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation) in Afghanistan.
It didn't take a month for America and NATO allies to start a military operation called Enduring Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
Multi-thousand-thousand American contingent and now on Afghan soil.
And peace life is even more haunted than it was then.
American troops have been driven to take dozens of their bases.
As much as they can buy money from fighters, they will not be touched by it.
The Government of Afghanistan controls the smaller part of the country, 40 per cent, according to Patrushev.
50% in the Taliban (prohibited in the RF).
Another 10% for IGIL terrorists (prohibited in the RF).
But they're growing fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudohalifate in Central Asia, just what they did not achieve in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be doing it.
It is also encouraging that, over the course of 17 years, American drug production (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times.
The colossal growth of opium poppy areas and multi-billion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are ready to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country's name.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the outcome of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbour ' s right to be known as Macedonia, with the same name as the one-named Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, a political scientist: "By this agreement Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future, a hope for social change.
And Greece will uphold the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises, they cannot make absolutely everyone happy.”
For the name of the country, the ruling social Democrats are in charge of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against the conservative opposition and the president of the country, Gjorge Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Cilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, led by Zaewis, is obliged outside to change the country’s name.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, I'm going to lose sovereignty.
It is clear that there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice made by Macedonian citizens will determine the future not only of the Balkans but also of Europe as a whole.”
