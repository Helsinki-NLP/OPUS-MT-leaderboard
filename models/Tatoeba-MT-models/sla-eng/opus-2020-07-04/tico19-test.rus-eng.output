The rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union / Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, despite the different stages of their development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
In the light of the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, there is a need to increase patient preparedness with COVID-19, which will require treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia have been reported in Uhan of the Chinese province of Hubay.
On 9 January 2020, the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus, now known as the coronavirus of severe type 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become known as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. in the form of respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most people with disease are cured.
In approximately 14 per cent of the COVID-19 cases, a more severe form of hospitalization is being developed, while the remaining 6 per cent take critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
The study analyses the cumulative morbidity trends of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and in the UK and compares them with trends in Hubey Province of China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the existence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were recorded in France on 24 January 2020 — all three of the sick returned from Uhan of the Chinese province of Hubay.
As at 15 March 2020, infections of COVID-19 have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in Britain, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and 17,750 deaths, including 1,441 fatalities, occurring in Italy alone.
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative disease of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily data at 8 a.m. on the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country worldwide from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse the trends in the circulation of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK, and to compare them with those in Italy.
COVID-19 has been calculated as an indicator of the prevalence of active cases in 14 days of COVID-19, taking into account the normal circulation of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in EU/EEE countries and Britain
The development trends in COVID 19 in 14 days in the EU/EE countries and in Britain in general were consistent with trends observed in Hubey Province of China (Figure 1).
The cumulative disease of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to rise around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp increase in this indicator (additional material).
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEE countries and in Britain, similar trends in cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 (additional material) have been observed.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EE countries and in the UK, compared with the same number for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these figures, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 15 March in the other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to those recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of registered COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The cumulative disease trends of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases of disease and different patient selection rules to analyse the presence of COVID-19, including “presuming” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already fully filled.
Currently, data on the admission of patients from COVID-19 to the hospital and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available for only 6% and 1% respectively (not reported).
However, there is a need to systematically collect such data in order to supplement the current monitoring data, which are subject to the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to the study carried out in 2010-2011, Europe has seen a significant gap in the number of beds in intensive care and intensive care units: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 risk stress assessment presents scenarios for modelling the loading of health system resources with estimates of the hospitalization of the infected COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of lack of access to access points in intensive care units exceeds 90 per cent.
Since the cases are currently grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to provide territorial unit 2 units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 contact infection scenario, which has not been weakened for a long time, and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical attention and, in particular, intensive therapy, which can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the recent ECDC report on risk-assessment, rapid, proactive and integrated approaches to reducing the spread of SARS-COV-2 are essential, with the subsequent shift from containment to minimization, as given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases in decision-makers and hospitals, it may simply not be enough time to reflect, adopt and adjust their responses accordingly, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The report on the results of the stress risk assessment also listed public health measures designed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a small period of time within which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEA countries, there will be a influx of patients who will need intensive treatment.
The outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) corona virus has become a tragedy for humanity: so far, more than 3,000 people have died in China and other parts of the world, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus, which caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of new disease publications, this article proposes an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving subject of study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While the answers to many questions are yet to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate dangerous diseases.
The Spring Festival (China’s New Year), which ended on 25 January 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people, who were urged to stay home for the entire holiday and for weeks after the outbreak of a new virus infection.
In view of the high degree of similarity with coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease was coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and spread rapidly throughout the country, followed by nearly 50 other countries around the world.
According to data from 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported, more than 40,000 patients recovered, and more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the enemy of one for society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.ni.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-induced disease — the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known at this point about prevention and prediction of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been identified as pathogens that are not lethal to humans, and mainly cause about 15% of general respiratory diseases 4.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have twice faced highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e., the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of diseases originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and quickly spread to many other States with a horrifying severity of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the present COVID-19 is the third outbreak of a coronavirus infection in the history of mankind.
As shown in figure 1.1, a report on clusters of unknown origin pneumonia was first received to the National Health Commission of the PRC of Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death toll was recorded in Uhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic has spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it became known about the infection of med workers, which allowed the transmission of the virus from man to be possible.
On 23 January, a quarantine was imposed in Uhan, and city public transport was terminated.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with a confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the sea produce market in Uhan, which was considered a starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global public health emergency.
By the time the report was prepared, the disease had spread throughout China and had already penetrated approximately 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and risk of flash still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, provided the following updated epidemic development picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 was infected by all age groups, but people aged 30 to 65 were mainly affected.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few under 20 years of age, and only 14 of those infected had not yet reached 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly in Hubay Province and in the surrounding regions.
On average, from the time the symptoms of COVID-19 to the diagnosis occurred 5 (2-9 days).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
From the onset of symptoms to the onset of death on average, 9.5 (48–13) days were spent.
The baseline of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected, which had coincided with extensive transport traffic on the eve of the New Year ' s celebration in China.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (men), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a family of large shell viruses that contain one thread of meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-conaviruses are known to strike people.
In the event of a failure of the Type SARS and MERS, the stratum (S) glycoprotein is bound to the cell receptors of the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
Cytoplasm releases the virus RNA gene; after replication of the viral genome, the genome RNA, together with cloudy glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the membrane cell, releasing the virus.
The first reports of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence appeared on 10 January 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betaconavirus whose genome is 99.98 per cent consistent with 10 consecutive samples collected at the first point in the outbreak of the disease on the Juanan Seas Market in Uhan.
Genetically SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using an enlightening electronic microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particle was detected in human airtight airtight cuts.
ACE2 human enzyme has been established as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an ACE2 enzyme that is weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which explains that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have a lower severity than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-lived protein, encoded orf3b, and secreted protein coded orf8.
The white orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can play a role in terms of virus pathogenicity and suppress the IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a team of authors, headed by Zhou (Zhou), presented the Cryoelectronic Tomography of the ACE2-wide enzyme structure of a person authorized by 2.9 Å in conjunction with the B0AT1 amino acids transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed formations, had been assembled as a smoker and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could connect two S-proteins, which provides evidence of the identification and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target in the administration of a drug screening to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was passed to man through the bulbs and camels respectively.
Through the philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was established that the first masters of SARS-CoV-2 were bats, since the new virus was 96% identical to the two coronaviruses, namely the Coronavirus SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
It remains unknown, however, what type of intermediate host has enabled the virus to overcome the visual barrier and to infect the human being; the path of transfer is yet to be identified.
Mr. Jzi (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the vectors of the virus from bats to man had become snakes, during which the homologous recombination in S-protein had taken place.
As a result of their research, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins — long - winged mammals, who are fed by ants and who are often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1 per cent between the two genomes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
Under laboratory conditions SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive within 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40 to 50 % of humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraviolet and up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effective blocking of the virus activity can be an ether, 75 per cent lead alcohol, chlor-infectious agents, peruxic acid, chloroform and other hydro-containing solvents, but not chlor-hexidine.
The human population as a whole does not have the immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are sensitive to the new virus.
There are currently no detailed studies of immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can refer only to the earlier studies of other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
As a general rule, the host virus is first identified by the congenital immune system through the discerning receptors (ORRs), including S-type receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus stimulates the expression of inflammation factors, the ripening of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons that inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-label SARS-CoV, the immune response may be avoided.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ T cells and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells kill cells directly affected by the virus.
T cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit T cells by causing programmed deaths.
The humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies from a recovering patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system hyper-reaction entails the local education of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario lead to polyorgan inadequacy and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characteristic of the cluster, is more likely to impact older people with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The risk of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders.
According to data from the first 425 infections in Uhan, the calculated mean incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is between 1 and 14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, with a range of 0 to 24 days.
A later study, based on the demographic data of 8,866, revealed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For health authorities, it is very important to adjust the time frame for quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate estimates of the duration of the incubation period, thus preventing the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease from being unsymptomatic.
A common practice has been to provide 14-day quarantine for people who have had contact with the virus or who have been infected with the virus.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, headache, throat pain, somnolence, chest pain, diarrhoea, stiffness and vomiting.
In some patients, a week after the onset of the disease, there was exposure and/or hypoxia.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathology in the chest.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent swelling and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients required artificial light ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of cases of infection in the family and the transmission of the virus from unsymptomatic infected persons.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-CoV who also had high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and swelling (55%).
However, 80 per cent of these required artificial ventilation of lungs, much higher than that of patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), sighting (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and pain in the throat (13-25%), and artificial light ventilation is required for 14-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, with the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reaching 66,576.
Compared to this, the mortality rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10 per cent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a population study conducted in June 2012 showed mortality of 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of the earlier study, the baseline of reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at a 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, whereas R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with symptoms, mortality rates and R0 is shown in table 1.1.
The above figures show a higher potential of SARS-CoV-2 for distribution than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for infection with the new virus is lower than the latter two.
Thus, holding off the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Classified expressions often occur when infected within a family or group of people gathered together for any reason or together on a particular transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Uhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with the infected or with the disease within the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
According to the reports, however, people can be virus bearers without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been cured from the hospital may again become virus bearers, and this is an alarming signal for the extension of quarantine.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopies with leukocyte levels < 4×109/L, including leukocyte levels < 1×109/L, as well as increased asparagine aminotransferase and viraemia.
Elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin have been found in the blood of some patients, and most patients have had elevated levels of the S-reactive protein and have had red blood cells in their blood.
Patients with severe disease had an increased D-Dimer level, a breakdown of fibrin in their blood, and lymphocytes were constantly reduced.
In most patients with COVID-19, the X-ray of the chest cell was diagnosed with pathologies characterized by uneven blackouts on both sides or darkenings of the type of “mat glass” in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (RID).
In the development of ODS, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of fluid and progressive fibrosis result in a significant disruption of gas exchange.
Pneumocyte dysfunction Type I and II reduces surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of light to expand and increase the risk of loss of light.
Thus, the worst results of the X-ray study often coincide with the worst cases of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocyte deposition, the formation of gyaline membranes and intertissue lymphocyte infiltration, and multinuclear syncytic cells in lung patients who died of the disease were consistent with viral infection and ORZ pathologies and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection method was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (CCR).
However, given the high level of false results that could accelerate the development of the epidemic, clinical diagnosis began in China as of 13 February 2020 (not relying exclusively on PCA reverse transcriptase).
A similar situation was the diagnosis of SARS.
In order to effectively diagnose, therefore, it is critical and it is necessary to combine the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and the results of the X-ray study.
On 14 February 2020, the Team of Specialists, led by Mr. Feng Zhang, described the protocol of application of SHERLOC, based on a repeat CRISPR, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this method allows the detection of synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a density of 20 × 10-18 moles/l to 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of the reference sample) by means of indicative strips less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new methodology, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, could significantly improve the sensitivity of tests and their convenience.
Due to the lack of experience in countering the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide COVID-19 patients with only supportive treatment, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or have been offered to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antivirals, Immunity providers, steroids, plasma of recovering patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even healthy patients be treated with plasma.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the initial stages of the SARS-CoV-2 attack, it may be less likely that other ACE2-expressing organs, such as the gastric and kidney tract, may be affected.
Nevertheless, disruption of work and denial of respiratory organs is the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, in order to facilitate symptoms and save life, support for the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which depend on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxidation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary blood circulation technique used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory insufficiency.
In addition, the maintenance of water and salt balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organs, are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokine storm is known to be a result of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of a systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the allocation of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNα and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the immune system to emit a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ODPs and polyorganic insufficiency.
When treating a cytokine storm, especially in patients in severe condition, the suppression of immunity is essential.
Corticoids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies used as an inhibitor of interleukin-6 were used to treat cytokine storm.
Other techniques of treatment for cytokine storms based on suppression of immunity include the T-cell control immune response modulation; the cytokines blockade IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; the suppression of Janus-Kinase; the use of binamomamba, cytokine 4 subpressors and histondeacetic inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes on the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as substitutes for immunity.
However, steroids in high doses do not benefit from treatment of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the forecast.
However, short courses in small and medium-dose corticosteroids are recommended for careful treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, effective antiviral therapy was not confirmed.
However, the internal introduction of remdesivur, a nucleotide analogue, has been shown to be effective in treating an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesyvir is a recently developed antiviral medicine originally developed by the Gilead company for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, remdesvir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with a single-stage RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this data, Gilead provided this drug composition to China for couples in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as options for treatment of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver failure and other side effects.
The interaction of these medicinal products with other medicinal products designated to patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of healthy patients and antibody development
Blood loss in patients who have been treated with communicable disease has long been used to treat other patients who have the same disease or to protect the healthy population.
And in fact, the blood of recovering patients often contains a relatively high number of antibodies to control the pathogen.
Antibodies are present in an immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign objects; they identify and target pathogen molecules.
Based on this assumption, plasma was extracted from blood samples from a group of patients who had been treated by COVID-19, which was then introduced to 10 patients with severe pain.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, as well as increased blood saturation with oxygen.
However, in order to propose mass use before specific therapy is carried out, untested and unexplained explanations are required so far.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effect, consideration should be given to some of the deficiencies associated with plasma use.
For example, antibodies can unduly stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine emission syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential risk to life.
Antibody concentrations in the blood are usually low, and plasma levels are often required to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to identify healthy patients' B cells and determine the genetic code of active antibodies or to perform screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can immediately move on to mass-produced antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese people have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of multiple components of the formula, which differs depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theory of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an unspecified effect, since it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
At present, lack of effective special treatment with COVID-19 Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Fen Tze Doo (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Lian Hua Qing Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) capsules were considered effective in treating COVID-19.
The largest proportion of cured patients with COVID-19 was observed in several provinces of China where 87% of patients treated with Chinese traditional medicine, including Ghana (63.7%), Ninsia (50%) and Hubei (50%), while only about 30% of patients with COVID-19 were treated with Chinese traditional medicine, the lowest percentage of healthy people (13%) was recorded.
However, this is a rather rough comparison, as the assessment should be based on a multitude of other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatments exclusively in Western medicine and combination therapy in Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for normalizing body temperature, eliminating symptoms and providing treatment at the hospital was significantly lower for patients who were treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who were treated only on Western methods.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who had begun to become less symptomatic (from mild to severe) was observed to be lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in a group treated only in Western methods (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely controlled research, more widely and more regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in the methods of Chinese traditional medicine or their combination.
Patients who have suspected or confirmed the existence of COVID-19 are mainly threatened with acute and even fatal disease, and people who are quarantined also suffer from boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid insomnia, may cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
At the early stages of the outbreak of the disease caused by the SARS virus, there have been reports of a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behaviour.
The mandatory monitoring of contact and quarantine, among the measures taken by the health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people ' s anxiety and guilt over the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to persons suspected and in contact with them, as well as to all the other people in need.
Within the framework of psychological support, multidisciplinary mental care teams should be established, and regular and accurate updates of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans should be made available and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in disrupting the transfer chain from animal and infected people to receptive hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been done to develop S-protein-based vaccines aimed at developing long-lived and highly active neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed lively weakened vaccines from SARS viruses.
However, prior to the initiation of clinical studies, it is necessary to further determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when administered to elderly patients, the model of lethal doses and the level of protection against zoonotic infection.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus that originated in the Middle East and spread to other regions have continued to occur due to the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using the inactivated virus, DNA plasmide, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and elements of recombinant proteins, and some of these have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-Immunity individuals is an urgent and critical task that requires a response to the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long term (average 18 months) required for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic transformation of the coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients manage to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe illness.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic disease model to prioritize their actions, particularly in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on current clinical data, the following factors may affect or be associated with the disease forecasting of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the disease caused by the SARS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients requiring intensive therapy were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (mean 66 years versus 51 years), which suggests that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than that of women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive therapy are more likely to develop severe myocardial and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of the deaths of patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be associated with ACE2-positive hollangiocytes, which could result in liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are closely interrelated and can distort results.
Deviations detected in laboratory studies: the level of the C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered a potential prognostic factor in the flow of disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between the C-reactive protein level, the degree of severity of the disease and the forecast at COVID-19 should be taken into account.
In addition, high levels of lactatidehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine may also be predicted.
These enzymes are highly secreted by different organs, especially the heart and the liver, and are released when the tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
The main clinical symptoms: to predict the results and complications of treatment with COVID-19, along with other factors, should take into account data from the X-ray study of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
The use of steroids: steroids, as described above, have been the hallucinators of immunity widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
As corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS forms, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis that resulted in lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be administered in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the death of their relatives and other patients.
Psychological advice and long-term support must be undertaken to help such patients recover from stress.
According to current demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or cause no symptoms at all at the early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have an early disease or have not yet completed an incubation period may spread the virus to a significant extent, making epidemiological monitoring difficult.
However, it was considered that the transfer of the SARS-CoV virus occurred when patients were severely ill, in most cases not at the early stage of infection.
Thus, today ' s COVID-19 epidemic is a much more serious SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
Great work is currently under way in China to declare a general quarantine in Uhan and neighbouring cities, as well as to extend the quarantine regime for virtually all the population introduced to stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus proliferation chain.
While these measures are extremely damaging to the economy and other areas of the country ' s life, the number of newly identified patients is declining, suggesting a slowdown in the rate of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of disease will end by March and the phase of inhalation will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues said that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looked far more contagious than the SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the team headed by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could hit two thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian Team of Specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been detected in nose and throat strokes taken from patients who had recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the current strategy may have taken effect.
According to initial projections, Ebola fever was expected to kill up to a million people and cause half a million patients to die.
But with severe quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to control itself.
It is likely that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the virus that infects the SARS-CoV-2 virus can weaken and will eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexistant with a human being.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through a cough or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with contaminated material.
The virus was also detected in the faucet, which means that an oral-perfect mode of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of 138 cases may have resulted from infections in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously diagnosed diseases and 40 persons in the hospital.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders, who contact patients or are infected.
The first line of defence in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the person; and surgical masks, and respirators of Class N95 (Series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not give microcaples liquids from potentially infected to fly in the air and sit on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the environment.
However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860s) can protect from inhaling virions of 10 to 80 nm, they miss only 5 % of the virions; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can even penetrate five surgical masks combined, medical professionals directly contact patients must wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear a protective robe that is caught up in the figure in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
The viruses can also get into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95-class mask; perhaps the virus got into his body through the eyes of the inflamed.
Therefore, health professionals should also wear transparent face-plates or protective glasses of the closed type.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently by disinfectants, to avoid leaving the house by self-inclusion, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
The distance acceptable to the patient is considered to be about a meter apart.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus had not been previously known to humanity, its high degree of similarity with the SARS-CoV reported on 7 January 2020 should have been an alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it had gained during the SARS flash in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020 did the Director of the Centre for Disease Control, Uhan, reassure the citizens, informing them that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproduction when transferring from person to person, and that preventing the spread and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing to celebrate the New Year of China, and a critical time was lost when the disease could be contained within Mr. Uhan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this profound lesson and in the future make significant improvements.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since every word is taken into account by citizens and can influence their attitude and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information from the clinic than to wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain the potential epidemic in its early stages of development rather than to appease the public; and (4) conduct more focused and effective exercises to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and the regular verification and improvement of the social response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by an previously unexplored coronavirus of severe type 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease covered the whole of China and, at the time of writing, it spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 occurred with a relapse of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, significant in terms of the control of the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons to a greater extent than young people and men to a greater extent than women; the proportion of serious cases and deaths among older persons is also higher than among young people.
The mortality from SARS is higher than for COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared with 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in the absence of a symptom of disease, while patients with SARS usually only in severe cases of disease, so it is more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 is spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, treated patients may again show positive samples for the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Against the backdrop of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 per cent homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses of bats, we still cannot claim that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 occurred from bats.
What kind of animal became the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as from bats to human?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transfer path, and the epidemiological situation may increase at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to AC2, but how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and provoke subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also related to ACE2 producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long is the epidemic going to last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of transferring from person to person?
Would it cause the world pandemic, disappear as well as SARS, or periodically recuperate such flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to return to normal life.
Zoonological Origins of Human Coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-generation of co-ronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for thousands of years.
Up to 2003, it was known that two human coronavirus (HCoV) caused a slight disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening an infection can be caused by human coronavirus.
The emergence of severe severe type 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 again attracted attention to coronaviruses and surprised us by the high transmission capacity, but less pronounced pathogen of the virus than the SARS-CoV.
The coronavirus infection of man is a zoonosis, and understanding of its zoonological origin will be very useful.
Most of the coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoirs of certain human coronaviruses are also known.
The identification of animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
The study of interaction between animals that carry coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we refer to the available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origin and interspecies.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses with respect to viral evolution and genome recombinant species.
In this context, the current epidemic of a disease caused by a coronavirus discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being addressed.
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease flow are noted.
Coronaviruses are related to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar RNA.
These viruses, with the largest of the RNA virus-containing genomes containing between 26 and 32,000 nucleotide, have been named because of their form, which, when examined by an electronic microscope, resembles the crown.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain non-segmental genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open overlaps (ORF1a and ORRF1b) that are broadcast to the replicating polyproteins of pp1a and pp1b.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including spicy protein (S), cloudy protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronavirus have also encoded a number of specific accessory proteins.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma and deltaconaviruses), with the type of betaconavirus containing the majority of human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is philosophical evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and beta-conaviruses is volatile mice and rodents, whereas birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-conaviruses.
The thousands of coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some have evolved to human-threatening pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betaconaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of type 2 SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of light form, such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
Unlike them, SARS-CoV viruses, MERS-CoV and newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in relatively higher numbers of patients with a higher chance of developing acute respiratory disease (ORZ) and inflammatory symptoms.
The first human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814 was derived from a sample of patients with cold disease who were separated from the nostrils in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has resulted in more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which have caused symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that contamination by human coronavirus was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
The newly diagnosed human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives as of 3 March 2020, and the number of people infected exceeded 91,000.
An alarming signal has been received, and the world must be prepared for the future SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have zoonotic origins; their sources are bats, mice, or pets.
Numerous datasets have demonstrated the evolution of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, where viruses have been well adapted to organisms with no pathogenic properties but have demonstrated broad genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic left China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
A study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will help to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecies.
It may also indicate or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the spread of the disease in the future.
The review provides an overview of the zoonotic origin, interspecies and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we refer to and consider the following general feature: the source viruses from which human coronaviruses have occurred are not usually pathogenic to their reservoirs, but acquire pathogens after interspecies transfer to the new carrier.
We also analyse the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transferability is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogen properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 flash is also considered.
The coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first obtained from a sample of patients with cold diseases, various coronaviruses were found in different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides an informative and observatory of the short history of the discovery of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory pathways of patients with infectious upper respiratory pathways in 1966; the virus was subsequently adapted to the reproduction of WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general soreness and pain in the throat, with high temperatures and coughs occurring in 10-20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was selected from an organic culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of the pine mice.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E, which are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathway pathogens, such as Type A influenza viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are widespread worldwide and are commonly transmitted in moderate latitudes in wintertime.
Mostly, the incubation period of the two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to the results of the volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a simple cold form.
Few patients with impaired immunity experienced severe infections of lower respiratory tracts.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the epidemic of atypical pneumonia, has been the first well documented pandemic in all human history, caused by the coronavirus, and the disease has led to the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coronaviruses.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in Guandun Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and disease spread in many countries and across continents.
Without regard to hyperactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could infect approximately two others; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days and the peak of viral load was 10 days.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headaches, high temperature, general indigestion and osteoporosis, while later symptoms included swelling, cough and respiratory failure.
The laboratory deviations from the SAMS standard are lymphopia, liver sample disorders and elevated creatinine levels.
Patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophages.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients are subsequently in need of intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such difficult cases, other organs, including organs of the gastric tract, liver and kidney, which are usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be lethal, especially for patients with reduced immunity, may also be infected in addition to lower respiratory tracts.
For the first time, the virus was released from an open biopsy by a mild relative of the patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to research human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it primarily affected children of younger age, elderly people and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
HCoV-NL63 is characterized by such manifestations as dizziness, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchialitis.
Another independent study described the same virus from the nasal material taken from an eight-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it is widespread.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peaks of disease caused by them are at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, which is also called a circle.
HCoV-HKU1 was granted in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old male hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to extra-patient pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 have exhibited light form respiratory diseases worldwide.
All of these four coronaviruses that cause extrabolic infections were well adapted to humans, and their mutations resulting in highly pathogenic diseases were generally unlikely, although their causes were not known, as a rare example of a more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, caused a serious infection of the lower respiratory pathways in China.
Usually, by gaining the ability to transmit effectively and to remain in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
The Coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a slightly 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases took place in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there have been cases of forced entry and distribution through sporadic secondary infections with close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), both of which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed severe renal insufficiency, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronaviruses that are passed on to humans.
More than 30 per cent of patients have stomach and intestine symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of high-death Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4%) were reported, and thus MERS-CoV was considered one of the most lethal viruses known to man.
From mid-December 2019 to the end of 2019, patients with pneumonia have been identified in Uhan of the Chinese province of Hubay, which is now being linked to the infection caused by the coronavirus of severe type 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been called a “coronavir infection 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were recorded worldwide, with mortality of approximately 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in Hubey Province of China is 4.2 per cent and that it is 1.2 per cent outside.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronavirus, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough and exposure.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses, however, form different branches of the philogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater ability to transfer than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of non-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been recorded, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly throughout the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronaviruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, the coronaviruses transmitted to a person have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the remaining six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses that cause extra-patient infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections is similar to that most commonly observed when infected by human coronaviruses that cause extra-patient infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 may be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also notes the interesting patterns characteristic of both human coronaviruses that cause extra-patient infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronaviruses that cause extra-patient infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transfer of the virus (i.e. infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause extrabolic infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in faeces.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as important (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause extra-patient infections.
Nevertheless, the future development of the continuing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transferability, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human transition.
All four human coronavirus infections with symptoms of mild form were well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it may have been people who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of the pandemics of human coronaviruses in the past.
Human coronaviruses, which cause serious diseases in humans, and people with severe diseases, human coronaviruses, have simply not survived.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in the human body to the extent necessary for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the carrier's limitation factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is prolonged and the more people will be infected, the more likely the virus is fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult for people to stop it by quarantine or other communicable disease control activities.
For many years, four outpatient coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, which are common colds in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reserve animal.
High-potential coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transfer to humans cannot be supported.
They need to be preserved and reproduced in their zoonological reservoirs and to search for receptive human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or reinforcing carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV extrabolic viruses.
It's very easy to transmit as extra-patient HCoV, at least at present.
But it's more pathogenic than the extrabolic HCoV and less pathogenic than the SARS-CoV or the MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts fully to the human being and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, we will be useful in discussing definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, reinforcing and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a nearby ancestor with the same high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestry virus is usually well adapted and non-patogenic in that medium.
Similarly, HCoV is constantly transporting the reservoir over a long period of time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into the intermediate carrier immediately before or around the time when it was carried out, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonological source of human infection and play the role of an accelerant carrier, allowing the virus to replicate and then transmit it to people by increasing the extent of human infection.
HCoV may carry a dead end infection if it cannot withstand the transfer inside the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also be adapted to the intermediate carrier and can even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that a zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals (kids).
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies in animals against the SARS-CoV virus is higher than that of the population as a whole.
The Himalayan civities (Paguma larvata) and the anatomical dog in the live animal markets were the first established virus carriers such as and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that no more SARS cases were reported in the markets after the destruction of all civilians.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan civilians living in the wild or on farms and not in the markets were, in most cases, not determined, which leads to the conclusion that the Himalayan civilians could only serve as an intermediate amplifier rather than a natural SARS-CoV tank.
Significantly, as 80 per cent of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be excluded that intermediate boosters can also serve many types of mammals.
They all seem like deadweight carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
The subsequent search of the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV revealed a nearby CoV of bats, which was called the atypical pneumonia associated with the coronavirus of the HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), and which is present with Chinese horseshoe bats.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the gene sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses have the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV for 88 to 92 per cent.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats became carriers of new human pathogens.
A number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in bats, but none other than one that denotes WIV1 cannot be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It has been shown that WIV1 obtained from the test of bat faeces uses ACE2 bats, cybians and humans as receptors for entering the cell.
Curiously, the serum of healing patients with SARS may have neutralized the WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, dividing 95 per cent of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not a direct reserve carrier of SARS-CoV.
Filogenetic analysis refers to MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus are closer to the sequences of betaconavirus with volatile mice detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats haven't found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The homologies of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative to CoV-HKU25 are only 87 per cent of bats.
So flying mice might not be the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East has shown that single-armed camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as to Middle East camels in many African countries.
A living MERS-CoV virus, identical to that found in humans, has been removed from the nasal dabs of single-armed camels, which further confirms the role of camels as genuine tank bearers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels infected with MERS-CoV experienced minor symptoms, but massive viral transmission.
It is remarkable that infected camels have secreted the virus not only as a respiratory route but also as a fecal-oral path, which is also the main way to release the virus from bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have not been in contact with camels in the history before the onset of symptoms and are likely to refer to human transmission or to unknown channels, including undetermined animal species that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The homology of nucleotide SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% consistent with the CoV RaTG13 of bats assigned to the Asian horseshoes of Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the diversification of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RAG13 is too large to attribute parental relations to them.
That is, flying mice could and would not be a direct reserve carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless the almost identical coronaviruses of bats were found in the future.
Presumably, the direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus must be among the wild species sold and killed in the hazy wholesale market of marine products with which many initial cases of COVID-19 were related, which suggests that the animal is likely to be transferred from the animal.
Several recent metagenological sequencing studies have concluded that the group at risk of the destruction of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis Javanica) could also carry parent betaconavirus, the parent strain SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolins coronaviruses is 85-92% consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with the identity of about 90% of the nucleotide sequences.
They are classified in two sub-referentials of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in a philogenetic tree, one of which has a binding domain (RD) receptor closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
On the contrary, RSD strains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more discriminating, despite the higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
In an earlier study of sick pangolins, it was also reported that viral contagions were identified in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to obtain a sequence of the genome, comprising about 86.3 per cent of the complete viral genome.
The possibility that pangolin has become one of the intermediate animals of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.
However, due to the diversification of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin betaconaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RAG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronaviruses of pangolins associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet established for bats, pangolins and other mammals.
Whereas the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-conservaviruses of pangolins, related SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RAG13, the highest sequence homology within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the pangolin betas, the parent SARS-CoV-2, and the SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal favours the recombination of the beta-cononavirus pangolin, the native SARS-CoV-2, and the RAG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betaconaviruses.
There is no final decision on the direct zoonoses of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to HCoV highly pathogenic viruses, the zoonological origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Filogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can occur from the coronaviruses of bats, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains are detected from rodents.
It was reported that the coronavirus of bats called ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and discovered by the North American three-colored pendulum showed close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another coronavirus known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier might have been camels.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the origin of the known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of events of interspecies transmission of HCoV in the history.
When the HCoV-OC43 virus was transmitted by an interspecies of about 1890 and people were infected by domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alpharonaviruses of volatile mice, close to HCoV-229E have been detected.
There is an alpaca alpaca alkronavirus between them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to bats.
First, it was people, not alpaca, who could contact bats in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpaca.
Secondly, the alpha-coronaviruses of bats, related HCoV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-cononavirus has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alphacononavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be excluded that the alpaca received an alphacononavirus of HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while alpha-contaminants of bats could serve as a gene bullet to the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and single-armed camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV provides a fine example of interspecies transmission from flying mice to camels and from single-armed camels to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known for its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viruses for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly make flying mice “ideal spreaders”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to a single camel a decade ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have become a stable and natural reservoir carrier from the intermediate carrier.
These animals have a very light disease caused by MERS-CoV and have relatively low mutation rates.
Its occasional transfer to a person is an accident, and the person remains a deadlock bearer of MERS-CoV, as the transfer is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transfer of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, pangolin betaconaviruses are highly pathogenic in the pangolins.
They can be deadlocked carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civilians in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities for interspecies transfer of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals must be confirmed or excluded.
First, flying mice can be a reservoir for a virus related SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share ecological niches with bats because of the obscenity or separation of carcases of these animals.
Secondly, pangolins may be one of the intermediate boosters in which the native SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been infected.
People get infected with the virus by cutting the carcases and eating wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
The pet and wild animal survey on antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could take place in the third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to different animal species, the three main factors on the part of the viruses have also contributed to the cross-species.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in the RNA replication.
Compared to other viruses with a single-chain RNA, the calculated frequency of Coronavirus mutations can be considered to be “moderate-high” with an average rate of approximately 10 to 4 replacements per year at one section of 2 depending on the phase of adapting the coronavirus to new owners.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, whose removal results in an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even incapacitability.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue, Remdesivire, embodies the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
Remdesivire is one of the most promising means against SARS-CoV-2, which should be checked during clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost one million times higher than that of their carriers.
Furthermore, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to the SARS-CoV with the high frequency of mutations, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is clearly below, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already been adapted to another near-human carrier.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well adapted to single-arm camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that vaccines and antivirals from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of the genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA gene in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in the genomic modification of mutations and recombinants, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspecies favourable to the emergence of new coronaviruses, subject to conditions.
This contributes to the many unique open reading frameworks and functions of proteins encoded in the direction of the 3′-conclusion genome.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses accidentally and frequently switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcripation of the coronavirus’s DNA in the carrier, which serves as a mixed receptacle, there is often a change in the uterus.
High-level full and sub-genemic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
In both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal coronaviruses, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats, the phenogenetic evidence of natural recombinant recombination was found.
Interaction of the carrier virus with regard to transfer
In addition to the three Virus Factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor important for interspecies transmission.
This article provides a typical example, which also demonstrates positive selection in interspecies transmission events, and a recombination of SARS-CoV.
Based on a comparative analysis between the SARS-CoV strains of humans and civilians, SARS-CoV is considered to be undergoing rapid adaptation in various media, especially with regard to RSD mutations of protein S.
In general, the S coronavirus RSD is interacting with the cell receptor, and the carrier antibody response is intensively picking it up.
SARS-CoV RSDs are amino acids, from 318th to 510th, on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its correceptors for the introduction of the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD is capable of identifying APF2 receptors of different animals, including bats, civets, mice and anemone dogs, making it possible to transfer the virus intervidally.
In fact, only 6 amino acids were found in the RSD, which differ from human viral strains and civets, of which 4 are in the receptor-binding reason for interacting with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets have K479N and S487T mutations in the RSD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the broadband protein with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two substitute amino acids can be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in segment S1 protein S leads to a change in the binding affinity of S protein to human APF2.
Indeed, a Cryoelectronic microscope study says that the affinity of this relationship is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 and S virus SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other corridors were needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCoV-NL63 is also associated with APF2, but with another segment of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsalicylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in people after interspecies transfer from animal to animal.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecies transmission HCoV is also controlled by other factors of dependence and limitation of the carrier.
Divergence of these human carrying proteins and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, single-armed camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
The success of interspecies transfer to HCoVs requires that dependency factors and subduing the wearer restriction factors be taken up.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the bearer still need identification and categorization.
Good results can be achieved by impartial full-fledged screening of dependency and restraint factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
Creation of new HCoV: back to zero
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides a wide range of opportunities for new HCoVs.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombinants are also the driving force of HCoV evolution and serve as two important stages in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coded genes has the potential to radically modify phenotypes of viruses.
Among the SARS-CoV accelerant proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adapting to humans because the virus of bats related to SARS-CoV has been isolated, but it has been established that they are coded ORF8.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide distribution was found, which is characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses.
This delegation breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is regarded as an adaptive mutation that accelerates the replacement of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinants with alpha and gammaconavirus lines where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The localization of recombinants was also determined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV was exposed to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-rby camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs, where HCoV was recombined with other animal coronaviruses in its non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from the release of the virus from migratory pressures such as the immune system of the bearer.
An example of such effects is the loss of the full ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain through the 2-nucleotide distribution.
While an explicit ORF4 reading framework can be observed in the virus of bats and camels related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alphaconavirus displays a single nucleotide cartridge, leading to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCVs is also due to the pressure to select on their reservoir carriers.
Infecting bats with coronaviruses, slight symptoms or lack of them were reported, indicating a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the aprejudication of the NKG2/CD94 natural cell inhibitor receptor and the low level of expression of the molecules of the main class I hystosmosity complex.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen form, which is ensured by high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus while at the same time affecting the reading of exorribonuclease, thus creating pressure to select for the generation of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when entering the new medium.
The more pathogenic strains of coronavirus may also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or proteins to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged over the past 20 years.
Coronaviruses are either non-patogenic or have mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They are definitely replicated without causing a strong immune response from the bearer.
This is the secret of why we see unsymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly related to the hyperactivation of immune response and cytokine storms, where the stronger the immune response, the more likely the loss of the lungs.
On the contrary, the immune response from unsymptomless carriers does not involve the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response failure strategy may have favourable effects with therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
In bats, there is a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, type I interferon should have a beneficial effect at least in the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammas is impaired by bats.
Based on this inhibition of NLRP3-inflammase with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common pattern, followed by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While betaconavirus was found with bat bat bats, whose nucleotide homology is 95 per cent consistent with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of bats, whose nucleotide homology is 96 per cent consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was discovered that the viruses identical to SARS-CoV carried civilians and other animals in the markets, the intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 were not immediately installed.
Betaconaviruses of the pangolin, surprisingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, have been detected, suggesting that pangolins could serve as intermediate carriers or that fragments of pangolin betaconavirus genes could enter the final version of the SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no indication that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by a human being.
The coronaviruses have received general attention because of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV animal reservoirs in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 occur from bats and have been passed on to man through intermediate carriers.
If the SARS-CoV infection occurs from contact between people and civilians in the markets, closure of the wild markets and destruction of civilians could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of various lines of the beta-conocornonviruses of the pangolins, near-born SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed to prevent the zoonological transmission of infection from the food markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is passed on to a person through pangolins and other mammals, and how this may continue to be the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-armed camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the wild animals markets of China to prevent the proliferation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
An integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other communicable control measures, in order to stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can occur that cause outbreaks of disease.
Various zoonological coronaviruses are circulating around the world.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There is a great deal of opportunity for the evolution and recombinantization of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and (or) more lethal to humans.
In order to reduce the number of unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After severe tests, such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be seized.
Although many properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
In order to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural bearers, continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals and future outbreaks of disease.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the environmental niches of natural zoonological viruses.
Some fragments are still missing in the puzzle of zoonotic origin SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the bats passed the ancestral virus SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances the flying mice and pangolins share the same environmental niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate carrier is played by a third mammal, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and pilot infection should be conducted.
Whether a floating mouse, pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified by their natural bearers.
Further research in this area sheds light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria need to be updated for “suspecting cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief handbook on the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides an overview of our experience and provides reliable recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronaviral infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Committee on Health of the PRC.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now known as the coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), was launched and the virus disease itself was called the “heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the infection of SARS-CoV-2, our group has developed a short guidebook and published it on the Internet on the website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication has attracted great attention.
It should be noted, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been gradually enhanced on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven issues of the document “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19”, published by the National Committee on Health of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), some of its provisions have changed significantly.
The work recently carried out by Zhou (Zhou) and the co-sponsors provided comments on our recommendations, which contained simple diagnostic proposals based on existing clinical experience.
This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on the pandemic that covered the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19 (tested 7th version) and current studies, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh edition of this document (March 3, 2020), a single element of epidemiological history must be combined with two clinical manifestations of disease in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the case of suspected disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movement or residence in Uhan and its surroundings or other settlements where cases of COVID-19 were recorded for 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) the history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive test based on nucleic acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its surroundings or other human settlements where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases ( 2 cases with high temperatures or respiratory symptoms recorded for 2 weeks on small areas such as home or apartment, office, class in school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external signs of COVID-19 infection; (3) total leukocytes are normal or decreased with reduced lymphocytes at an early stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed disease should be based on suspicion of disease with one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) real-time CCD test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-gen sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity for new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies specific to IgM and IgG; or a change in the result of a test negative to SARS-CoV-2 antibody-specific for IgG, or an increase in titres at least 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the relevant acute phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) issues of the document, a real-time PCR test was added for nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples.
The pathogenetic blood test diagnosis was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then in the seventh issue, the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the results of continuous work by researchers in the search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples from the respiratory pathways, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in disease confirmation criteria.
However, there is growing evidence of the need to exercise caution in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in Zhou (Zhou) and others should be updated as it identifies persons with no clinical symptoms as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we will note that we hope to obtain more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and implement strictly the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 — daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the largest number of deaths from the virus every day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home, were among the reported infections.
The total was 17 deaths.
In the online briefing, Director of IEDCR, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, said that four men and one woman had been killed.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two people were aged over 60, two were between 51 and 60 and one were between 41 and 50.
She also reported that the two victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic officer informed the local news agency Anadolu that Jalal Sayfur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was one of the victims, who was being treated at the Kuwait Clinic of Maitri.
On Saturday, the Minister for Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obajyl Kwader, said that public transport would be terminated for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport had been suspended since 26 March and was due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods — medicines, fuel and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March by two persons who returned from Italy and one of them had a wife.
As of 19 March, these three people had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded the millions of infections worldwide
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, on Thursday, the total number of coronary infection cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52 thousand people were killed by COVID-19 coronavirus.
The crossover came on the same day as the first infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of coronavirus death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries that had not recorded cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 a.m. in Central European Time (8,800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News referring to data from Johns Hopkins University reported that more than 1,000 deaths were reported in the United States on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tightening measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobjanin, extended the self-insulation regime for citizens of the city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that Russians throughout the country, despite self-inclusion, would be paid up to 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of the extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote was 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the curfew had been extended only from 3 hours a day to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to enter curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 am.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the state's domestic isolation regime had been extended until 1 May.
Stores in Australia limit the quantity of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian networks of Woolworths and Colees reduced the number of toilet paper packages that could be purchased once in all the country's shops to two and one package respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions have been reported in cash announcements as well as on the Facebook web page.
Citizens were reportedly beginning to make emergency supplies because of the fear that COVID-19 might lead to the introduction of a general isolation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Colees had already limited this quantity to 4 packages.
In its press release of 8 March, the Coles trading network reported that, with the introduction of a restriction on four packages, “in many shops, toilet paper is still bought too quickly — one shipment within an hour” and called such demand “unprecedented”, while ALDI in a Facebook post published on Tuesday called the “unforeseen” trend.
According to the representative Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco store in Canberra also limited this amount to two packages last week.
In order to fill the deficit, Colees began ordering more large shipments from suppliers and increasing the supply rate, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for a special stock of early sales by Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Rising Association, reported that the trailers were trying to replenish their stocks, but this was hampered by the restrictions of local authorities on the timetable for trucking.
It looks forward to increasing the cost of products, as suppliers are trying to meet demand, but less and less profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to stockpile depletion, some stores were unable to carry out Wednesdays.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert at retail trade at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores replenish stores every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so the quantity of stockpiles was low, and after the sale of the whole goods, long ranks of shelves remained empty, increasing the sense of shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably would not be panicking”, said Russell Zimmerman.
On the past Wednesday, the manufacturer of processed toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported the end of the stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent products, reported that they were working round the clock to ensure a sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased due to the lack of buyers for the week of Labour Day, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders of auctions.
The fourth issue of the daily NT News printed in Darwin included a tab of eight pages for cutting and use as toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of 3 March, shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, stating that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also use increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, galatheria, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening, it was observed that the online store of Britain's Ocado also restricted the sale of Andres toilet paper by 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemy” only describes the extent of the disease and not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic”.
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, monitor the occurrence of the disease and mobilize their citizens,” explained Mr. Tedros Adana Gerreiss, Director-General of WHO.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming levels of disease and the alarming levels of inaction”.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He said in his interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than influenza has been monitored since its emergence until its continued global spread”.
Mr. Gerreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never observed a pandemic caused by coronavirus.
We have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of the disease to be an emergency in the field of public health of international importance and then granted it a new pandemic status.
Dr. Anthony Fauchi, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, replied: “This is only the beginning; it will be worse.”
According to Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were recorded on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The pandemic of coronavirus 2019-2020 is a currently occurring pandemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhan, China, in December 2019 and the emergency international public health situation was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and regions, killing some 97,000 people.
About 364,000 people recovered.
China ' s mortality rate is 4 per cent, while it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first occurrence of symptoms to peaks is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment has now been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive; the recommended preventive measures include hand washing, mouth covering in the cough, respect for human distance, detection and self-inclusion of persons suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closures.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or abolition of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, and a widespread shortage of goods exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
There have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people who resemble them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of virus proliferation have been noted.
The reduction in the number of trips and closures of heavy industry has resulted in lower air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in the town of Uhan (the capital of Hubay Province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with unknown cause and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases of infection were mainly related to the wholesale market of Juanan marine products, so the virus is believed to have zoonotic origin.
The virus, which caused the outbreak, is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that was very similar to the coronaviruses of flying mice, the coronaviruses of the Pangolin, and the SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease had occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the infected one had not visited the market since that date.
Two thirds of the infections recorded in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of the South China office of the Journal of Morning Post, which was not verified, suggested that the first case of infection occurred with the 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had declined but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China had first exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly underestimated, inter alia, because of the number of cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection among young people were reported, with patients aged 19 years and younger being less than 2.4 per cent worldwide, according to the Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallans, who estimated that 60% of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established among the population.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested by COVID-19 and whose test has proved positive under official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, formal policies had been adopted that did not require testing for only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China before 23 January, and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of the reported cases.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases recorded.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive infection number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 recover well.
In other, more complex cases, from the onset of symptoms to the time of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent was 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, some 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over the age of 60 and 75 per cent of those killed had associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official figures may not take into account dead people who have not passed tests — for example, in the case of death at home, in the elderly homes, etc.
Italy ' s incomplete data show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID rates by 4 to 5 times.
The Spokesperson of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is below actual.” His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S.; this is often seen in pandemics such as the H1N1 virus. The first confirmed death was recorded in U.S. on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and, outside Asia, on 14 February in France.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents, other than Antarctica, had reported deaths, and several methods had been used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and the time when the disease is spreading; they are also influenced by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems used by treatment schemes, the time from the onset of outbreaks of disease and the population, such as age, gender and general health; the mortality/infectiousness factor represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed during the specified period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the rate of mortality to morbidity decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those who had symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who had symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the mortality rate due to disease (CFR), the percentage of diagnosed patients who died from the disease, and the rate of death from infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain groups of the population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
According to estimates from the Center for Evidence Medicine at Oxford University, the mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The top figure of this range is consistent with the first random COVID-19 testing in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash shall not be identifiable and may vary according to location.
Macei Boni, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrollable infectious outbreaks usually go on a plateau, and then, when the number of available disease carriers ends, they start to go out.
In the current situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.”
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Zhong Nanshan, argues that “everything can end by June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations for measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will be circulating, perhaps within a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more) is created, compliance with physical distance measures and other measures will be required.
William Shafner, a member of the Vanderbilt University, believes: “I don’t think this coronavirus will ever disappear at all, because it’s so easily transmitted,” and that it “can become a seasonal disease that erupts every year”.
The virtuality of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some people infected may undergo disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in the respiratory tract (scraping), loss of sense of smell, swelling, pain in muscles and joints, pain in the throat, headache, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that it is serious with the development of breathing problems of about 1 in 6 people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list such urgent symptoms as difficulty in breathing, constant pain or feeling depressed in the chest, sudden feeling of confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening and sleepiness of the person or lips. If these symptoms occur, urgent medical attention should be sought. Further development of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected persons may experience a disease without any clinical evidence, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, and doctors recommend that patients in close contact with patients who are diagnosed with a confirmed diagnosis should be placed under strict supervision and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of unsymptomless cases varies from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) fluctuates from one to 14 days; it usually lasts for five days; so far, there is no complete clarity on the symptoms of loss of breath: according to initial estimates, the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom was initially 30% and then fell to 15%.
Some details of the means of spreading the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small droplets that are released into the air together with cough, sneezing or talking; close contact involves contact within a radius of between 1 and 2 metres (between 3 and 6 feet).
According to some studies, droplets can range from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets released into the air during a conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods. Respiratory drops can also be formed during rest, including during conversation, although the virus is usually not carried by air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary resuscitation (CVS), may lead to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if the person is concerned with the contaminated surface, including the skin, with subsequent contact with his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered to be low.
The Chinese Government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infected within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although it may occur both before symptoms and at a later stage of the disease occur.
There have been cases in which the tests were positive three days before the symptoms occurred, and this suggests the possibility of transmitting the virus to an express symptom.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of unsymptomless disease, but some countries have also identified cases of transmission of disease from unsymptomable carriers.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not yet quite clear how easily the virus is spread, but it is known that one patient is normally infected by 2 to 3 other people; the virus is able to survive on the surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus was able to live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day, and on copper surfaces for up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that might be touched by infected people.
Severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first discovered by three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the nature of the parent coronavirus, and outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with soap that dissolves its protective shell.
He's supposed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a species of Sarbevirus (cellline B) together with two other strains of bat mouse viruses.
At a holistic and bionomic level, 96 per cent is identical to other samples of coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acid in certain parts of the sequences of the pangolin and human genome.
A fully-genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92 per cent) is between the coronavirus of the Pangolin and the SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate Virus owners.
The virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by an analysis of a polymerase chain reaction with a reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of an infected secret or computer tomography.
A study comparing CPD and CTC methods used in Uhan showed that the CTC was much more sensitive than the CCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease-related processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has published the recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a test method for testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnostics”.
WHO published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is performed.
It can be performed on respiratory and blood samples.
The results are usually completed over a period of several hours to several days.
The test is usually used with a nose brush, although it can also be used with a zebe brush. A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been accurate enough to obtain universal approval.
In the United States, the Cellex serological test was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic features of visualizing the symptoms of X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral mutants of the type of matte glass and absence of pleural sweats.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for producing an international database of confirmed cases of contamination.
Because of similarities with other infections, such as adenovvirus, COVID-19 images not confirmed by CCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study was carried out comparing the results of the TC chest and the testing of PCD, and it was clarified that, while the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered more quickly; they were also more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method could be seen as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
For the diagnosis of the virus with X-rays and computer tomography, the development of an artificial-intellectual neuron network was performed.
Prevention strategies include the maintenance of general personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding eye contact, nose or mouth with dirty hands, use in coughing or squeezing of napkins, which should be disposed of immediately after use.
Those who may have been infected should wear a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to distance themselves physically from people, many Governments recommend refraining from any urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus has been able to spread to most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among the population, some members of which do not know where and how it has been infected, medical personnel who care for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with others and eye protection, and monitoring of contacts is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have made statements requiring this type of monitoring.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as at 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on developing solutions to ensure personal data confidentiality, such as the user's proximity to other Bluetooth mobile phones.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he received a notification; there are also groundless versions of how to prevent infection — such as rubbing his nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There are currently no vaccines from COVID-19, although many organizations are working on it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or severely contaminated hands, as well as before meals, after taking a shower, cough or sneezing.
This is necessary, as the virus is destroyed by a domestic soap that opens up its protective shell when it is out of the human body.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to treat hands on a alcohol basis with a alcohol content of not less than 60%.
WHO recommends that people avoid eye contact, nose, or lips with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the stainless steel surface, the disinfectant starts to act one minute after application) containing 62 to 71 per cent ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent iodine vision.
Other components such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion or confirmation of COVID in an institution such as an office or a day-care facility, all premises of such a facility, including offices, toilets, public facilities, electronic equipment such as tabletes, sensors, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations are advised to cover the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or napkin in a cough or sneezing and to immediately dispose of used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, since the use of masks may limit the volume and range of breath products scattered in the air during conversation, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces and touch them with dirty hands is the main means of infection.” Masks are also recommended to use those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those taking care of the person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of masks actually reduces the number of person touchers.
Several countries have begun calling for medical masks in public places.
CDC centres, the United States, recommend wearing non-medical facial masks, and China separately stressed the importance of using disposable medical masks with healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 m (3 ft) or less) with other people.
It is recommended that Hong Kong wear a medical mask in public transport or in human places.
Thai health officials have called on people to make and wipe masks on a daily basis.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going outside without masks closing their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government has obliged all visitors to the grocery store to wear medical masks.
The Israeli Government has also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where ten million medical masks per day have been produced since mid-March, medical masks have been ordered for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask on the street, and those who could not acquire masks were advised to sew them themselves under domestic conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat infection, aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures while staying at home, restricting travel by avoiding people's places, using uninvited greetings and physically distanced from others.
Many Governments in the regions, especially those severely affected by the outbreak, currently prescribe or recommend social distances.
The maximum number of people who can meet in one place, as recommended by the U.S. Government and health organizations, was rapidly reduced from 250 people (in regions where there were no data on the dissemination of COVID-19), to 50 and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned groups involving more than two people: older people and people suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of serious disease. CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if the region is experiencing an outbreak of disease. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance”, thus specifying the purpose of the measure by reducing physical contact within the framework of social relations, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be completely socially excluded rather than in contact with other people in alternative ways; some agencies had published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among others, it has been recommended that you enter into sexual relations only with your permanent partners, and you are confident that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected were advised to self-insulated in domestic conditions.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions on proper self-determination, and many Governments have also imposed mandatory or recommended that all populations of affected areas themselves be quarantined.
High-risk individuals were prescribed a stricter quarantine.
Persons who may have been in contact with infected COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region affected to a large extent by the epidemic were recommended to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat outbreaks include the control of the spread of the disease, its suppression or mitigation.
The disease is contained in the early stages and is intended to track and isolate the infected, as well as other communicable control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease may be taken simultaneously.
The suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections below 1. Part of the efforts to manage the outbreak of infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the equalization of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overcrowded health services and give more time to develop vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks and self-insulation; public measures aimed at physical distances, such as school closures and the abolition of mass activities; community involvement in the implementation and participation of such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning; and since the seriousness of the outbreak became apparent in China, more determined action has been taken to contain outbreaks such as urban isolation and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
A mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced in South Korea, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to self-insulated infected persons and fines for those who had not done so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and fines for the accumulation of surplus medications has increased. British and U.S. drug modelling has shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (deceleration, but not halting the spread of the epidemic) and depression (reducing the increase in the epidemic).
An optimal disease mitigation policy can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3 and double mortality, but it can still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapses of health systems.
Pressure may be preferable, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates to the population (or until a vaccine has been developed if sooner) because otherwise the disease will be rapidly reinstated when measures are weakened.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have resulted in social and economic costs.
Antiviral drugs approved for treatment with COVID-19 are currently not available, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking non-receptive medicines from cold, drinking enough fluid and rest can help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and respiratory support.
The use of steroid drugs can only be harmful.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic remedies” could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers improving the capacity and adaptation of health to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the main response to outbreaks.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to assist in the reallocation of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for testing at COVID-19, the lifting of urgent procedures, where possible, the detection of the virus and isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as the enhancement of the ability of intensive therapy through training of staff and the increase in the availability of IWL and caps.
There are various theories as to where the first case of infection — the so-called “zero patient” — might have occurred.
The first known case of infection of a new coronavirus infection may have occurred on 1 December 2019 in Uhan Province of Hubay, China.
During the month, the number of coronavirus infections in Hubay Province gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the wholesale market of marine products of Juan, which also sold live animals, and one theory was that the virus penetrated into the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus had zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a massive disease of unknown origin was reported in the Hubey Clinic, with which a doctor, Zhang Tianjin, had worked, on 27 December, at the Jiang Khan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Uhan City.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at the central clinic in Uhan City warned their colleagues about a “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlan, were warned by the police about the responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ay Fen, got excused from her superiors for panicking.
Later, on 31 December, the Urban Health Commission of Uzhanja issued a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
The Ukhania health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January; at early stages, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by Chinese New Year's celebrations and the fact that Uhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, by 20 January 2020, the symptoms of the disease had already spread to 6,174 people, and as at 26 March, the United States had over 1.61 million cases of infection had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had been killed and more than 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of contamination.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area had restricted their free movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory home accommodation, compulsory shelter or isolation), and curfews, as at 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in any form quarantine, more than 50 million are in the Philippines, about 59 million are in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure increased to 2.6 billion people — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Uhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report that was not verified, this date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jisian worked with an unknown type of pneumonia in the case of a massive disease, and on 27 December her clinic was notified to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the town of Uhan.
The initial genetic testing of samples of patients taking place on 27 December 2019 showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Uhan that they were responsible for “spreading rumors” of outbreaks.
Initially, the National Health Commission of China claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of the ability of the newly discovered virus to transfer from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Si Jingpin of the National War.
The events of the “most large-scale quarantine in the history of mankind” began to unfold, the sanitary border was declared and the entry ban on Uhan and vice versa on 23 January, followed by a total of 15 cities in Hubay Province and affected a total of some 57 million people.
The use of personal transport was prohibited in the city.
On the occasion of the Chinese New Year (25 January), celebrations were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Juochensenchan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenchan, who had received other incoming patients, was subsequently built.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China has also reprofiled 14 other institutions in Uhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government adopted additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health reports to travellers and extending the New Year of China.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and outside Hubay Province.
Public transport schedules have been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
A movement control regime was introduced in many cities and it was estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restrictions on movement in the open air, and after the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, 14 days of mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city. As of 23 March, only one case of intra-country infection was reported in mainland China, which took place five days earlier, in this case from a person returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, China ' s Prime Minister, Lee Katshan, reported that the spread of diseases transmitted domestically had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been controlled.
On the same day, the restrictions on travel to Hubay, except for Uhan, were lifted, two months after the closure of the province of quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of persons with visas or residence permits would be suspended as of 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on enterprises and factories to resume their work and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On 4 April, at 10:00, a national three-minute “minute of silence” was held, which opened a day of torture on the victims of the coronavirus, announced by the Government Council of State and coincided with Quinmin's holiday, but the Central Government asked citizens to pay tribute to those who lost their lives online, while respecting their physical distance to avoid a re-examination of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 was extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease occurring in large quantities because of the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchhongji.
The Shinchhongji followers came to Teghu from Uhan, which is supposed to be the source of the outbreak.
As at 22 February, out of 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported symptoms. South Korea reported the highest level of alarm on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of contamination were reported in Korea, with an increase of up to 3 150 already on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers had confirmed the virus.
The outbreak affected the number of travels, therefore, the schedule of airline flights has been changed. South Korea has launched a screening programme for the presence of the virus, the monitoring of contacts and the organization of quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
The screening methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through mobile applications by all those who came from abroad, the bulk testing of the virus, which was available on the following day, as well as an increase in testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea ' s programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that it did not isolate entire cities, and the South Korean society initially split up because of President Moon Jae Yin ' s reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the actions of the President or called on Mr. Moon to impeach Mr. Moon for an inadequate response by the Government to the outbreak of the disease.
On 23 March, it was reported that the lowest total number of infections per day was recorded in South Korea for four weeks.

Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but that only individuals would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit inter-urban travel, but the intensive movement between cities continued prior to the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrines in Kume remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020 and Iran became a centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
In the face of allegations of concealment of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February more than ten countries had linked cases of their disease to Iran, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak there could be more serious than 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government at that date.
The Iranian Parliament had been closed and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on 3 March, had been positive.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called upon the Iranian prison leadership to release, unconditionally, human rights defenders detained for peaceful thought, as well as to release temporarily all prisoners eligible under this category.
The Organization states that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons where adequate health care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day — the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, Iran had recorded 50 new cases of coronavirus disease every hour and one new death from the coronavirus every ten minutes.
According to the representative of WHO, the rate of morbidity in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also anticipated that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights demanded that economic sanctions be mitigated against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease fell into Italian territory when two Chinese tourists had tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome, with positive results.
The number of cases of contamination has grown rapidly, causing the Italian Government to suspend all flights to China and China and declare a state of emergency.
Later, a non-associated cluster of COVID-19 infections was discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree on the control of outbreaks, according to which more than 50,000 out of 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “The entry and exit of the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, since 100 people had already been killed in Italy at that time.

On 22 March, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery cases, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report noted that this high mortality rate in Italy could be combined with two factors — a large number of older citizens of that country and the lack of ability to survey all those who are currently suffering from coronavirus.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus most calmly from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not responding quickly and seriously to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending refraining from all travels and social contacts that were not of paramount importance by offering people to work from home and avoid public places, such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all recreational facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of the wages paid to the working citizens, but not more than £2,500 per month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced a tighter social distance, prohibiting the gathering of more than two persons and restricting travel and active leisure in the fresh air only in cases of extreme need.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions have been imposed with the involvement of the police, the imposition of fines and the dismantling of human beings.
Most enterprises have been ordered to close, with the exception of enterprises that provide “life activities”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, shops, auto-supply stations and garages.

Despite this, the population testing in the United States was not initiated immediately, and as a result of the true scale of the outbreak, it was hidden during this period.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, by the lack of permission by the Federal Government by the end of February to use non-State test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria prior to the beginning of March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done for the appointment of a treating physician).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted by 13 March.

On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and to contain the spread of infection.
WHO noted the clear differences between the outbreak of atypical pneumonia in 2002-2004, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of collapsing information, allegedly preventing the prevention and control of the disease from spreading, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “has regularly provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of the New Year of China”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban transport in Uhan, WHO representative Hoden Galea noted that, while “the measure was definitely not recommended by WHO”, it was also “a very important confirmation of the obligation to contain the epidemic at the most widespread place”, and called it “an unprecedented in public health history”. On 30 January, after confirming the ability of infection to be passed on from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infections in other countries, WHO declared an emergency situation in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC); this situation became the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first implemented during the swine flu pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, stated that the PHEIC announcement was due to “a global risk of proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries without sound health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade” and that “the WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to allocate $675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “don’t have systems to identify people infected with the virus, although the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest ranks” and called on the international community to “make a choice: to invest today or to pay in the future”. At a press conference on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease — COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, agreed to grant “the potential of the entire United Nations system to respond to the problem”.
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Unit has been established coordinating all United Nations responses; these steps, according to WHO, will “focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to combat the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic manner”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated a joint ad hoc group to assist in addressing the situation within the country and assessing “seriousness and communicable diseases”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of response measures at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of coronavirus, noting that “while it is too early to call it a pandemic, but countries must be ready to do so”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint group to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of a global spread of coronavirus would be increased “high” to “highest — highest levels of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a test of every government in the world to be prepared for the real state of affairs: it is time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready” and stressed that the right responses can help the world avoid “the worst scenario of events”.
Ryan also stated that current data did not serve as a basis for declaring the global pandemic as public health officials, and added that the pandemic announcement would mean that “we are in fact recognizing the fact that everyone on the planet will be at risk of being infected with the virus”.
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of a coronavirus a pandemic.
WHO Director-General stated that WHO was “deeply concerned at both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and at the equally alarming level of inaction in this regard”. WHO was severely criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the late announcement of the public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the current situation, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, Director-General of WHO, was asked to resign, which was signed by 733,000 as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to take life-saving measures against him and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, prisoners, refugees and other indeterminate groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and recommendations.
The Digital Node contains information on policy measures by different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, eliminate quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote coordinated global responses to the fight against coronavirus.
The Government of China was criticized by the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Houwa and Eduardo Bolsonar, the son of President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonara, for taking action to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubay.
A number of leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) at the provincial level were dismissed for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these dismissals showed dissatisfaction with the reaction of the political responsibility to outbreaks in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jingpin, from public anger over the outbreak of the corona virus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lizziang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of coronavirus had begun in Uhan, but had taken sides with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had arisen in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trump's administration called coronavirus “the Chinese virus” or “the U.S. virus”, stating that “the censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement has been criticized by some commentators who argue that such an approach is racist and “retracts from the inability of the U.S. President's administration to control the spread of the disease”.
The Daily Beast has access to the U.S. government telegram, which contains communication strategic cunning, apparently created by the National Security Council, and there are references to the strategy: “It's all about China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television presentations.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus were part of the “advocacy effort” to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through the pier and so-called generosity policies”.
Borrell also stated that “China is moving forward with the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States.”
China also called on the United States to abolish sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information sending assistance to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned from the United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting aid to their own country.
Health masks were also disputed between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has assigned hundreds of IWLs intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus of Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that “only China has responded bilaterally.
This clearly does not show European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, President Vladimir Putin of Russia organized a shipment to Italy of Russian military sanitation, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source” as saying that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “useless or not useful to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Lombardia Attilio Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy Luigi Di Mayo rejected media attacks and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin's Spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that “in offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when the United States producers of medical equipment and materials increase their production rate, they will also be able to respond as necessary”.
NATO military exercises Protector-2020, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest-scale military exercises of NATO after the end of the cold war, will be implemented in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 (Protector-2020) exercise: “In the crisis that has taken place today in the field of public health, the conduct of these exercises endangers not only the lives of the US military and many European participating countries, but also the inhabitants of the countries where such activities are to be carried out.” The Iranian Government has suffered greatly from the virus. About two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as fifteen other current or former politicians.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani made an open letter to the world leaders requesting assistance, stating that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets for sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran.
Politologists expected that this could adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea criticized Japan 's mixed and passive quarantine measures' after Japan had announced that any citizen who had come from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in a special government site.
South Korean society was initially divided because of President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the actions of the President or called on Mr. Moon to impeach the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease to be inadequate, and the pandemic has forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orban an indefinite right to administer decrees, suspend Parliament's work, and hold elections and punish those charged with disseminating feical information on the virus and on government measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of coronavirus has resulted in a number of shortages of supply owing to the global increase in the use of epidemic equipment, the accumulation of goods in panic and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Administration for Food and Drug Quality Control issued warnings on the lack of medicines and medical equipment, resulting from increased consumer demand and disruption of vendors.
There have also been panic buyings in several locations; this has led to the loss of essential goods from the stores, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for individual protection has risen 100 times.
This leap led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It also created a lack of individual protection throughout the world, and WHO warned that health workers would be hit for that reason.
In Australia, as a result of the Daigo pandemic, buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
In spite of the high incidence of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food in both areas, the Government of Australia has since been banned in some supermarkets.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illegal trade in critical products that have been successful have avoided the severe food shortages that were expected in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but the industry believes that agricultural prices can rise.
Food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the town of Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to the supply of pigs to ensure that the population was fully nourished.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to maintain food stocks in emergency situations.
The damage caused by the world economy affected China: according to the media of 16 March, China ' s economy suffered greatly in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the Government to combat the spread of the virus, which resulted in a 20.5 per cent decrease in retail sales.
Maternal China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, a viral outbreak is believed to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agatha Demarai, an economist Intelligence Unit, volatility in markets will continue until there is a better understanding of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic could outweigh the effects of the Atypical Pneumonia 2002-2004 epidemic.
One of the estimates made by an expert at the University of Washington, St. Louis, that the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion and could have a negative impact of up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have taken “temporary action” following a sharp drop in oil prices due to the decline in demand from China.
On 24 February, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronaviruses, various U.S. stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow-Johns for industrial shares, showed the most dramatic decline since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1,191 — the largest one-day decline since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10 per cent drop.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative forecast.
Shares fell again due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus and the biggest decline occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by the central banks and States.
Central banks react more quickly than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with travel bans, closures of public places, including tourist attractions, and no travel by Governments.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines cancelled flights due to the sharp decline in air traffic demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and British Flybe regional airline ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise industry has proved more powerful than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chung-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
A number of events involving a large number of people, including annual New Year's Festivals, have been cancelled by national and regional Governments; private companies have also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many new events were cancelled and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass gatherings of people; for example, the Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs were closed in Beijing.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and areas of China, the authorities extended the new holidays until 10 February, allowing the majority of enterprises not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong authorities raised their response to infectious diseases up to the highest level and declared an emergency by closing schools until March and canceling the New Year ' s celebration. The retail sector was hit globally by reduced hours of shop operations and some shops were temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retail businesses in North America and the Middle East reduced sales sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March the attendance of shopping centres dropped by 33 to 43 per cent as compared to February.
The operators of the trading centres around the world have introduced additional measures such as improving sanitation, installing equipment to check the temperature of visitors and abolish activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million more people behind poverty than would have been in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China in the midst of the Uhan epidemic.
Many of China ' s 300 million migrant rural workers found themselves at home in the provinces of their country or locked up in Hubay Province, and in March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought Government assistance.
According to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis, the outbreak of coronavirus in the United States could deprive 47 million people of their jobs and unemployment rates could reach 32 per cent. Self-inclusion measures introduced in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers paid daily. A study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute revealed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers also lost their jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Nearly half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to a government-subsidized reduced working schedule — part-time.
The German part-time wage scheme was also introduced in France and Britain.
The spheres of art and cultural heritage were also severely affected by the pandemic that affected organizations and individuals, whether officially employed or independent, worldwide.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often financed by the State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, as well as supporting, where possible, the people of the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed for an indefinite period worldwide, or access to them had been limited to a variety of extent, and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In return, active efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms; yet another recent and emerging phenomenon resulting from the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
There have also been setbacks in the film industry, and the Vatican has announced the abolition of the activities of the Remarkable Week in Rome during the last week of the Christian repentant period, the Grand Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches church services began to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while church leaders offer open - air services.
Rome’s Roman Catholic Empire closed its churches, temples, and the square of St. Peter, where Christian pilgrims were no longer present, and later other religious organizations had also abolished their services and restricted their access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourmets.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of coronavirus and the shrines were closed later; Saudi Arabia prohibited the access of foreign pilgrims and its own inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 League of Champions, the 2019-20 Premier League, the Euro-2020 WEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak of coronavirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transmitted beyond 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021”. Casinos and other gambling facilities around the world were closed and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast on live air, were either transferred or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players becoming online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered as various musical groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and exchanging their results on the Internet, organizing direct broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in creative professions to continue to perform, publish or publish their works.
A number of Internet memes have emerged on the subject of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth out the disturbing sentiments of periods of uncertainty.
Since the birth of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as representatives of the people of the hot spots of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
In February (when most cases of contamination were still limited by China), racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received just retribution for anything were reported.
There has also been an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment in some African countries.
Many residents of Ukhany and Hubey reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China ' s citizens, as well as its inhabitants, were supported in both off-line and online networks in the areas affected by the virus.
The epidemic has begun to spread to new countries, particularly Italy, the first country in Europe, facing a serious outbreak of COVID-19; citizens of such regions can also begin to experience the impact of suspicion and xenophobia, and citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed a petition early in their lives, insisting that China ' s citizens should not enter their countries to contain the epidemic.
In Japan hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (ChinasDon'tComeInJapan) held leading positions in Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report a growing level of racist sentiment and even attacks.
President Donald Trump of the United States was criticized for calling the coronavirus “the Chinese virus”; critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protestors attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Uhan.
Students coming from the border with China in north-eastern India and studying in major cities of India reported prosecutions related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and that “God has therefore avenged them”.
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, who called them “misleading”. In China, xenophobia and racism re-emerged against non-Chinese citizens: foreigners became known as “foreign garbage” and objects subject to “utilization”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many researchers have put their scientific articles on the outbreak of coronavirus into open access.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their research on pre-emptive publications, such as bioRxiv.
The spreading infectious disease is an infectious disease from a returning pathogen, a range of which or a method of transmission is often unknown.
Globalization and disease — Overview of globalization and the spread of disease

The trafficking of wild animals and diseases from an animal is a health risk associated with the trade in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes virus detection methods and antibody detection techniques produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by TK-PCR, which recognizes the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and intended only for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population control.
Antibody analyses reveal the number of people who have passed on the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to treat them in the hospital or were absent at all.
The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined on the basis of such a test.
As at March 2020, no reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population had been available in any country owing to limited testing capacity.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests conducted in different countries was very contradictory.
Such differences are likely to have a significant impact on registered mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
A real-time (rRT-PCR) test can be performed on breath samples obtained in different ways, including a nose swab or wet sample.
The results are generally available over a period of several hours to two days.
The TNA-PCR test is valid only for the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, but it still reproduces in the lungs.
For infected patients tested for the second week of the disease, the lower respiratory pathway material may be taken as an alternative, either using a suction catheter or using the products of the meal (wet).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Sharite clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and the foundation of 250,000 sets subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech had developed a clinical level PCR detection kit (PowerChek Coronavius).
It identifies the “E” gene common to all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group has become one of the first companies to have authorized the National Drug Authority of China to use the emergency detection kit SARS-CoV-2 based on CCR. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have distributed their diagnostic panel through the organization of the International Reagent Resource for RT-PC in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to the untreated reagents and the narrow testing area conducted by CDC in Atlanta; the result was an average of less than 100 samples per day processed successfully throughout February 2020.
Two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were public and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Office for Food and Drug Quality Supervision in the framework of an emergency authorization for use, and the US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection on the basis of RT-PCW across the country.
Quest Diagnostics has started testing for COVID-19 throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been stated; sampling and processing of analyses must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology, EECCAr.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Oversight Service and Mayo was reported to have developed a test on 12 March 2020 for the detection of COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA's approval for a test that could be conducted within 3.5 hours for a large sample, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests for 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency permission for the use (EUA) of Abbott laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously FDA issued a similar permission to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also receives EUA from FDA for a test of about 45 minutes.
FDA also approved a test that uses the amplification technology of isothermal nucleic acids instead of PCDs.
Since the test does not require a series of alternating temperatures, the method can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day, and Taiwan is currently developing a test using a monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds to a new coronavirus (N-white) and hopes to be able to obtain results in 15-20 minutes, such as a flu express test.
The March 2020 review of specialized literature concluded that “breast cell X-rays have little diagnostic value at early stages, while the results of the CK [computer tomography] may have such value even before symptoms occur”.
The typical signs identified by the CT include bilateral multi-way sub-platform embossing focussed with peripheral, asymmetric and aposterior distribution.
Sub-platform domination, the symptoms of boulevard bridge and consolidation are evolving as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCD and CT methods used in Uhan at the time of the current pandemics showed that the CTC was much more sensitive than the CCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has published the recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a test method for testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnosis”. As at March 2020, the initial CDC screening recommends using the PCR method.
A partial immune response to infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and for the purpose of popular monitoring, analyses can be performed in central laboratories (CTs) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-production automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each system.
The CLT usually uses one sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples may also be used to monitor the immune response.
At the PoCT, one blood sample is usually produced by a puncture of each cover.
Unlike PCD techniques, the blood collection phase for the sampling is not required. On 26 March 2020, the FDA identified 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As at 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one test for the urgent authorization of use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits for the use of their test kits, which can be detected in samples of IgG and IgA antibodies capable of fighting the virus.
The test performance is several hundred samples for several hours and therefore the method works much faster than the usual viral RNA PC analysis.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection, and in early April, Britain discovered that none of its antibody analysis kits produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspicion of the virus to stay at home: “the emergency department staff are handing over a sample of the patient”, the patient spits back on it, and then receives the test results after a while. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot case testing scheme in the home environment, which eliminates the risk of infection by other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if used to transport the patient. In the course of the COVID-19 stress testing, the medical officer is examining in suspicious cases using all appropriate precautions.
The stress centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than in any other country. On 2 March in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Medical Physicians stated that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests a day in ambulatory conditions and only 10,700 tests a week earlier.
If the survey is commissioned by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Koh Institute, Germany's total testing productivity is 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, it was suggested that a number of major cities should be tested by express testing.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests submitted in Germany was unknown as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of calendar week 12/2020, at SARS-CoV-2, a total of at least 483,295 analyses were taken up to Week 12/2020, including 33,491 copies (6.9%) of the result were positive. The researchers at the Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a simultaneous test method for samples taken by 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further analyses only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Uhan on 5 February 2020, the BGI company opened a temporary laboratory with an area of 2000 square metres to detect incidents of Hoo-Yang (Chinese or Fire Glaze) which could process more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Wang Jiang and completed in only five days; the modelling showed that if the laboratory had not been put into service at such an accelerated rate, the cases in Hubea would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore the cost of quarantine would have been twice as high.
The Huo-Yang labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in total, were immediately opened in 12 cities of China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, with open multiplex schemes of Origami Assays, which can test up to 1,222 patients on COVID19 using only 93 samples, which can operate in small laboratories, excluding the need for robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, the lack of and lack of reagents had led to the problem of mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States.
As a result, some authors applied to test sample processing protocols that provided for warming samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the test volume for coronavirus, currently being conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita, was higher than that of any other country, and soon most of the population would be tested.
This was due to the possibilities of express testing, along with the acquisition by Group 42 and BGI of mass population testing laboratories (created on the basis of their laboratories for the detection of Huo-Yang emergencies in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCD tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside China.
Various testing options for different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the production of test kits that are sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States sanitary and epidemiological centres was not available until 28 January, which resulted in the absence of test kits in the United States. At the very beginning of the outbreak in China and the United States, there were problems with test kit reliability, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient numbers of kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts say, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has worked to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as a better way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing resulting from the rapid spread of the virus, many U.S. private laboratories, which had received hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis, were overloaded and supplies for the collection of oil and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by CDC had “defects” and for that reason the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered the private development of the tests. Spain obtained test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of the use of these kits were inaccurate.
The company explained that poor sampling or poor use of kits could be the cause of inaccuracy.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would cancel the wrong sets and replace them with other sets of Shenzhen Bioeasy kits. 80 per cent of the test kits that the Czech Republic had obtained in China had failed. 1.2 million test kits acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović proposed to drop them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, a member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits acquired in China had “a high level of error” and the Ministry “did not use them”. The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced that these were not suitable for use in early April 2020.
Quarantine measures for those whose analysis had positive results on the SARS-CoV-2, as well as the monitoring of people who had been contacted by such patients, had positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of Vo, where the first person died from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing for the whole population of about 3,400 at a interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of disease were quarantined.
The entry into the settlement was closed and the spread of the infection has been fully halted.
With the intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures of the 2020 Corona virus pandemic in Singapore, there was much less tension than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose such extreme restrictions as forced closing of restaurants and shops.
Many events were cancelled there, and on 28 March, Singapore began to urge residents to stay home, but schools where the holidays ended on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through the intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, but their restrictions were less aggressive.
A statistical study found that in countries where more tests were conducted than deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because more patients with mild symptoms or lack of symptoms were identified.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, submit their first five positive and first ten negative analyses to COVID-19 in one of the WHO 16 control laboratories for supporting testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
On the next graph, the indicator of the "positive results" column depends on the country-specific testing policy.
The country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result than the country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of cleaning hands to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap in certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted in a fecal-oral way.
Humans may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or ordinary cold, such as by touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. mucus) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, followed by washing hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the berries of the child or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before meals, and before and after cooking or preparing raw meat, fish and domestic birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with gold. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the procedure for the care of the sick person.
After changing diapers or washing the baby, going to the bathroom.
After you're wet, cough or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Medical hygienic hands refer to hygienic activities related to medical procedures.
Wash hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases) and of chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Handwashing is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the rate of infant mortality in households.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by learning simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular handwashing reminders may reduce the number of diarrhoea by about a third, comparable to that of low-income regions.
Reducing diarrhoea by 48 per cent can be associated with washing hands with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory disease (ORS) with appropriate habits in every home, in schools and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of the ORI, is the main cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which accounts for about 1.8 million children a year.
Almost 3.5 million children die of diarrhoea and pneumonia each year.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after the toilet, which has become a solid habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhoea deaths almost twice as much and mortality from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The washing of hands also prevents the onset of an impetuous disease, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A slight negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it may cause drying of the skin and, as a result, damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to a disease known as eczema or hand-drive, especially among health workers.
Too often hand washing can also be considered a symptom of obsessive and compulsive disorder (CD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important for reducing the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (moisturizing, defecation), after washing the berries of the child (drug change), before feeding the child, before taking food and before/after cooking or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of the cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or snorting, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching the garbage.
In many countries, washing hands with soap is quite limited.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 showed that on average 38.7 per cent of soap washing families were generally accepted. The 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97 per cent, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States was closer to the middle, 77 per cent; the lowest was recorded in China, 23 per cent; there are several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group hand washing with school children is one of the same methodologies that helps to teach children to do so.
The Emergency Health Programme, carried out by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale activities to promote child health and education for children.
This national programme is based on degelmintization, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorine.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective when soap or detergents are added to the washing process.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove the barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means of cleansing the skin, since fats and proteins that are part of organic contamination are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the purification process.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may reach it during previous use.
A small number of studies on the incidence of contaminated solid soap bacteria on each cover show that the bacteria are less likely to fall because they are washed with foam.
The CDC still claims that “Jewish soap with a manual meter is the preferred option for washing hands”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health - care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has selective effects on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosane, which are resistant to many resistant organisms.
Thus, even if the strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with the advertised.
In addition to the surface-active substance and skin protection agents, complex compounds may contain acids (suspical, ascorbic, milky) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other ventricles (saltin, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). The integrated analysis of the Oregon Public Health School showed that in terms of prevention and removal of bacteria from the skin, simple soap varieties are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosane.
Hot water that is comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37 °C.
However, in order to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to popular belief, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial stress on the hands.
Hand disinfectant (sanitizer) or hand septic is a means of hygienic water-free hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the use of alcohol-free hand hygiene tools (also known as alcohol disinfectants, antiseptic hand disinfectants or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these products are made on the basis of an isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as acrylic acid carbomer (polymer) in gel form, or moisturizers such as glycerin in liquid or foam, which make it easier to use these products and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases the antimicrobial activity and disinfectants containing a minimum of 60 to 95 per cent of alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Spirit-disinfecting agents kill bacteria, including bacteria with multiple drug resistance (MSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
The disinfectants containing 70 per cent alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 3.5, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) in arms 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent of bacteria (logarith of reduction 4-5) in arms 1 minute after use. Hand disinfectants are the most effective against bacteria and are less effective against some viruses.
Spirit disinfectants are virtually ineffective against non-viral (or Norwalk) viruses of the type, the most common cause of the infectious gastroenterite, and sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-containing means are needed to carefully process and test the skin of the hands on both sides.
The individual and rear surface of both ladons, as well as the space between the fingers and the whole length, shall be dissolved for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully nourished.
The fingertips on both hands should also be washed carefully. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the hands be washed rather than disinfectant, especially if the hands are severely contaminated.
The increasing popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of hand disinfectants on a alcohol-based basis may cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softening agents and/or moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softening substances to the substance.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing softening components caused much less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobial cleaning agents.
Allergenic contact dermatitis, contact fibrosis syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.
The lower probability of irritant contact dermatitis has become a factor in the selection of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-free products do not cleanse hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms, such as regular soap and water, since pathogens are still in the hands of such tools.
The effectiveness of a non-spite disinfectant depends to a large extent on components and composition and has historically been much lower than that of alcohol or alcohol.
It has recently been demonstrated that the drugs that use benzolium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to lose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive side effects of each reaction.
Many people in low - income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with gold or clay.
Gold or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or gold is contaminated by microorganisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, gold is a disinfectant because it produces a water-based solution.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of oil or sand as an alternative.
In order to prevent contamination, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommend the use of hand washing techniques, which include the following stages:
Swim your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that the water is leaking because the water can be contaminated and the water temperature does not matter at all.
Wash your hands by wiping them with a lot of soap, including the back of the ladonium, as well as areas between fingers and under the fingernails.
The soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap (and not just one water).
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
It helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you three hands, the more germs are removed.
Swim your hands thoroughly under running water.
Embarking hands in standing water can cause re-contamination.
Wipe your hands with a clean cloth, or let them dry themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more easily polluted, and most often people leave areas such as a big finger, a wrist, areas between their fingers and under their fingernails.
Artificial nail polishes and broken nail polish may contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wetting lotion be used to prevent skin drying, which may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If leaky water and soap are not available, there are many different ways to wash hands: pouring water out of the hanging canister or bottled canister with the opened openings and (or) using oil, if necessary, as in developing countries. In places with limited water (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water saving solutions such as taps with legs and other inexpensive options.
A tap with a knife pedal is a simple construction consisting of a vessel hung on a rope and a knife lever that should be pressed to put water on its hands and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand - hygienic processes, but there are some disputes about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Growing research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than hand dryers installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, was sponsored by the European Symposium on paper napkins and towels; this study was based on a comparison of hygienicity of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern air-to-hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying the hands of the dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the finger cushions increased by an average of 194 per cent and 254 per cent in the trays.
It was also found that after washing and drying the hands of the dryer with airflow, the total number of bacteria on the finger cushions increased by 42 per cent and 15 per cent in the trays.
After washing and drying the hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the finger pillows is on average reduced to 76 per cent and on the flax to 77 per cent, and scientists have also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to toilet rooms and toilet environments with each type of drying.
An air dryer that emits air at the declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 m/h), can blow microorganisms out of hand and out of its own compartment and can potentially infect other users of the toilet room and sanuses within a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
There was no significant proliferation of micro-organisms in paper towels. In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt conducted a study on the assessment of various hand-drying methods.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
Cleaning hands with disinfectants may be an alternative during travel in the absence of soap and water.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant shall contain at least 60 per cent of alcohol.
The medical method of handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignac Zemmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases under stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the level of contamination.
Medical washing of hands lasts for at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel for washing and washing each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other by clapping their fingers.
If there is dirt under the fingernails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water in hand, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean cloth.
After drying the hands, closing the tap and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, a paper towel should be used.
This avoids repeated contamination of hands from these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in medical facilities is to remove and prevent pathogenic microorganisms (microbes) and to prevent their proliferation.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, correct hand washing and other basic procedures may reduce the level of catetera-related bleeding infection by 66 per cent; the World Health Organization has published a leaflet showing the standard hand washing and handling procedure to be applied in the health sector.
WHO ' s hand-hygiene draft is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
The review was co-sponsored by Whitby.
Commercial devices may be used to measure the indicators and check the health of the hands when required to confirm compliance with the regulatory requirements.
The World Health Organization denotes “five moments” when the hands are to be washed:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before the use of antiseptic, as well as
After patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap at hand (medicine or antimicrobial soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary prior to surgery or in the environment with high levels of antibiotics resistant organisms. For the “cleaning” of hands before surgery, a tap can be included and turned off without regard to its hands; also a little chlorhexidine or iodine water should be used to wash hands, sterile hand wipers for washing hands, sterile brushes for exercise and another sterile nail cleaning tool.
All ornaments must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of hands and forearms before elbows usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to wipe your hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During swallowing, water with a forearm should not fall back on the bones.
After washing, the hands dry with sterile cloth and wear a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic to your hands before and after the care of a sick person.
In order to combat stophylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent washing of hands was the most beneficial and that very few additional benefits were received when hand washing was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared with the washing of antibacterial soap, the washing of hands with soap results in more than three times the frequency of bacterial communicable diseases passed through food. The comparison of the control of the hands with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the treatment of the hands of the alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol solutions for the hands to reduce the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus and the Clostridium diflule dispute. The development of hand hygienic activities in medical institutions may include the training of hand washing staff, the increased availability of alcohol-containing solutions for the hands, and written and oral reminders of the staff on the need to wash hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective measures in various health facilities.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even food.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or washing of hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to practice regular washing of hands.
For example, most rural areas in Africa do not have enough private or public toilets to wash their hands, although there are cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, inadequate hand hygiene may also be due to entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Propagandizing and stimulating hand-washing with soap could affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results are required.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-based health care and epidemiological surveillance was less effective, while public marketing campaigns were less effective; one example of school hand washing advocacy was the approach of the Three Star Approach United Nations Children ' s Fund: it promoted simple cost-effective measures in schools that encouraged washing by students using soap and other hygienic requirements.
By meeting minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of handicrafts is one of the possible measures implemented in the framework of the hand hygienic information campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
The Global Hand Wash Day, another example of a change of behaviour information campaign, as a result of the 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of hand-washing emodes.
Some studies looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in comparison with DALYs (maintenance years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, English nurse and “founder of modern care for the sick”.
At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by rotting odours called myasms.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-related infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States became more active in promoting hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect their body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “right hand washing machines” were used in public toilets as well as in office and airport toilets.
The phrase “hand-holding” means the expression of its unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to be a party to something.
It is from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands ” in deciding the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; later this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In the play Macbeth Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands impermissibly in an attempt to rid herself of the imaginary stain symbolizing the impure conscience of the crimes she committed herself and to induce her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or have observed an unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than others, and for them, handmaiden are more important.
It is also less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
The washing of hands in religions is both a hygienic and symbolic. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual of many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tivilah and netilat ondayim in Judaism, Lavbo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe compulsory washing of hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, washing hands before and after each meal is considered necessary.
Control of production factors in relation to COVID 19
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 implies the use of occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and control coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk management depends on the place and the job, based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic in the community and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office for Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that lower-risk posts had minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures were needed to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home with signs of illness, observing respiratory ethics, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Middle-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 but who are likely to be infected by the current spread of disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include public relations workers, such as in schools, a high population density working environment and in some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures for the prevention of infection, include air ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA is of the opinion that medical and morbid personnel who have contacted a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of infection of COVID-19 are considered to be at high risk, while the risk is increased to a very high level in the conduct of procedures associated with the formation of aerosols or the collection/processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk management measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the purpose.
The COVID-19 flash may have different effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of possible contamination.
Commercial templates may vary with respect to both the types of goods that are subject to demand and the ways in which such goods are purchased (e.g. purchases in non- peak periods of delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19 could be broken. The Plan for Epidemic Preparedness and Response could be used in the organization of protection.
The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors, emerging homes and communities, as well as the risk factors of individual workers, such as old age or chronic illness.
Plans also indicate the means of monitoring needed to address such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the targets for response to the epidemic: reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
Response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure that is widely used to ensure safety and health at work for grouping such funds according to efficiency.
When the risk of COVID 19 cannot be addressed, the most effective safety engineering equipment, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protective equipment are most effective.
Safety engineering means that staff are isolated from workplace risks and that they do not rely on employee behaviour, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures include changes in working policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or staff member.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help address some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment shall be selected depending on the threat to the worker, be sized (e.g. respirators), used continuously and duly, regularly checked, maintained in good condition and replaced as necessary, as well as properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Office for Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that posts at least risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
The basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all jobs include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay home, compliance with the respiratory label, including the closure of the mouth by coughing and sneezing, the provision of napkins and garbage containers, preparedness for remote or replacement work, as appropriate, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons potentially infected is a critical step for the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff with symptoms of acute respiratory disease remain at home until the end of the heat, lack of fever and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of gironizing agents or other symptoms medications, as well as that staff members be allowed to remain at home to care for sick family members and to be informed of such policies.
According to OSHA, mid-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not confirmed or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but are likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of disease in society in the territory where the business is located or the recent travel of such a person to the places of distribution of COVID-19.
These categories include public workers, e.g. in schools, a working environment with high population density and some large retail stores: engineering and safety equipment for such groups and higher-risk groups include the establishment of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of consumer services without driving. Administrative measures for such a group and higher-risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to remain at home, to replace personal meetings for communication through virtual means, to establish replacement timetables, to stop non-critical travel in the areas of COVID-19 distribution, to develop communication plans in emergency situations, including a forum for responding to the concerns of workers, to provide timely training for workers at the risk factors COVID-19 and to protect workers who need to be used in the protection areas of COVID-19, to develop emergency communication plans for emergency situations, including a forum for responding to the concerns of workers, to provide adequate training to COVID19 and to protect workers in the working environment, to ensure the regular and management of the working environment, to ensure the need of the working environment, to manage and management of the working persons, to manage them, to manage them, to work, and to manage them, and to manage them, to manage them, to manage them.
In rare cases, workers from such a risk group may need to carry respiratory agents.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate safety of workers and other passengers requires measures such as isolation of a sick person from other persons at 6 feet, appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, giving a sick person mask or seeking such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin in a cough or sneezing.
Secondary crew members shall wear disposable medical gloves when approaching the sick traveller or in contact with physiological liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and the contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures include delaying a medical trip in the event of illness, isolation and immediate notification of a medical centre on board if there is a heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in a school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average rate of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, such as the cancellation of visits to personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as physical exercise or singing, food intake in cafes, increased distance between parties, time of arrival and care, limited non-essential visits, the use of separate health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of distribution in the local community, in addition to social dislocation strategies, measures may be considered for long-term non- attendance at school, and for law enforcement officials performing daily duties, the immediate risk to health is considered to be low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are encouraged to follow the same instructions as those prescribed by ambulance vendors, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
When close contact occurs during detention, workers shall clean and disinfect their formal belts and equipment prior to re-use by household cleaning aerosols or by washing, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and to dispose of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and spraying of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical care, support, laboratory and medical personnel who contact patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of contamination in their processes accompanied by aerosol education or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures associated with aerosol education include sensing, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling by invasive methods.
Seafarers at high risk include personnel involved in the treatment of persons with confirmed illness or suspicion of contagion of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such staff members are exposed, they are placed in a very high-risk category. Additional security equipment for such risk groups includes the use of isolated premises for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including in the conduct of procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In some health facilities and morgues, special ventilation with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
Tests should be conducted in accordance with the precautionary measures provided for at the level of biosecurity 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be placed in separate waiting zones, depending on suspicions of contamination of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protection facilities, OSHA recommends that respiratory arresters be used by workers who interact up to 6 feet away with patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of contamination of SARS-CoV-2, as well as those who conduct procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In the U.S., approved NIOC respirators for the N95 filter or higher class should be used as part of an integrated written programme on respiratory protection, which identifies requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory agents can provide more effective protection and comfort for a staff member. WHO does not recommend the use of specialty, since COVID-19 is a disease transmitted as respiratoryly and not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for screening staff at the patient reception point.
WHO recommends that patients who collect samples from the respiratory tract of patients with COVID-19 or vectors without procedures accompanied by aerosol education should wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective screen for the face, robe and gloves.
The N95 or FFP2 respirator should be used instead of surgical mask.
Given the lack of individual protection facilities around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protections through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparent glasses, ensuring access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, using only the personal protective equipment required for a particular task, using the same respirator for long periods without removing, working with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and recommending not using masks for people without symptoms.

COVER: [Covid-19] Facilitating workload and preparation for the future
DATE/TIME OF REFERENCE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DETERMINATION: CC0: No rights protected
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interrelationship of people around the world and our responsibilities to each other.
We did not have precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the capacity to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is the foundation of such an organization.
We have observed friendly and caring relationships among all of our colleagues, as reflected in our electronic correspondence, phone calls, and chat rooms — a remarkable reminder of the fact that we are fortunately being dealt with by amazing people.
I speak with great gratitude and pride of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was briefed on the appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of the importance of the opportunity for peace to address Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it's to make sites operational, to pay our colleagues or to protect the security of communities.
The world needs the information provided in Wikipedia, and today is even more important than ever.
At a time when it is important to achieve meaningful results for peace, not only what we are doing but also how we are doing it.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order in which we work together, starting with the coming week.
Adjustment of our work and timetables
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In the course of our communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and on the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during such a period.
The vast majority of us want to lift the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, let it be.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff personnel:
At our expectations, it will be necessary to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before subsequent orders are received.
We do not declare weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purpose of our mission.
However, the world does not now predict; whatever your needs, whether you care about your family, buy food or go to a doctor, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't follow your time of work.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's understandable and unquestionable, but we mention it.
It is not necessary to form a sick leave or leave: just inform your boss and help the team review the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, please inform Briana of the T&C Ops unit so that T&C can provide support and due attention from the management to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to honour our obligations to our contractors and staff members at an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will be paid according to normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This includes, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use their jobs as a way to direct their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can bring surprising results, especially in such times.
And again, it's self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your leader so that we know what to expect and that we can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered substantial.
Such activities must always be sustained.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (other than others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and to shift the emphasis on providing support, which is essential for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we're just focusing on the most important projects.
Deceleration today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “double more to make up for missing” after the pandemic is over.
You will not be required to work overtime to meet the unreal deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and deadlines, as far as possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the time frame for the implementation of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of time for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for loved ones, while ensuring a reduced schedule for the next few weeks for all who need or want to work.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning and tension burden throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, to the representatives and to the teams with relevant information on the following steps immediately after receipt of the relevant confirmation.
Thank the APP team for the leadership role in this work.
Status of office, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
In addition to the many precautionary measures, however, we hired a counter-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used antiviral solutions in the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building is subject to its own rules requiring caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the time when we decide to come back.
Our office in the district of Colombia (DC) is on the WeWork network, which shared with us and all the staff in DC its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the district of Colombia had completely moved to remote work in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed renting a facility in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work away for the first time.
Our old colleagues working away know of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
For longer sessions, consider the possibility of splitting them into a course of several days.
Clearly identify the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and advance the material for consultation.
By default, use the video link, to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
To facilitate the appointment of a coordinator, a person who will follow up on the issues in the chat room and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for keeping the notes (or joint observation).
If necessary, please contact the Technical Support Service by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement programme for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about the assigned work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics manuals available in web pages to facilitate the effectiveness of shared work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel the mass events financed by Wikimedia, such as ‘editathons’, until WHO announced the completion of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may lead to the inability to carry out concerted activities on grants, and no one will be fined for having to delay or change such objectives.
In the coming week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The general sentiments in the global community are not only disheartening over the interruption, but also some feeling of mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
In terms of prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor exposure and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We will extend to your calendar an invitation to a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions, and spend time with each other.
We are together in this situation and ready to help everyone we can.
At the same time, you can still obtain information from such electronic correspondence, and other important information from COVID-19 from the Wiki Office.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about travel, activities, key workflows, problems with information coverage, or if necessary contact CRT for other assistance.
We are ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If there are confidentiality problems, contact Brian Judean, director of HR International Global Operations by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as abandoning our work and our obligations.
On the contrary: this recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the whole world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate times.
Today is the time to support each other and to create a space for important work to be done in the coming weeks and possibly months.
In order for this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families and to work at the maximum cost once such a need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the other participants of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human enzyme version is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal ferment located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 contains the N-end peptidide domain of M2 and the S-end transport domain of the real amino acids.
ACE2 is a single-passer type I membrane, and its enzymely active domain is placed on the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 is removed from the transmembraned domain by another enzyme known as Sheddasze and the reconstituted protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar types II cells, thin intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 and RNA are also found in the cortex of the brain, the striathum, the hypothalamus and the trunk of the brain.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterweight.
ACE dissolves angiotensin I hormone into a co-constituting angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, removes the carbonic end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysates it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also split a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apricotin, neurotensin, dinophine A and greline.
ACE2 also regulates the transport of the transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present with Hartnoup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main point of entry for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-Virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, the binding of S1-SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endosome and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme in endosomes inside cells.
This entry process also requires that the S-serial proteasis of the TMPRSS2 carrier is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent, which has led some to believe that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can help combat infection.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulators recommend that standard therapy be continued by APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors who have been at higher risk with pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors has also been associated with lower pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less reliable than patients at general pneumonia risk.”
It is expected that recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novelty in therapy for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in adults with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The rhACE2 half-life in humans is approximately 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the 24 hour duration of exposure.
Some data suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising tool for people with an intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors ( RAS inhibitors) or in patients with an elevated angiotensin II circulatory disease. rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones to assist in epidemiological investigations in the context of the 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic, i.e. in the identification of persons who could contact the infected person.
Many applications formally supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed in some regions.
Several options have been developed to track contacts.
This led to a discussion on confidentiality issues, especially with regard to systems based on tracking the geographical location of application users.
Softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join their efforts to integrate the Bluetooth support function directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, has launched an annex that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities, and an annex called TraceTogether is used in Singapore.
The annex has been developed by local IT companies, has an open source and will be controlled by the Government. Northern Macedonia has launched the StopKorona app, which is working on Bluetooth to help track contacts with potentially infected people and ensure operational contact with health authorities.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the annex was expected to be registered at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking annex was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within several weeks, and similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use the application with a geozoning function to ensure that patients with COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, University of Cambridge security professor, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with applications-based systems, including false response and potential inefficiencies if only a small part of the population are applied.
Given the concern about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “coronavir” annexes, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their annexes to the App Store by including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Participants in the privacy campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through coronavirus applications; in particular, the question was whether the monitoring infrastructure established to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such oversight.
The organizations announced eight conditions for public projects:
monitoring shall be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by time-limiting reservations;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the proliferation of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and proof of such security provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties must be determined at the level of legislation;
the right of citizens to respond to abuse should be protected from abuse and the right to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the issue of permanent observation, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as the need is gone.
In some countries, net tracking of location is used instead of applications, which excludes loading of the application and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, net tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to baseline location data also have major potential problems with confidentiality.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed with confidentiality, which use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special annex, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data on tracking mobile devices and map transactions, and then merged them to create text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
Not only has the Government used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected persons, but it has also made information available on the location of the public, which has been made possible due to significant changes in the legislation on protection of information that has been made following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information can be accessed through a number of annexes and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both central systems and confidentiality systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details have not yet been made public.
The monitoring of contacts with confidentiality is a well-established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013; as at 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups have been working on decisions that ensure confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol; decentralized protocols include decentralized tracing with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols for confidentiality, mechanisms for tracking mobile contacts (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identified personal data never leave the device and all the comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that preserves confidentiality when collecting and using location data or crossing paths to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on studies published in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemitic”, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company developing technologies for confidentiality, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies to allow users to share confidential location and health data with other users and officials without putting those data at risk of confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were founded by a global TCN coalition aimed at reducing the fragmentation and global compatibility of applications for monitoring and alerting, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace reference code used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the major technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Establishment of tools to enable Governments to establish official annexes to monitor the movement of citizens infected with coronavirus but with data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with continuous surveillance, first by implementing the system through the upgrade of the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
The repositioning of the drug (also known as reprofiling, redistribution, modification of tasks or therapeutic redistribution of drugs) is the reprofiling of the approved medicinal product for the treatment of a disease or a medical condition other than the disease originally prescribed for development.
This is one of the areas of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusing of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins that are susceptible to drugs, each with several ligand-binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides an appropriate basis for the development of an effective antiviral anti-convulsant agent against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target target for SARS-CoV-2 is Papain-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicasis, S- protein and ADF-ribofosphatease.
Hussain AA and the co-sponsors studied several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analysed their similarity to the most similar approved preparations in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical studies.
Chlorochine is an anti-malarial medicine that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be included in the four drugs investigated in the “Solidarity” clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chlorophate phosphate in accordance with an emergency use permit (EUA).
The treatment regimen has not been approved during the FDA clinical trial and is authorised under EUA only as a pilot treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive clinical treatment.
CDC stated that “the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established”.
Doctors say they're using the drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of hydroxychloroquine.
China's clinical trials in Uhan and Shenzhen have shown that the fan is “singlely effective”.
The 35 patients in Shenzhen who received the medicine received an average of 4 days later, while 45 patients who did not receive the medicine had 11 days of disease.
A study was conducted in Ukhano, which monitored 240 pneumonia patients, one half of whom received a pavivir, and the other half a umifenevir.
The Italian pharmaceutical department reminded the public that the results of the drug's effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered definitive.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase supplies to Japan and that military resources would be used to deliver them to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed the Trump administration of the possibility of purchasing the drug, and the drug may be less effective in the cases of the disease.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to become pregnant.
One study on the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir/ritonavir/Caletra antiviral drugs concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of the preparations has not been identified”.
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by linking to proteasis.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify medications to find a compound that will be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 proteasis. In the scientific community, reprofiling drugs specifically designed for HIV and AIDS therapy is criticized.
WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesvir was established and developed to treat Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences found that remdesivire had antiviral activity in vitro with respect to multiple philo, pneumo, paramixo and coronaviruses.
One problem related to antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdesyvir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance; several clinical tests are currently under way, including two being conducted by Cleveland University Clinics; one being carried out in patients with moderate disease; and the other in patients with a more severe condition.
Three clinical trials are currently under way for the induction of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, tests on antibiotic azithromycin began in New York State.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclosonide) Teijin, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with new coronavirus.
The phase II test, the form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is conducted with the participation of 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of disease in order to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 had been invited with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and not using effective contraception, women cannot participate in this study.
There are several coagulants on the test in Italy.
Low-calorie heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Authority to publish recommendations for the use of the medicine.
On 14 April, a multicentre study involving 300 patients on the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 was a virus, considerable scientific attention was focused on reprofiling approved antivirals that had been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and Western Nile.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in line with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations.
Umifenevir: Umifenevir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been considered potentially suitable for treatment with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would be available earlier than 18 months later.
Five vaccine candidates were conducting Phase I security studies in April.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread throughout the world, leading to significant investments in the development of a vaccine and its research activities.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, large deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI reported that 10 different technological platforms were under way in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in Phase I security research:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine preparation: Moderna, IRNC-1273)
Virus vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines were in the early stages of development, 78 of which were used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute); another 37 candidate vaccines were also reported, but there was little public information (presumably planning or development).
Prior safety and immunogenicity testing is generally performed in phases I-II, randomized, placebo-controlled and several locations with a simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the test usually covers more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested per person (still under preclinical studies).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with molecular fasteners that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine to start testing on people in 2021.

On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that a particle similar to a coronavirus had been created with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
A potential vaccine is being studied in laboratory and human testing is planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that President Donald Trump of the United States offered CureVac “big sums” for exclusive access to Covid-19, against which the Government of Germany protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an IRNA vaccine.

On 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that in April 2020 it would receive the results of the preclinical tests, and their final vaccine candidate preparation could start testing in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Innovation (CEPI), France, announced investing $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine consortium with the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburg University.
Other investment partners in COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different animal vaccines.
Researchers of Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing self-ampliant RNA-vaccin from COVID-19.
The vaccine preparation was developed within 14 days of a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine formulations in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian Government has announced the allocation of $192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for the establishment of a national vaccine bank, which will include several new vaccines that could be used in the case of a new outbreak of coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical School reported that PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stated that “MNA introduced separate SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] that appeared 2 weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA vaccine, which may be produced in the form of a nasal spray.
DNA bacteria will reproduce within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities merged the resources of IBM supercomputers, combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have other benefits than their disease-prevention properties.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines that have been developed may not be safe or effective.
Early studies on the assessment of the effectiveness of animal-based vaccines, characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to contain biosafety 3 infection in the processing of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As at 2020, there are no medicines or protective vaccines for the treatment of SARS that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world. There is also no verified vaccine against MERS.
When the MERS began to be distributed, it was considered that the study of SARS at that time could be a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against the infection of MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was one vaccine (based on DNA) from MERS, which had undergone Phase I of the human clinical trials, and three other vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and were under development, two were adenovirus (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one were MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The social networks had the theory of conspiracy, claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all, and that the vaccine already existed.
The social media quoted the words of some patients who claimed the existence of patents on the genetic sequences of other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhoea, pain in the throat, loss of arms and abdominal pain.
The time from the first occurrence of symptoms to peaks is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases result in mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and polyurethane deficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection in 210 countries and regions had been reported, and more than 153,000 people had died of the disease.
More than 568,000 people recovered, and the virus was mainly distributed in close contact with each other, often through microscopic droplets released in the air by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these droplets are formed during rest, they usually pose a threat, either on the ground or on the surface, but are not passed through the air at long distances.
People are also infected by contaminated surfaces and then by their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most infected within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although it can be spread both before symptoms occur and at later stages. The standard method of diagnosis is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on the model taken as a noseglot oil.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspicion of disease, as well as for those taking care of them.
The recommendations for the use of medical masks differ from that of the population: some agencies recommend that they be not used at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local prevalence has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or symptoms of influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue and swelling.
Extreme symptoms include difficulty in breathing, constant pain or feeling depressed in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulty waking up, sleepiness of the face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, sneezing, or pain in the throat, may rarely be observed.
Also, there are various percentage ratios of stomach and intestine symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some cases of diseases reported in China were initially seen only with shortness of breath and frequent heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease may develop into pneumonia, polyorgan inadequacies, and death may eventually occur.
It's called an incubation period.
The COVID-19 injection period is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5 per cent of people, symptoms begin to occur within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of such non-symptom carriers in the transfer of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary data show that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The proportion of people infected with unsymptomatic disease is currently unknown and is only being studied; the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations of the virus were non-symptomatic.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include unsymptoms in its daily report on 1 April; of the 166 cases of contamination recorded on that day, 130 (78 per cent) refused to be spotless at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
With loud speech, more drops are released into the air than when speaking normal loudness.
A study conducted in Singapore revealed that droplets may extend to a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is generally not air-borne, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of particulates of the virus by bioaerosol is still possible and that air tests processed by air collectors in corridors outside the rooms have shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary resuscitation (CVS), may lead to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through the faeces, but this risk is considered low. The virus is most common when people have symptoms; the virus may spread before symptoms occur, but this risk is small.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not yet quite clear how easily the virus is spread, but it is known that one patient is normally infected by 2 to 3 other people; the virus is able to survive on the surface from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could live on the cardboard surface for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on the stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99 per cent of the copper surfaces for up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
When properly used, soap and detergents have a very useful effect in combating contamination: soap destroys the fat layer of the virus, thereby deactivation it, and can remove it from the skin surface and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonychloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus; during the study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest blood levels of the virus, and the sixth patient had the highest blood levels on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome, first discovered by three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in coronavirus species.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic soap that opens up its protective shell. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
Light is the most susceptible organ to COVID-19 because the virus penetrates the host cell through an angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that is most prevalent in alveolar types II cells.
The virus connects with ACE2 and enters the host cell using the characteristic surface glycoprotein “chip” (peplomer).
12 per cent of those infected who went to the hospital in Uhan had a severe myocardial disorder, which was more likely to occur in severe forms of disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial infarction may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities because they are involved in the work of this body.
The high incidence of thromboembolism (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients in the OIT with COVID-19 and may indicate adverse prognosis.
Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has a tropy to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory pathways, patients with severe COVID-19 experience symptoms of systemic hyperplasia.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-ISF T-cells correlated with the recruitment of IL-6 inflammatory monocytes and the heavy lung pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyteic infiltration has also been detected.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
Real-time (RT-PCI) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained with a nose swab, but can also be used as a sample of nose or wet.
The results are usually completed over a period of several hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at a interval of two weeks, and their results are of no direct relevance.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify the strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop tests themselves using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could detect infection at the present time, as well as possible contamination in the past, were under development but have not yet been widely disseminated.
Chinese experience studying the results of the tests showed that their accuracy was only 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first on-the-spot diagnostic test, allowing it to be used at the end of this month.
The two-way, multi-way, sub-platform seals of the type of matte glass with peripheral, asymmetric and aposterior distribution are common symptoms identified at the early stage of the disease.
Sub-platform domination, the symptoms of a boulevard bridge (the length of thickening of the partition with a variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic damage and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Main results of the autopsy pathological study:
Macroscopy: plurith, pericarditis, sealing and swelling of the lungs
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumonia hyperplasia, large atypical pneumonia, interstitial lymphocytic inflammation and multinuclear giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxaemia.
Exudats in alveolar fields and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular clearance (DVC syndrome); leukoeroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of contamination include home use, avoiding human places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, complying with respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a napkin for coughing or sneezing or, in the absence of a napkin, cover the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a good hand hygienic procedure be conducted.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use in public places of tissue masks, inter alia, to reduce the transmission of disease-free infections; social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and businesses have been closed down, the movement of citizens is limited and major public events have been abolished.
Remoteization recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet away (1.8 m) from each other.
There is no proven efficacy drug against COVID-19, and since the completion of the vaccine is not expected before 2021, most of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 reduce the peak of the epidemic known as the “outlet”.
CDC also recommends that more hands be washed with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or with severe contamination of the hands, as well as before and after the meal, cough or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of disinfectant alcohol (a alcohol content of not less than 60%) for hand-processing, but only when soap and water are not available. In regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two prescriptions for local production.
These compositions use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as moisturizer.
Patients are shown with supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those suspected of being infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory insufficiency, but its benefits are still being explored.
It is recommended that personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diets be respected in order to strengthen immunity.
Supportive treatments can be shown to patients with mild symptoms at early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China published recommendations on care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, IBCC and Intensive Therapy and Pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource — IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
In order to treat the symptoms as first line drugs, some health professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) as compared to ibuprofen.
Care should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health facilities, in the course of procedures in which air-capeal emissions such as intubation or drying of hands may occur.
The CDC recommends that health care workers taking care of persons with COVID-19 should be placed in an air-bath (AIIR), an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. CDC has issued recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (SIZ) during the pandemic.
Personal protective equipment recommended: protective robes, respiratory arresters or medical masks, eye protections and medical gloves. Of the above, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for use under industrial conditions, but FDA has permitted the use of these respiratory agents in accordance with the emergency use permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect particles in the air, such as dust, but there is no guarantee of effective protection from a specific biological agent when not instructed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective front-screens or, in extreme cases, to make masks on their own in the home environment.
In most cases, the forms of COVID-19 flow are not difficult enough to require artificial ventilation of light or its alternative, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory insufficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently being studied and there are some evidence that intubation can be avoided by means of an intense air flow or two-level positive pressure in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods are as effective for patients in critical condition as IWL.
Some doctors choose invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if available, as this method significantly limits the circulation of particles in the air compared to the nasal canal with intense airflow, the risk of severe illness for the elderly (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 infection in severe forms requiring hospitalization.
One study in China revealed that 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation, and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually resuscitated.
The task of providing artificial ventilation for lungs is complicated because acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing in COVID-19 and oxygenation causes more and more problems.
IWL with inhaled pressure and PDCM are necessary to deliver maximum amount of oxygen into the lungs and to ensure minimal damage by ventilation, which may result in pneumonia.
High PDACs may not be available on earlier models of fans.
Potential treatment studies began in January 2020, and a number of antivirals are currently under clinical trial.
Remdesyvir appears to be the most promising.
The development of new medicines may take up to 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are at the latest stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in patients with severe forms of disease.
Volunteers recommended by WHO have been involved in the testing of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments, and FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of reconvalescent plasma as a pilot treatment in cases where human life is at serious or immediate risk.
Its use was not subject to clinical studies that should be conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat outbreaks.
Users must enter their name and identification number for entry.
The Annex may detect “close contact” through observation data and therefore identify the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the annex not only recommends self-inclusion, but also sends notification to local health authorities. Analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile telephone tracking and artificial intelligence is used to track infected persons and persons they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to track the data of mobile phones of people suspected to be infected with coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, with a view to researching and preventing the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided aggregated data on the whereabouts of cellular subscribers to the Federal State institutions of Germany and the Robert Koha Institute.
In Russia, a technology of identification of persons was introduced to identify quarantine offenders.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera reported that cellular network operators reported that “40 per cent of the people are still moving across the territory”.
The Government of Germany held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon, in which more than 42,000 participants participated.
The President of Estonia, Kerst Kalloyd, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may be stressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic downturn are ideal conditions for harm to the mental health and well-being of people”.
The disease may have mild or absent symptoms that resemble other common upper respiratory diseases, such as ordinary colds.
Patients with mild disease usually recover within two weeks, while treatment of patients with severe or critical forms may take between three and six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of having a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although no COVID-19 data are available. Some COVID-19s may cause pneumonia as a complication.
People with the most severe disease of COVID-19 may rapidly progress in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory insufficiency, septic shock or polyorgan insufficiency.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal thromboembolism, as well as heart problems, kidneys and liver.
Thromboembolism abnormalities, especially prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while renal function was impaired in 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 had elevated liver enzymes (transamines).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to intensive care was seven days.
According to studies of early-stage cases, the mean time between initial symptoms and death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent among women.
Histopathological studies of the death samples of the lungs indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
Pneumocytes have seen viral cytopathic changes.
The appearance of the light resembled an acute respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were associated with increased levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had prior health problems and the availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary as a result of these regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequately effective accounting of cases in easy form could lead to an overstatement of mortality.
Nevertheless, the fact that death occurs as a result of past diseases may mean that the current rate of death is undervalued.
In smokers, severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally 1.4 times more frequent, and these patients were about 2.4 times more in need of intensive therapy or died than non-smokers, and there were concerns about the effects of the disease in the long term.
An administration at Hong Kong found that some patients who recovered from the disease had reduced the volume of the lungs by 20-30 per cent and that their scans had been damaged.
After recovery, this can also lead to Intensive Therapy Syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who recovered from the virus developed permanent immunity against it.
According to other coronaviruses, this is considered to be probable, but it has also been reported that after the recovery from COVID-19 tests on coronavirus, the tests on coronavirus were still positive.
In these cases, it is considered that there has been an accelerated prolonged period of disease rather than a recurrence of contamination.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
The first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, are referred to as the earliest date of the first case on 1 December 2019.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and the time when the disease is spreading, and are also influenced by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems used by treatment schemes, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the population, such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO allocated emergency codes for ICB-10: U07.1 — for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 — for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection — the number of deaths attributed to the number of cases diagnosed during a certain period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153 822/ 240 191).
This figure varies from region to region: some other methods include the definition of disease-related mortality (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, as well as the determination of the death rate as a result of the transferred infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect indicators of a particular segment of the population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced by all infected patients, the presence of such antibodies suggests how many people have been infected.
At the outbreak epicentre in Italy, Castillon d'Ad, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the town of Gangelit, the disease was spreading during the celebration of a carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies based on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates varies between men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, male mortality rates are higher.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gender gap only decreases from 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this difference are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-specific immunological differences, the lower incidence of smoking among women associated with male diseases (e.g., hypertension in men younger than women) may cause higher male mortality.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 occurred in men.
As of April 2020, the United States Government has not maintained gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ORVI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease COVID-19.
The WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adán Gerreissus, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI”, “virus”, “D”, “ Disease” (disese), and 19 when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by international recommendations on names aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, WHO further uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus”.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as “coronavirus”.
During the initial outbreak in Uhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as “coronavirus” and “Uhank coronavirus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical sites in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “ acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of the virus and disease.
Official names “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limited volume of standard supply chains, some producers of digital services print medical materials, such as nose swabs, as well as parts of IWL equipment.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time, then one of the local productions was redesigned and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and fae information on the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the virus began to be widely disseminated on the Internet.
Probably people can infect other animals.
Studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At present, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or medicinal products for its treatment.
Various international studies of vaccines and drugs from COVID-19 are currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial program, which aims to assess the healing effect of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine-candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate into human cells through the ACE2 receptor, and therefore, research uses previous studies in the SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers seek to develop a whole virion vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at prompt human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that enhances the immune system's sensitivity to certain viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-speed protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA-vaccin, a new method of creating a vaccine).
The experimental vaccines developed for any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began in Seattle for four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code, copied from the virus, which causes the disease, and the anti-thelosive enhancement has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were assessed in seven tests, four of which were hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reprofiling of antiviral drugs is a large part of Chinese research; by the end of April nine studies on remdesivire were carried out in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for treatment with COVID-19 was carried out. To this end, several other existing antivirals for treatment with COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, in combination with interferon beta, were also considered.
As at March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivri were available.
Clinical improvement was seen in patients receiving remdesivire as an exception.
The phase III of clinical trials is already in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment was considered in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
Nevertheless, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
Korea and China health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling the dose is very dangerous and may result in a lethal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA authorized the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of China also indicated interferon, ribavirin or umifenevir as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxaneide was recommended for in vivo careful study by demonstrating low concentrations inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that through interaction with ACE2 receptor, a serum beam beam (TMPRSS2) is required.
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further investigation. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in treatment with COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinaemia may occur as a complication at late stages of severe COVID-19 form.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may possess the properties of hypercytokinaemia, as a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
This medicine has taken 2 stages of a non-randomized test at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained from patients with severe disease.
In combination with an analysis of ferritin blood serum to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA was approved by the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies to treat steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, T-cell therapy CAR.
To date, there has been no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective means of treating cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to those in need is currently considered a non-vaccinating passive immunization method.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients with SARS, but its results have not been conclusive.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are under development.
The use of reconvalescent serum blood may be increased, consisting of a liquid portion of the blood of recovering patients and containing antibodies against the virus.
Coronavir disease, highly similar syndromes
Lee Wenlan, a doctor at Uhan's central clinic, who later became infected and died from COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
