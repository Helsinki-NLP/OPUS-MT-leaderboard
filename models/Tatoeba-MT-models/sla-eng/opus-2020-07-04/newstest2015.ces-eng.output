Peter Čech: Pass for the last minute?
Anything is possible.
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big step.
Another chance comes in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently the replacement goalkeeper of Chelsea, does not now sit above the new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting in the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talking to Czech journalists and is preparing a Czech representation for the game general with Americans and then also for the sharp start of qualification of Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In the new season, the Premier League wins Thibaut Courtois in Chelsea, Czech for the first time in ten years in London’s club, he becomes a substitute.
Some time ago, there was speculation that real Madrid might be interested in Bohemia.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup at the beginning of the season in battle with the Atlétic and couldn't even get into the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He lost two prizes and two draws in the season of the French league, shot St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively push shoes club AS Monaco.
He's got a 1-1-2 balance sheet in the league so far, and he broke up with Lille 1-1 on the weekend.
News came out on Bulgarian English websites today that Czecha might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, Chech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet wrote course 4-1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that within the remaining few hours, you'll change the jersey?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything like that in football.
Maybe during the day, there's an offer that won't go away.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know how such an offer that can't be rejected actually looks.
It would have to be the agreement of all sides, first of all, that it would be up to Chelsea's position to decide whether or not any offer would be handled by the club.
Is it technically feasible to do such a step now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new arena?
I didn't think about it that way.
But there's a lot of players in this situation today, everyone's at a representative rally somewhere, and I'm sure there's still a lot of delays going on today.
So somehow realistic, I'm sure it would be.
How many clubs are on the planet that could afford you?
I really don't know.
And you're not pushing to leave?
The situation when I didn't catch the new season in the first three games is a new career for me after fifteen years.
However, there is no reason to panic, to be afraid and to go away.
I want to continue to participate in this battle for the position of goalkeeper Chelsea, and he is at the coach who chooses what decision he will make over the next weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision making?
I take all the factors into account.
It's important for me, of course, to have a sporty view, but I'm also looking at it from a personal site, which is, of course, what the needs of the family belong to.
Is it possible that you would catch another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never concern me with.
But everything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
The Prime Ministers of India and Japan to meet in Tokyo

According to the rapporteurs, India also hopes that the two nations will agree to cooperate on defence issues.
Carrat police arrested a 20-year-old young man after a motorcycle chase
The engine was stopped after a zone with a maximum speed of 70 km/h had driven 125 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the police.
The guarding traffic police tried to stop the blue bike at the border in Carrat this morning when they noticed that they were driving 125 km/h from the Bathgate Road pump.
According to the police, the driver didn't stop and continue after Burgess Road and then move into the bush, so the cops lost him out of sight.
The engine and the person matching the driver's description were then seen at the house in Waltcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Carrathian police accused a 20-year-old young man of disobeying the call to stop and conduct recklessly.
He'll be court-martialed on 23rd September.
The bike was confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be brought to trial for assaulting women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was acquainted with the charges during the hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
Apparently, on June 7, 2013, at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in the county of Perthshire, he had to rape a woman.
According to Webster, he attacked her while “she was not conscious, asleep and unable to give her consent.”
In addition, Webster is being prosecuted for rape by other women at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn at the Scottish Highlands from 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of the trial at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Renewing a very American ideal that labour rights are human rights at the same time
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect union organisations as civil law.
"According to the workings of the unions, jobs for the middle class are functioning," says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, co-chair of the Congress Committee.
That is why I am so proud to be able to present the law strengthening the position of employees, together with the model of the occasional rights of John Lewis.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal options as to prevent discrimination in union organisation as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-selective forces.
Amend the Labour Relations Act in such a way as to allow all workers facing discrimination, if they want to be involved in a union, to be tried in a civil court - and to judge compensation or compensation for damage - is an appropriate and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other lawmakers are proposing is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that took place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to embrace, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them when the land of one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to gather.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their trade unions played a role in forming a new Japan, included the language and openly acknowledged that “the right of workers to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that they would need to organize and promote in the new nation and therefore included a clause that openly says: “The right to create societies that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and every profession or profession.
Arrangements which will restrict or seek to harm this right will be repealed. The measures leading to this purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the drafters and Roosevelt guarantee included in it that "everyone has the right to form and join trade unions in the protection of his interests."
The Americans of the entire generation have accepted the basic assumption that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries, how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to set up labour unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and enforce in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the unions of the power of the nation did not diminish, but expanded it.
They raised the standard of living of millions of people, created the market for industry and production, raised to an unscrupulous level.
Those who attack the union forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellis and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that have raised America and made it a real promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could have closed all the abortion clinics in Louisiana.
On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisiana Law, which according to lawyers would likely have closed all five clinics carrying out abortions in the state.
A regulation prohibited by the signature of the Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors performing abortions to have the right to accept a patient in the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The resolution of the judge means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and, in the meantime, must obtain this authorisation.
"The proposing party will be able to carry out its activities legally and in the meantime to obtain a permit," said Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution concerning the law.
Activists for the right to revoke the resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision ensures to the women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the fail-safe law to prepare them for health and their rights," said Nancy Northupová, president and executive director of the Reproductive Rights Centre, who, on behalf of three out of five clinics, insisted that the bill be blocked.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision involved doctors from two clinics who were not among the complainants and also requested the authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have passed similar laws, while the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures anti-constitutional.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Women's rights fighters, together with the Association of American Birth and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permission places requirements on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Apostates of abortion were opposed by measures aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed due to measures.
The reproductive rights centre stated that in Louisiana only one doctor carrying out abortions had permission.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also, in fear of their safety, stop the procedure, said the group.
In response, the Louisiana authorities stated that they would not punish doctors who execute abortions while waiting for an application to grant rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer is more likely to be killed in the countryside
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of their late mother holding hold that died of ovaries cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than from their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovaries cancer and found that only 35 % five years after diagnosis lived.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute stated that women in rural and remote areas of the country were about 20 percent more likely to die than women in urban areas during the study.
SMALL STUDIES: New medicines can slow lung and ovaries cancer
Researchers observed women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival affected the age of women during diagnosis, the type of ovaries cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest rate of survival was observed in elderly women who had cancer diagnosed in an advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die in the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors may be a late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease can best treat gynecooncologists, who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite improvements in distance medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distances, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that enable specialists to treat women closer to their homes and programmes to support people who are being treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and prevention programmes.
A research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer is published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a young mother from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of egg cancer in her 33 years.
Garden Centres regret the reduction in the number of homeowners
According to a study published by the Financial Times of HTA, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of property owners under the age of 35 could lead to the loss of up to ten million pounds a year by the young generation of consumers today.
According to the report, people who rent their own homes spend on average 55% of the amount they spend on their own.
As further threats to the sector, estimated at £5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of the pre-garden space used as a parking space and the decreasing garden size is cited.
In the area of Greater London, where the share of owned houses dropped from 61% in six years to 43%, the lowest expenditure on horticultural products in Britain is the household.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society have stated that living in the rented area or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the main gardener adviser for RHS, said: “For tenants there is a very popular plant cultivation in flower plants – when they move, plants can take with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and resulted in a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity going on between the 1980s and the mid-1990s.
Also for this year, he predicted a higher withdrawal due to better weather that came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator speaks of democracy.
After Putin, at the reunion of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all, Hitlerjugend, he seized atomic weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that their views were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of the Fascist state.
Great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be controlled by both nationalism and that the complex of inferiority can transform into imperialism.
Time in the east is probably different than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the era of war over Europe had long been gone, in the east it felt that they had been ignored for a long time and that it was necessary to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the power of the Nazis was captured, followed by the outbreak of nationalism, a similar situation today in Russia.
And then that completely consistent cult of a strong leader, beating journalists, eliminating dissensive political opponents, discriminating minorities and homosexuals, that is, quite similar.
Vladimír Putin and most of the Russians are probably missing after Russia ruled half the world and the second part shook before them.
Maybe the Western politicians blamed themselves, maybe few Vladimír were slapping his shoulders, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted to go, and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made order at home, pretended that he didn't even want to go anywhere, and he broke knives at home.
Now he decided to take back the lost position.
He'll start slowly, he'll have time.
The leader's probably in life, so he'd be in a hurry.
Kavkazani was snooped, and now the Ukrainians are going down, and then they're the Dwarves of Pobalt.
They've been pinching Russian bears in the fur for a long time.
I'm sure China's already going to notice it, and it's kind of jumping up and down, and it's definitely getting a lock on the far east.
And those Germans of Vladimír also had a nice relationship with how well they were doing, and that's what I put on their ass at 45.
Let's make one new Novorosi in Karlovy Vary.
That would be a base, and there are a lot of ours there, and how they're being oppressed and the house was already trying to break up with the Lecter.
Our veterans have remembered how they were doing in Czechoslovakia so far.
Well, as their Prime Minister, Mr Sobotka, is so soft, it can be peeled like onions and I will eat all their EU.
That's how they'd play so they'd jump out on big Russia.
They need to be reminded where they belong.
And as explosives, we'll use our compatriots who live on their territory.
The Russians are enough everywhere, and when they're told they're being oppressed, they're just being oppressed, and we're not leaving them behind, we're going to protect them.
And the Russian will rule again, for what else is he born to be.
Europe is only good as a preposition to which proud Ivan can dance a Cossack.
Turkey summons US diplomat for spying report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on US and British spying activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that US charge d'affaires and Turkish government officials were working on the report on Monday.
Germany's Der Spiegel magazine and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to documents provided by former US National Security Agency analysts, Turkey was a priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media outlets, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made the report important and said that all major states are watching each other.
An elderly report, according to which German intelligence services have also targeted Ankara, sparked a more bitter reaction with the Turkish government.
The series Game of Thrones introduced the other tricks of the fourth row
The gamers of thrones are currently filming the episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the tricks of the fourth row were formed.
The most visible are the computer adaptations of the serial environment and mass scene, when a giant army of famed Daenerys becomes a stream of soldiers.
Police Director in Magaluf charged with corruption
The complainants submitted evidence on Friday to the Office of the Mallory State Prosecutor about the kidnapping of police officers and civil servants of the Calvia City Hall.
The director of the police in Calvia on the Mallorca holiday island was arrested after charges against the elevated businessmen and bar owners in the notorious party district in Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street where most bars and night businesses in Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's Internet daily, the complainants of the Malloro Prosecutor's Office were presented on Friday with evidence of police and government officials being blackmailed in the Calvia district.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police for connection with the corruption charges, and together with Navarre, they will be heard by the judge.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted the disgruntled owners of night businesses as favouring public officials with a serious impact on their business.
"It has long been not about making money, but about surviving," one of the entrepreneurs said in court.
Don't mess with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got to the main pages of magazines around the world after a video of 18-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, which during the tour of bars provided oral sex to 24 men.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to monitor drunkards and rioters in a number of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious alcohol tours around bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organizers of the Carnage Bar tour, to pay a fine of EUR 55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol accidents, including a fashion wave known as “balconing”, where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day was marked by the rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide airport
JARO brought South Australia an ice surprise, with heavy rain and a steep wind that seriously hit Adelaide airport.
The next 5 mm of precipitation in the city is due to drop into nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced together with a few short excesses connected with the storm and wind waves, which began eight o’clock in the evening and brought nearly 4 mm of precipitation within about 10 minutes.
After a few early doses of spring came in the winter last week, the city’s temperature dropped again at only 15.8 °C on Monday.
It is believed that storm weather has contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft was to land shortly after 19:30, but at a short distance it was affected by a change in wind speed or direction and the landing was forced to delay.
The winds at Adelaide airport at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.
The flight data showed that the plane had to leave since the second landing and ended up about 8:40 p.m.
The delay in the aircraft resulted in the delay of additional flights, including the flights of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Qantas from Sydney.
It is predicted to reach one or two excesses on Tuesdays in Adelaide at a maximum temperature of 16 °C.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending summers in bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50 - day war between Israel and Hamas.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still evident.
In Ashdod, a town in the south of the country, the staff of a shell that was hit by a rocket removed the remains from the wall after the shrubs and slowly await the return of the children.
"We are a little scared, but otherwise we are looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibucu Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart told her that it was "a little strange" to go to school all of a sudden.
"We've had a few tough moments and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support.
Until the fires stopped last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad stayed inside their homes or their homes left and went to safer areas away from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, in which a fire from a Palestinian mortar killed a four-year-old boy, with a return weight.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families still did not return.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study, and he added: "We shall provide you with education and safety."
Last Tuesday, Israel and Hamas agreed on a time-limited peace.
Although the halting of the fire led to an immediate cessation of the fighting, it did not solve key problems as a requirement for Hamas to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and to reopen airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarming of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two fallen soldiers in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to start later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radical, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired during the fighting on Israeli cities primarily on the south of the country 4,591 rockets and mortar missiles.
The Israeli army again carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and estimated 250,000 people hid in hundreds of United Nations schools that had turned into a surveillance shelter.
For tens of thousands of people who are still in hiding, and due to the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed last week at the beginning of the school year.
"I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete our education just like Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in Gaza's largest city.
I'm behind Vácho.
And the Lafatu is suffering from a fever.
The Czech football team met earlier this afternoon in Prague before the midterm preparatory match with the US and the subsequent initial match of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of the 23-member frame, David Lafat, a partner, has problems with fever.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David's still a little bit of a problem.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible," said coach Pavel Vrba to the press.
"If it's two or three days, or it'll be fit tomorrow, it'll be seen according to his medical condition, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Absolutely someone has some kind of pain, but it's not like they couldn't train or participate in a fight Wednesday with the US," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday night, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan backer Lukaš Vachu.
He admitted that it was not easy to make decisions, but other pioneers were.
I made a decision based on the fact that Lukas is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
It was a very difficult decision, but I am behind it," Vrba told Vach.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latato.
It is not excluded that, in the case of health problems, nominations could still change.
On the weekend with great performance he glistened, for example, the liberian Josef Šural, who gave Hattrick.
Of course there are players who have recently shown the form.
Let's see how David Lafat is doing.
In the event that he is not able to be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot dominate any of the players who took part in the Czech League," Vrba commented.
This afternoon there is a training session in Strahov, then on Tuesday, a classic pre-war training exercise in front of a US duel in Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The match with the Americans takes place on Wednesday at 8:15 p.m., and the national team in it will strive for the Prime Minister's victory under the Vrbo.
In the previous three preparatory games, he played two remissions and lost once.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on the programme of 9 September from 20:45.
Walking in the Netherlands to Italy
The Willows like to have more time to practice than they did before.
There is an advantage when you have a player for eight days and you can practice with them certain things on which we may not have had so much time before.
Now we can only focus on getting ready for the Netherlands as soon as possible," said Vrba.
The Dutch will introduce themselves on Thursday in Italy before the match in Prague, and the duel will personally follow the former temporary representative coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us information that's from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a game and we're gonna have to discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to very monitored statistics, the housing prices in the winter period have increased most over the last seven years.
According to the housing index in the Australian capital, Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased housing prices by 1.1% in August, the Agency stated on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase in July, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices rose to 10.9%, more than twice one year by August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless stated that Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
Figures of RP Data show that housing prices in Sydney increased by 16,1 % last year, while prices in Melbourne increased by 11,7 %.
Other of the strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other hand, the scale was set up by Canberra, which was damaged by the State's ordered expenditure reduction and where prices only increased by 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a real test for the market.
“In view of the continuing high level of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the low interest rate, it is likely that the housing value will increase even further over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, who worked at the factory, had a cooler relationship.
Henry is testing the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melodies is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with a few unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through "deep" therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice say: “Stop this noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were adults - went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never spoken to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner reading the papers.
Recently, Henry visited Dudley's founder, and although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he saw what kind of life he had to be for him.
There's a little bit more light in there today, but it's still dark, and it's full of smoke, and it's still in the dark, and it's got a cloudy labyrinth where the flames explode, and there's a lot of smoke and it's sauerkraut.
Dad always got in the tub and he was just lying there, and then it was like he was starting to sing for himself, 'cause he's laughing at the watermelon.
When I walked by, I realized that he'd been doing this for years to enjoy his family, and I started to respect him more.
Yet Henry lived a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't marry anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, and Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying, "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
French, married for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of weight and started showing signs of diabetes, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And tired.
No one wants to eat the carrot itself.
The change in direction of taking Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After he got credit for criticizing Othell, he dived into the theater.
It was followed by a comedy full of mistakes and the fences of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedies who filled out his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on stage, parodie someone, and he wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “I was the only black impersonator/comist on TV in the long term.”
He's been studying for the march.
Besides having to notice me in public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to make jokes, be a star and perform on television, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, the entertainment program in which the actors dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed with his comedy for five years.
My family was no longer married because of that.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with a crowd.
What was “years and years appreciated by the main product of British television” was also“the grotesque parody of blacks”.
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced figures that at the same time ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting its first series in 1984, and in the 1990s he was also known as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy show Chef!
For the next decades, he was taken by commercials, papers, TV shows and film roles, but after sending his program Lenny Henry.tv to the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what you're going to do now, Len, it seems like you're stuck in one place, or you're out of the way a little bit."
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first one was Shakespeare.
I had some serious allergies to Shakespeare.
We didn't really study him at school, and I thought it was something for the white high school.
So I was worried about it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave 20 lines of Othell's final speech for the document, and he's already done it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it's giving me courage.
"That's what it is. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the trial was hard, and before that, I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he began playing in comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was in the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical malfunction, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for confiscating the public.
“A voice in my head said, ‘Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them now for ten minutes.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Hmm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You play, so stay in character."
Henry in Plotech at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Plots was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it's giving you a lot of determination.
The game was also well received, so it is like a sign of God that says, "You should do this."
Of course, that's what he says by his own voice.
So I'm staying here.
I really like it.
I'm glad I'm in the test room.
Henry still has the mind of a comedian - our entire conversation is interrupted by humorous performances when he comes in and comes out of the role of an immitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do live at the Apollo, but I don't like it the way I used to.
I asked if he'd ever set up a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps to give up features of the beginning, the means and the end of the journey - I don't think I would ever give up.
So, your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm enjoying acting.
It's fun.
You're still telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to lighten on non-existent employees
Kenya began with biometric registration of all its civil servants in order to try to remove a non-existent government employee from the payroll.
According to a government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will cease to be paid out.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after they have left the state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhur Kenyatt promised to stop corruption in state administration.
The audit carried out this year has shown that the state spends at least one million dollars ($700,000) a month on salaries of non-existent employees and on further abuse of official power.
The government suspects that payments are continued on bank accounts even after an employee has died or after the employee leaves the government, said BBC reporter from the capital city of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All civil servants must reach the identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be recorded biometrically, it shall be stated in a government statement.
He goes on to say that anyone who fails to make an apology without sufficient excuse will be removed from the payroll.
"The appointment of real public service employees will make a significant contribution to its commercialisation and will also be used to clean up the pay-as-you-go documents at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waigura, the Ministry's secret to development and planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for “screaming” against the government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey for suspicion of a "poisoning against the government".
The police office has yet to comment on the case.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking officials detained.
Some of them were involved in the December corruption investigation, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organising criminal gangs and telephone wiretaps.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the influence of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer break.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and Prime Minister Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the present press that not all schools had reopened, but that the country was determined to defend for the next generation:
Not all schools had traditional 1st dawn ceremonies.
Not all of Ukraine has peace.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a schoolteacher in Slavjansk, visited by Jaceňuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, maybe the BBC found a hard time boss.
It brings with it the clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclaves of conservative parties.
Sam's got experience in the front lines.
She began her career in the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when Pearson's senior parent company occupied her younger colleague.
It's said that her severance was approaching a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former Director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed private expertise: she became a government adviser.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's work as a kalych with poison.
Not only is the BBC an extensive and online entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside the top layer of the hierarchy of the BBC's own leadership, but also out at the public's voice in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that demands a thorough reform.
But the director would risk coming to a company complex as a Chinese dynasty, decomposing it, making it his own job.
It's a difficult challenge.
If it wasn't that hard, a lot of people would love to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and how its status is being revised.
With the expansion of the competition circuit and new technology questioning old security, it brings with it immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC at great risk.
For a modest amount of 145.50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share of what is certainly the world's largest media enterprise.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production is 96% of households and each one costs only 40pn per day.
In addition, the BBC popularity is clearly rising: 53% of the supporters compared to 31% 10 years ago.
Models of using BBC services have changed: Today the headlines appear on my mobile phone and I can look at the IPlayer for the shows I missed.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says the insulting tweet has not been approved.
Tweet from the official twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, published on Sunday, contained an insulting picture of a democratic state representative who initiated Perry's criminal charges of abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another was published on Perry's account, which was separated from the previous one.
A tweet has left my account that has not been authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and downloaded it," he said in his next post.
Perry's assistants didn't respond to questions right away.
Although tweets have been sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unquenchable, humorous picture of state representative Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay the funds for her office, making Perry, a possible presidential candidate in the 2016 elections, this month brought a grand jury to Austin.
The tweet said: “I don’t always drive three times the blood alcohol level beyond the limit allowed... but if I do, I will sue Governor Perry for responsibility. ”
I'm the hottest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, Special Prosecutor of San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and the charges were called tactical, political maneuvers.
His qualified legal team has asked the investigating judge to dismiss the charges, because the use of the laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is counter-constitutional.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the state fund to the Public Interest Department, which has a headquarters in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection sparked a formal complaint by a left-wing group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it'll be celebrated.
After he finished fifth in the committee of his party during his presidential campaign in 2012 in Iowa, Perry responded to speculation that he could end up with a tweet with a photo of his own running near the lake, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns "to normal"
One of London's most prominent development companies warned that the housing market in southeastern England had "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices and increased concerns from the credit bubble led the Bank of England in June to set limits on mortgages.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley’s demanding client company, said on Monday: “From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from the top point in 2013 to the normal level of transactions.” He adds that it provides a ‘stable environment for functioning’.
London’s housing market was doing well during the fall, as buyers from abroad sailed into the capital.
According to data from the cadastral office, last year alone, prices in the city jumped by 18.5%, far ahead of averages of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average selling prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and rose to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the growing librarians, in recent months the foreign buyers of London are not so attractive - some of them also threatened to introduce new property taxes and talk about possible ‘seide tax’ with which politicians came before the next May parliamentary elections.
The London Real Estate Office of Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which presented stricter rules for loans, would also slow down during the second half of the year the growth of the market for both real estate and price sales.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages per month in July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
The Hamptons International, another real estate office, has reduced on the basis that home prices have already begun to decline, its forecast of London real estate prices to 3% in 2015.
The volume of transactions according to WA Ellis real estate office in London’s most expensive districts, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, decreased by a quarter each year.
Nevertheless, the demand for housing in the capital for Berkeley was a blessing, as it increased cash for forward sales to over 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-looking housing in a good location remained the same and therefore the forward sale continued.”
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the 2007 crisis.
Annual profit before tax increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, yields by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday, before the annual meeting of Pigley, he said that he expected Berkeley's annual returns to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be 450 million pounds.
The Berkeley stock stopped at the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at 23.96 pounds.
Hacker posted photos of the naked Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th edition of the Academy Prize.
The photos of Oscar Jennifer Lawrence's holder leaked to the Internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a "single" photo of another hundred starting actresses.
The speakers of the movie "Hunger Games" confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence were true and hacker criticized for "a manifest violation of privacy."
The authorities have already contacted and will pursue anyone who stole photos of Jennifer Lawrence will publish.
Hacker photos, which were originally published on the server for sharing pictures 4chan, allegedly gained thanks to the boundary in the internet storage system Apple iCloud. The reported list of hacked victims by BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who are watching the photos we took in private homes years ago," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known for the Nickolodeon “iCarly” and “Victorious” series, denied that the photos would be true. On Twitter, she said: “These are my supposed naked photos, people.”
It's better to cut it even in the crucifix.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the speaker pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photographs would be true.
An extraordinary demonstration of the celebrated new novel by Howard Jacobson about love and the letter ‘J’
They disbanded, that's the best way to describe it, gradually decomposed as a cardboard box that someone left on the rain.
From time to time, some woman told him that he was too serious, too complicated, too steep, isolated, and perhaps a little puzzling.
And then she shook his hand.
He let it go.
He knew how to fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of his ability was the beginning of a love ring, which more than usual promised to relieve him of his lonely boredom and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Alinan Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild warm hair and a heart flying from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and hospitable than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited her possessions in a wet but beautiful valley called, conveniently, Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The pipes leaked, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the snails slipped onto the windows as if they thought it belonged to them, the garden was overgrown and weeds resembled huge sticks of cabbage.
The house looked like a cabin of children's stories, scary and yet charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” is on the preliminary nomination list for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailenn were sitting on the sofa chairs in the long grass and holding hands, enjoying an unexpected warm spring afternoon, unwittingly tuned up the public station, which the region provided with comforting music and soothing news, when his father remembered the long forgotten black comic song, which his father liked to listen to when he saw her burning cross legs.
You have too big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, they no longer played such songs on radios.
They weren't banned - there was nothing really forbidden - they just weren't playing.
They helped them get into a decade, just like the word desuetudo itself.
Human taste has proved what could never be done by regulations and position outside the law, and just as people in books choose memoirs in which poor people become rich, cooks and love novels, so in music there are balads.
Kavern got up in the day and started playing the imaginary piano and the rude, comic voice he sang the serenade of Ailli's big feet.
Ailenn didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to the lips.
That's what his father always did when he tried to suppress the letter j before he came out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him that the game was playing with his father.
When you put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't very funny anymore, and it wasn't even funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailenn's never heard one.
Even though he wasn't built out of the law, they didn't play.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There was only one place in life for one "if."
When she started playing tunes, people wanted to know exactly where she would end up.
Same with humor.
His indiscretion has made people nervous.
And jazz was the humor expressed by a song.
Although he didn't hear from Sammy Davis Junior until ten years ago, he knew Kevern jazz from his father's half secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to tell me Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she could not remember the time when favorite singers were not black.
No laws or pressure either.
The lawful society is one in which every part of it is grateful - with the gratitude of those who have been happy by chance of saving - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution were used for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from India's subcontinent, as if the nature of the electronics supply, have assumed responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a functional phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed were washing dishes.
Those of the Gulf States and Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while doing what they had been doing, when they feared that they had been accused of putting them into the fire, were afraid that the fire would be eating them - they opened up a restaurant where they sold flax and smoked water chimneys, they did not pay attention to themselves and the inaction slowly fed them.
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the balloons, Ailenn could hardly understand how out of the dirty words that Kavern had just sang to her, music could come about.
Music was an expression of love.
"In fact, they are not rude," said Kevern.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
No word could have escaped from behind the soundcards.
Ailenn still didn't get it.
Why would your father like that?
He was saying it was a joke, but he hesitated to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence again.
She thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said eventually.
She shook her head unbelievably and blocked Kevern's view.
In the whole wide world, there was nothing more to see than the mess of her crashing hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think about it," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't walk that far.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because I have too many fat ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are just attracted to me," he tried.
I'm kind of sick.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to curb the cruelty that was in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel to Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailin Solomons came up from the bed, dropped the radio and spilled undried wine.
It's unfermented wine, so it wasn't a drink.
She seemed to shake like palm leaves in a storm in her wake.
"I'm sickly attracted to you as a fool," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes the moment she stood up to him.
She thought she'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about her life on the cold north peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was the same on the ground as it was here.
The same wide and icy ocean was shaking against them.
The same deranged men, then, WHAT IS STALO, even more insensitive and grumpier than their ancestors, smugglers and corrupters, have wandered madly from the pub to the pub, ready to lay hands on any woman who would dare to refuse or laugh at them.
Stupid?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First, anointing it - anointing it became the most common expression for erotic teasing between a man and a woman: an antibody to the faint ballads of love, which the radio hysterized - first anointed it, then one killer.
According to Kever's opinion, too much cultivation, because the anointing was an act of violence in itself.
Ailin Solomons, she's never meant to leave him.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt tired herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched her walk away - as if she was watching him from the window on the floor - the man she caught up with who made him.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart broke because of him and all the men in general, no matter how many of them killed her.
The man turned away from her, his arms hanging, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel that she knew this sight well, even though she couldn't imagine a moment until today that she would ever see it again?
Aileen Solomons, on her own, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and enthusiastic twenty-four-year-old researchers working in Ofnow, the non-static public mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and medium-sized violent acts in areas where its mitigation or direct cessation was most expected if enough money and energy were spent on its removal.
"A lot has been done and much still has to be done," she wrote, "to calm the innate aggression of people who fought in many battles and most of them won, especially in the desperate, hard-to-reach places of the country, where despite the tops of the church towers standing over the living fences of the inspiration of human kindness has rarely appeared."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the poodles.
Residents sigh over sentimental balads, swallow up unfortunate stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only do they hold old brutality as hard as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that there are new and offensive intolerances at home, in the workplace, in the streets, in the sports field and even in the sports field.
"Unfortunately you tend to be too Mayan style," her supervisor said.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I feel that I don't have to answer," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme regained her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"I am not asking," Rabinowitz said at last, "that I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unbound companies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which is totally acceptable and praiseworthy of itself, can at times distort judgment as you have done.
Obviously, you yourself are biased towards the church - the things you call “cruel” and“brutal” could also be interpreted as expressions of natural power and energy.
Still dealing with what happened, when it happened, as if it had happened, yesterday, it was preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the light board was a pink blotter of recommendations that Ofnow had been sending to the world for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile for your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the balloons, go to the musicals, use your phone, convert, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak is better than to keep quiet, a song word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I totally understand your reservations," said Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure that her supervisor had finished, "and I'm not saying that the wound didn't heal in the way we conjured her recovery.
My main concern is that if we are not notified in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened, where that happened.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips.
That would mean infinite patience.
"You are going too far," he said, "if the steps they may have taken and may not have done your grandparents, you describe them as mistakes.
You are also far too far away when you talk about them venting their “anger ” and“ distrust” on the “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that, in understanding the past and protecting the presence, we are not talking about "us" and "them."
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is that it was a chaotic time.
"By those who, if we are honest with each other," Esme took courage, "we are not blameless.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this together.
And just as there is no guilt that could be seduced, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the correction is appropriate and possible.
But what's the use of the past than learning from it?
The past exists for us to forget.
If there's anything I can do about it...
Luther Rabinowitz has broken the fingertips.
"I will take your report into account," he said and released it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her on the sidewalk in a way that the passers-by described as "grossy and furious."
Accidents happen.
The Lesoth Kingdom Army claims no plan - Prime Minister stays in South Africa
The military officers of the Kingdom of Lesotho denied that they were organizing a coup to overthrow the government, claiming to have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said the army had surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
After he declared that he was threatened with death, the prime minister and his family went to the neighbouring Republic of South Africa.
Major Ntle Ntoi, speaking army, said that it was not really about the coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police tried to arm themselves.
"Today, the command of the defence components of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several reports of information services, that there are several groups in the ranks of the police that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who are going to make a push in the country," the Voice of America said.
The South African government, Clayson Monyel, spoke of military action as an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Though no one has claimed to have taken power from the government, the actions of the forest defence forces seem to carry a sign of coup d'état," he said.
The military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho said that the soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday and that peace was at stake in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane stated that, in his opinion, the attack was the result of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended the Parliament for internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He declared that despite the contrary, his actions did not undermine the government.
Euro area production is at 13 months minimum
Production growth has slowed to a minimum of 13 months, according to a closely monitored survey in the euro area in August.
The Euro Area Shopping Managers Final Index (PMI) from June 51.8 went down in August to 50.7.
A number higher than 50 means expansion.
New orders and factories have been lost to the growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The numbers come from the European Central Bank (ECB) Thursday meeting.
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the remote recovery of the euro area and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating to 0.3%.
Speculation emerged that the ECB Director Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that it is considering the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to the one the United Kingdom and the United States entered during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the brake effect, which has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer, is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, the main economist Markit.
Germany’s production PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 11 months.
In France's second largest economy, PMI fell to 46.9.
There's concern about France, and Italy's gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to bring oil into the fire to analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI increased to 57,3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist in IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to do about the manufacturing overview of purchasing managers for August, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
Added: Euro zone manufacturers are currently having a very complicated life because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the increasingly demanding conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has been demonstrated - particularly consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those expensive ones.
He said that as "more likely", it appears that the ECB will eventually have to do some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten Years of Hell of Survivors From Beslan: Ten Years of Fear From Having School Still Suffering
Ten years ago, Chechen radicals at Beslan School in southern Russia were held hostage by thousands of people
During the three - day suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We returned to Beslan to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school
Just ten years after the horrendous establishment of a school in Beslan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, they warned survivors of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatic terrorist children and parents were captured and murdered, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to tragedy brought the East and the West together, leading to action and the future in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school.
We found amazing young people who resisted calamity, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists in them will live on.
What is their greatest wish?
So that the war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is over.
Girl trying to get back into a ruined school gym.
It was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov as only in his underwear trying to get back into the bombed school gym after the bomb exploded.
The confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run away and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
I had blood on my feet.
I got up and came back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: “Before three months, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
I've got a piece of the shrapnel in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said decisively.
"It just happened to me, and it can't be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate, George Gapova, were killed there.
As a kid, we played together and we imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten her captivity, but memories get a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet as I climb through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, they'll understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia the children of the school began at the age of seven) and survived the three - day siege of the school in the hugging of his mother, Tamara.
At that time, the seven - year - old said: “My mother told me that if an explosion occurred, I should lie on the ground and hold her hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Flee."
He was afraid that she was dead, running, and on the way he saw a crying brat, grabbed the baby by his hand, and ran off with a shower of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother was dead. ”
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara made a run for freedom and was lying in a hospital with a broken leg, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the missing papers News of the World), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"This horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that memories are already faded.
I remember throwing all my guns at the game right after that.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I don't have a problem with it.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially the way I could choose anything in the toy store, and the way I drove a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where he suffers as much as he did his friends because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," said Damir, who took part in volunteering last week in the convent.
I want to help so much.
I want to work for the police one day, and I hope I'll be admitted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember that silence right after the attack, and there were no children screaming and running, and that silence took months.
He vividly remembers the journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and how they could express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the possibility of going to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damiro.
I remember Damir's taste for borsch, and so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them from a water pistol, and they were running and playing with him.
And that was only a month from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still don’t think the world has changed for the past ten years.
Now there's war in Ukraine, every day people die, and I think that it was, and there's going to be a lot of children killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people war is just something in the news they listen to when they're bored or doing something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what a terrible thing it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir's grown up and he's kind and quiet, he's not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember that, but he's very close to six schoolmates, and sometimes he goes to the gym and they light candles.
When he was smaller, he had trouble with it-- I remember how he once lay on a couch with his face turned away from us, and sometimes he lay there for hours.
He didn't sleep. He had his eyes open.
I also remember that he fired all his guns or other weapons to play. Damir's today 17, he's taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe I've been sure for hours that he's dead and that I'll never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw hell, and pieces of human bodies lay everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boy didn't have this hellish chance of surviving.
“I remember shouting “Damire, run, run!” but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives are different from others.
Grigorium Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Comfort: Survivors from Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with their mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigorij today
When he was running for life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, he was scared to death in his bloody face.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of adultery in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take his older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my little boy stayed there for three days alone," she remembered.
Not on our own because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's still harder to think and talk about it.
There won't be a day to remember that tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Grigoria's photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was eternal as a statue (right)
I remember the way Grigory was looking forward to school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he was alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino, there's even a statue of Grigoria's pay.
Grigory's looking at the picture, and we've got it hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that because of this picture, people around the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important that this never happen again.
"I doubt we will ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still under investigation, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing accident in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what the cause was?
This world is expecting something too bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
For us to forget a little bit, it takes tens of years.
It affected my health, I still feel it.
I had three or four years of nightmare attacks, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why, when September 1st comes, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
This year, I graduated from school and started studying medicine at Vladicavkawika University.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived, even though he was held at the foot of a murdering terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the foot of a murdering terrorist during the attack, yet he was able to survive
When the attack was in full force, he was caught trapped in a gym, sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it were yesterday," said Gregorius, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind my head.
Now I'm getting older and saying that children can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say, it's not true.
"In 2006, I went to a psychologist and I was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - year after - that was the first and the last time I joined the gym again.
I fainted.
I'm never going to go there again and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photos taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I've hurt myself, but I'm already walking normally.
But I still couldn't get in and study at the FBS Academy in Petrohrad, as I wanted.
I sent them my papers, including medical reports, and they told me that it was not possible.
My other favorite are animals, so I joined the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cat to cow".
He said: “I know that I will never tell my children about this.
It's not something children should know about, and it's not something they should experience anymore.
His mother, Marina, 42, stated: “This pain will be here all the time.
He's in there making it worse with his next anniversary.
I am taking part in commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It's got to be even stronger for him because he was there than I was.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful he gave it back to me, there are traces everywhere in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregory's a grown-up today, but he's taking on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's undergone several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say he's already overcame the 50 percent, but he can't get over it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed and the pain only worsens.
I've lost a lot of people I loved and loved.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift that God could give me, but it hurts me to lose the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows, who haven't remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is getting closer to our country now, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we've been one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could take all those rebels and throw them away, as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who took a special command to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaevu brings to a secure Russian special commando (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all
In 2004, the world caught a breath when a Russian police officer was taken out of his arms by a young Alyon.
The terrorists released her, but in captivity at the school gym, they left her a 30 - year - old mother, a ten - year - old sister, Kristina, and Brother Makhar.
Makhar, who was three years old at that time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and their new wife, Svetlana, has a girl named Kristina after a dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, does not remember the attack at all, and she grew up to be a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that “it’s a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from the memories he remembers on the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips how to get better photos and videos under water
If you are interested in taking pictures or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpixel AW120 or an outdoor camera of the type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these pictures to a family party with a couple of cameras, and they all cost less than $350.
It is no matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Further set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes exposure to the dark under water.
And before you go into it, see how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only set to 5 feet, another to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in both current and waterproof versions.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't work.
Compact cameras have LCDs that will help you make photos, but outsiders don't have them.
Even if you have LCD, under water it will be poorly visible and the composition of the image will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If a camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different exposure spread, use this.
Stay close to the level.
Deeper immerse the light significantly.
If possible, stay close to the level when taking pictures in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you will see.
Get close to the photographic object.
That's good advice, if you take pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dim light.
This is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle of lens, which means that if you want to fill the camera frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could transform things even into a huge organization like NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to alleviate the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife remembers that one of the people who sought his help was a MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and illness, patients in the throes are generally interested in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He faced the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient and his wife, Juliet, involved the grief.
He observed: “I want everything to happen sooner than later. ”
When Juliet went on a business trip a week, Lawson was unusual and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
His colleague did an X-ray on his chest.
He was skiing in the French Alps about two weeks ago.
The X-rays came in.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the carnivore or the emesis of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers receive lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer smoke.
But Mesothelioma is different.
Almost in all cases is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a construction fiber that has previously been described as "miracled", but now it is known to be lethal.
For most of us it was not difficult to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the use of asbestos in industry was banned.
Even at a time when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people, such as treasurers of isolation, builders, carpenters, and shipworkers, came into close contact with it.
The toxin used in industry in another era is hard to imagine today as a cause for concern.
Such selfishness is not in place.
The Mesothelioma epidemic in Britain appears to be at the forefront today.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year for this disease are twice the number of fatal car accidents.
Number of deaths per mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are only now experiencing its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999), is that it usually lasts several decades before the mesothelioma develops.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not concern just the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases he is still present in the homes where we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
Thus, the mesothelioma does not respect the social order, wealth, occupation or age.
The privileged cotton from London’s commercial homes after public schools does not represent a hiding place.
Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the storage facilities of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even lay down the isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he could come in contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in Guy's Hospital's basement corridors, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors and doormen used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he could answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and in whom he later appeared to mesothelioma in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis for so long is not common.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are sick with the same disease? ”
According to a leading British expert on mesothelioma Professor Julian Peta, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain occurs, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that he will die this way.

A quick look at the records of the court archives, which are often turned around and required compensation, shows how much the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June admitted by Marks & Spencer that she had exposed asbestos to Janice Allen out of care.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised the two clothing section stores - one of the places was a flagship company, a business on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for the M&S.
He's got two kids today who are over 20.
"Before that happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought in my dream that he might have anything to do with me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given thanks to its fibrosis structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the building.
Today, it is possible to find Chrysol, commonly known as white asbestos, in buildings.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO still consider it a "big health risk" that could cause death.
But more dangerous is brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (krokidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos and experts argue that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high occurrence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
The staff of Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in a flagship shop in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Peta’s work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His studies of patients argue that “a significant part of the cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment”.
A significant part of this exposure is caused by ‘current use and winding’ of buildings.
Looks like no one can be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government need not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that the service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose fatal fibers could be disrupted by something as harmless as "a strong current of air".
Ministers are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but in this case they may be the opposite of the truth.
Although Parliament's Directorate of Services has insisted that the Westminster Palace receive a "positive medical certificate", it is now estimated that it will take one million pounds and a few years of work for Parliament to take a thorough look at it, modernise electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 elections, Members will rather be sitting in the premises of Queen Elizabeth II's Conference Centre on Green Lions.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say whether this conflict will cost lives.
All they can do now is wait.
One person who was never able to determine when asbestos was exposed is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that asbestos was exposed to hospital work.
"I worked at a hospital where the presence of asbestos has been demonstrated," he says, "but in my case I cannot prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
Of course, he remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was overcome by something like a cold.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was just in the middle of an operation.
All of a sudden, I was shaking.
It came all at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wasn't gonna drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the rubble, the esophagus around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, there was no reason to think it was a mesothelioma.
He finally spent a month at home.
The confused doctors made an X-ray of his chest and introduced a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent to his lungs.
Still, they didn't have a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after training and breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms came to the OR and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott did not connect to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older, and at work he got into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the space between the sternum bed and the lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take anything," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, you were worried.
The biopsy results came between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with sisters from the Macmillan charity organization, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipe," he says.
For those who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest.
Thus, Mesothelioma is now beginning to deal with younger people who do not have a risk profession.
The most dangerous thermally isolated asbestos pipes were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, staff members who crossed the basement corridors between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as is often the case with Graham Abbott) certainly came in contact with the toxic substance.
As it turns out now, several decades after the war, the hospital was in a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is being removed to this day.
The students built Bunsen's Khan on asbestos mats
And it's not just the hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and councillors because of his excellent insulating and unflammable qualities.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry, the students built Bunsen's Khan on the asbestos mat.
There was a website dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things, such as floor tiles or roofs of shelters on tools in our homes, usually contained asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer representing Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos, which a woman suffering from mesothelioma was able to recall in the 1970 ’ s when the garden house was being demolished.
So be careful how you fight the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while before you know it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found out I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna live another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor's position to a patient's position.
As countless patients before him, he too remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have left?’
I was told 12 months.
I remember saying to myself: “Well, I’m not going to have another Christmas.
That's the way it is."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the mechanism itself is what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made of fine fibres.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers inhale, they can settle down in a rubble, a lung discharger.
Asbestos fibers are a nuisance and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were probably exposed to asbestos during hospital practice.
Asbesto needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “respiring alone pushes them to the edge where the extremities are located.
He's been invasive from the start.
In mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used in other types of cancer are not so much taken up.
Fever is discussed, for example, about the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, it would be worth a try.
Treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the debauchery," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
The cancer “does not respond to chemotherapy”, although it“ has some effect, ” but it does not cure.
"Sometimes there will be someone who survives lung cancer," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
Following the discovery of mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became individual support and advisor to equally affected people.
When they called, he said, "Good day, you've reached the cancer center."
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed four years ago and kept very active.
At the beginning of Abbott, they offered six cycles of chemo that would last four months, and probably would only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “has been able to show things in more optimistic light. ”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the Department of Breast Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for me to be sent to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application and have to approve his payment.
In order to get the best treatment available, the question of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments eventually fail, many patients face other financial concerns - about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're turning to the courts, and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgana with Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898 asbestos has been known to be harmful," Morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even its very small amounts could pose a health risk.
And this is where we meet the company's negligence.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but according to Morgan it was not a “full settlement” because Lawson couldn't definitely prove that the mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating the case, however, the spokesman Guy's Hospital confirmed that “the absolution in the incriminating basement section was removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Bringing the exposure of lethal asbestos to one company or place of performance - usually tens of years after what happened - turned out to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former jobs have changed owners or have failed.
Insurance records are missing.
And those who are now defending themselves with accusations have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if it is not possible to look after their former employer.
The law created a 350 million dollar financial reserve, which is paid by the insurance companies and which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80 % of the amount that the court would normally order them to settle - approximately 120 000 pounds.
Each year 300 successful requests are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like his mesothelioma patients, thinks 350 million pounds is a "good job".
"It is an agreement drawn up by insurance companies for insurance companies," she says, and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if it did not hit time and people with mesothelioma would be able to contact former employers and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "has had gaps".
But Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering too much and need help now," Penning said last December during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasura, thought had a positive effect.
After the surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed - triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski could boast of a survival rate of five years to 40% of patients.
Abbott made it stronger.
"This is not of course the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition may deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent an operation in March 2012.
He finished the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy in August.
Checkpoints showed no signs of disease.
I went to the next inspection in March [2014].
In my chest, I had multiple blood spatters.
My 50th birthday was just coming up.
It doesn't threaten life.
He's taking it.
Abbott again took six cycles of chemotherapy.
At present, there are no signs of a tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing the woman how the alarm works on the boiler.
When you hear bad news, you start to be negative.
You need to look ahead.
As Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie's been more stalled.
She didn't say much.
All patients with cancer have to face this kind of conversation.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such interviews are not relieved by hope or merely by a sign of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought Stephen Jay Gould) an unkind assurance.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not a threat to life. ”

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
In spite of the proliferation of the debate on democratic reform, the Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will trigger long-promised protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists have started organising themselves and are only a few hours after this announcement.
In essence, the Chinese People's Congress allows communist leaders to exclude any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it made us angry," said the legislator, Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong were lied.
And it's clear that we have something to do with the authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress of Li Fei said that to allow a public nomination in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause “chaos”.
Since 1997, when Britain has returned Hong Kong administration to China, Beijing has promised that beginning in 2017 the inhabitants will be able to elect an executive power.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, as Hong Kong allows direct voting, but also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold firm the nomination process of the Committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be permitted.
The decision came after summer months, which recorded some of the largest and most closely followed protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are driven by the Central occupation of love and peace, which the organizers threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing gives them a general voting right.
On Sunday night, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement gathered in front of the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organizers announced that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that the wave of protests would begin in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Centre only as a final step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and no other choice remains.
We must regret to announce that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the deployment of the Centre is inevitable.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement all day long and have strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters on Sunday and have deployed police and barricades.
The rise of unrest is a sign, according to many Hong Kong residents, that it slowly loses control of the city.
The presence of land-based people increases competition in products and services.
There is also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bent on increasing the pressure from Beijing.
Some people are criticizing the central occupation movement and say their demonstrations are threatening the trade - a rescue boat in Hong Kong.
"The protest he is talking about could cause much more economic damage according to how many people are participating and for how long," says politics Regina Ip, who is criticizing the movement for the long term.
We don't want to worry about Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
Also in recent days, the Chinese state media has also come with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong portray as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 participants - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the biggest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
Pre-election agitator?
The league of Jihlava wears the name according to the political movement
Some 1,600 amateur athletes play a small kick in the southern town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is now named jointly for Jihlava League.
The name was named after one movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
In addition, the ten on his candidate is the boss of the small kicked in the Jihlava Jan Marák.
"There was a general crowd where there was no problem with it," said the Dark One.
The situation around the first league of small kicks had already been dealt with by lawyers at the jiglav town hall and had recommended changing the subsidy allocation system.
A small dig won about a million crowns last year on the city's website.
That's hundreds of thousands of dollars this year.
According to the legal opinion, there is no small-scale digging in violation of the law or the magistrate's directives.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for grant and grant allocations," said Radek Tulis, the speaker.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time to express small-scale kickbacks in the elections of one political party, I don't think that's going to happen anymore.
A high-end "big" football has not yet come up with a similar requirement from politicians.
That the ČSSD would have formed a regional section, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't mind.
On the contrary, I would like to be approached by sponsors from a number of companies," said the president of the regional football union Miroslav Vrzeček.
The head of small football of the other party and the movement in the name of the league does not let go
According to the players, the small kicker would deserve this sport in Jihlava with its own six playgrounds, wardrobes and social facilities.
"For example, the playground at the Stopes is not ours, we are there in the rental," Ondřej Lapeš of Starlet Jihlava club warned.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
There, however, it will build, for example, in my opinion, a senseless area for skaters, who are about 50 people in Jihlava," Murak pointed out.
Prime Minister Jihlava Jaroslav Vymašal (ODS) responded that the small dug uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupá, which are owned by the city.
We want to build a playground that has maximum utilization.
We are about to upgrade or build sports centres at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there's been a huge progress in recent years for a little kick," he added.
Other political parties in the league names will not appear according to Jan Marák.
We have limitations.
If any of us in one field join our partnership, we don't put the other in," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said a member of the council committee for sport Karel Voldán.
"However, the voters assess whether Mr. Marak is using the Little Copaña Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - champions can fly a jet
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand for the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service has its own security site.
Servis is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are looking forward to seeing with our VIF (very important frescoer - very important champion) options this year to ensure that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and luxury.
The speaker said that since the services had just started, they had no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students pay an annual fee of £9,000, they expect the service to find its place on the market.
Compared with students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, students today are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, observed: “For most students, such a project is impossible.
Many students this month entering the university have to cope with the financial crisis, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep pace with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists rise up against racism and police behavior after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, he killed a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, an unarmed young man.
Those waiting for a funeral with their hands up are chanting: “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri for shooting an unarmed young man named Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a shift in the White Feminist Internet discussions.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white women prefer sex to race.
With rising tensions in the Middle West, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the whites' reaction is 100% focused on race.
Compared with the reactions of blacks shortly after the shooting of August 9th, personal articles with inscriptions such as “the idea of a white woman over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not only about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
"I think there are not many people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privileges on such a level," she said.
People felt that they had to express themselves to what had happened.
For the crisis we face, it is characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially balanced that they had to warn it.
According to English professor at Ohio State University, Curtis Mitchell has brought Ferguson to the light of the problems that African Americans face every day and are not perceived as "women's questions" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories on Facebook from my partner's life and get 150 characters from people around the world," Mitchell said.
If I write something about the color in my own country being trapped, it's silently deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who dealt with the issue of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no such thing as race and sex dichotomy.
The black women, according to her, could not make luxury a clear distinction between these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Despite the fact that white women today have the question of race and sex in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hathery, a professor of female education and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was almost all cases of whites being raped," Hathery said.
To justify lynching, you needed the cooperation of whites.
According to Hattery's split between whites and blacks came when warriors of electoral law like Susan B. Anthony examined the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks could have electoral rights.
"They decided to bet the cards on women's voting rights and on the right for blacks to focus later," Hathery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to organize themselves against lynching in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell's instigation of white feminists' reaction to the questions that happened in Ferguson - the issue of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to “take hold” the issues that blacks faced for generations.
"It would be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] were to take the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to birth control?" Mitchell carried out.
The second wave of feminists who have made their career a struggle for reproductive law and access to birth control are now discovering what it means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot with a Facebook attack, where they published Rebecca Carroll's column from Guardian, which demanded that white Americans protest more flexibly against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers of society - and views on race, which differ significantly in public opinion surveys - will seek change," Stein wrote.
Although Steinem stands up for intersectoral feminism, which includes questions of race and sex, her comments on the question of race in America are maturing some people.
An American Enterprise Institute expert, Christina Sommers, author of the book "Who Steined Feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young color men, are "a lot more vulnerable than their sisters", but the comments by Stein side Ferguson face criticism that she had previously raised.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a little My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that gets ahead of the interest of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors this year in the Southwest, the issue of reforming immigration laws again arose - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercado, co-president of We Belong Together, a women's organisation for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order for the issue to be presented as necessary to women, the only thing she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercado.
Since most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have been made in women's organizations," she said.
Apartment of pigs in Ipswich for sale
The real office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, it rested on him in the living room of the pig.
A single-bedroom separate house, which is for sale for £120,000, is on a private road in Ipswich.
The information photographs included a picture of the living room in which he rested with his head on the sofa of the pig.
Connells' real office said that the pig on the photograph is the pet owners.
"The photo was accidentally found there, and therefore has already been removed," said the speaker's office.
In real estate information, Connells described a former prayer hall as "a single single single-bedroom house."
Although she has already removed the photo from her website, she still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house aroused interest in social networks where some asked if the press was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
There's a search for new millionaires in the southeast of Perth, and one lucky man takes $1.1 million from a Saturday's lottery ride home.
The Harvey traffic had been at the top of five years for the second time, the last time in November 2009 was one million dollars.
But the lucky winner just has to sign up.
The store owner Steve Forward said the whole town is talking about winning in the southwest of Perth.
It's a major theme and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was on the touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia split one prize last month, culminating in several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a Canning Vale player became one of five August millionaires and just a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for twenty years and said that winnings would allow them to smuggle the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey billionaire is the 59th winner of the West Australia lottery this year, totaling $85 million.
The trains of Deutsche Bahn won't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher wages.
In a press statement, the GDL designated a protest as a warning strike for which it decided to take time outside the traffic peak.
Over time, the GDL takes account of many people who return from weekends on the railway until the first working day.
At the same time, we think of the people who drive for work during the day," the union said on Monday morning in a press release to declare the strike.
"Our first strike should hit mainly freight transport, less passengers," added the GDL.
The DB has not yet published an official response to the strike.
It is not clear how protests will affect international rail links, including the Czech Republic.
Committees require a five percent increase in engine wage and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
At present, the average wage of drivers varies depending on the years worked between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to approach wage growth when working hours are cut.
They stress that the wage assessment of drivers must be developed in the same way as for other railway personnel for whom DB is not counted as a working week.
There was a threat that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he ended up at Barum Rallye.
What exactly happened?
It was a flaw in material.
The car was brand-new, so I didn't think anything like this could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be repaired in a transparent manner and kept at a slower rate in service, where would the mechanics replace it?
If we were going straight there, we would.
But we still had two more ryes waiting, and we couldn't.
It has a high temperature and the risk that the car will start to burn was great.
I can't afford that.
You've been through five speed tests at full speed.
How did you feel about them?
Very good.
I felt young.
We were fast, and I didn't go through the wine.
Everything was caused by the fact that we peed for more than six months to be on some level.
The race has shown that we have succeeded.
You hit him so you could really think about winning.
I made myself and my car so that we really had a win.
Work didn't come up for nothing.
On the other hand, the result that we could have thought of had not come to light.
But this is Barumka.
Unfortunately, the tech said no.
You weren't the only one who got out of the championship fight early.
They're out of it, and they're out of Breen, Abbring, and Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites have resigned?
Yes.
Especially for the audience, it was a shame because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, who you're planning for, was also on the top of the hill for a long time.
But he added that he took off the track and gained almost two minutes of manko.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's too bad he could've retaliated to the winners' degree.
I mean, he was on his first time.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was prepared well.
He went very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular participant in rally races?
Not at this point.
I told you last year Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't keep it.
I've decided I'm going to go again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'm probably going to do it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking me if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumca?
The team continues.
Next week we'll go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn't hurt the car too much.
Plus, for this race, we want to borrow Honza Sýkora's fabii.
With Mirou, we have a European bi-compartment in Switzerland and in Corsica.
We'll have to get things ready for next year.
Is there anything you can suggest?
No, nothing's decided.
When Korská Rally was part of the world championship, the fifth place you reached your maximum in the series.
Isn't it tempting to try that line again?
He's not.
Oral agreement with employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have to issue a medical certificate of disability, which serves as proof to the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer.
After that, there was an agreement that the days would be recorded as vacations, but the agreement was held only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose the obligation to have the employer's consent in writing to take the leave, in practice this procedure has proved successful.
If there's only an oral agreement, you don't have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the taking of leave, as in your case, may be denied and the absence of work may be assessed as a long-term unexplained absence, therefore the reason for the immediate abolition of the employment ratio according to § 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a contract dispute with an employer, you lack proof.
However, the working relationship with you has not been cancelled pursuant to § 53, only you have the days listed in the credit note as an unexplained absence.
The unannounced absence in the credit card does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to collect material security in unemployment), yet it is a difficult option to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit your doctor again and have him confirm in writing that there has actually been an accident resulting in you being unable to work (this is not a so-called "incapacity", it is only a doctor's report).
When looking for a new job, you can present the said document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the publication of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, the early notification to the employer or the request of written consent to the taking of leave.
You're avoiding possible complications.
Tony Stewart's accident when he's back on the track.
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a little bit behind the Atlanta Motor Speedway race track.
Stewart twice ran into the fence after his right front tire broke in 172nd round, and the race for him was over.
Stewart drove the wrecked car into the garage, didn't tell the reporters and left.
The chief of his team, Chad Johnston, said the car team No. 14 is disappointed, but will now focus on the Richmond race, in Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart ran into the game for the first time in a Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch, which demanded repair of the right side of his car.
"We had put our hopes for a good ending in today's race," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at the New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up with the place in the table.
He returned to the race during an investigation of a tragic accident in which he died of a 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into the race.
The authorities said the investigation of the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
A triple champion was looking forward to a warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started at the 12th place, at the beginning of the race he worked on the 10th and then even on the 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd wheel, with Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, drove out of the second corner and hit Stewart, sending both cars to the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to the 21st place.
Prague chooses a new taxi station manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new administration of the taxi service stations.
For 103 parking stations, he gets about 12.3 million crowns a year.
Until recently, at the same locations for taxi drivers, she collected 150,000 crowns a year.
He informed Councilman Lukaš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used lotions to select administrators.
The winner then obtained a flat-rate rent of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
He is currently deciding on the amount of the offer.
"The year after the cancellation of the original leases and the opening of the tender procedure, it has been proved that the new system of rentals is far more advantageous and more fair for Prague," the councilman said.
The most expensive bottle is on Perštín
The highest price was offered by the applicants for a station in Na Perštín Street.
He pays 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by new administrators for seats in front of the General House or the Václav Square.
The new rules for renting taxi duty stations were adopted in autumn 2012 and in the summer of last year the original lease agreements were cancelled.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and the new administrator found 29 sites.
We had to clean the well for the second time this year.
We let her go all the time, which practically created a second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo.
It's an incredible smell!
Our wells in the cellar have always been plenty of wonderful scented water.
And it wasn't done by anyone professionally, my grandfather beat her up with help.
A long time ago.
She was just on three crosses and totally smug, like everything in the cabin, but like I said.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we drained the water.
When she stood there for many months, she deserved it.
But then we thought the water didn't smell anything.
We were wondering if anything had fallen in there.
In the place where the pump was passing, it was possible, in a little bit of bad luck, the board was not quite there, so the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed it was moving.
Otherwise, nothing was seen in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we released her again and re-cleaned her.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a patched package lying on the ground with some dice on it.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a piece further.
Now it looked like a dazzling mouse.
By the ceiling, where there are vents, Grandpa's invention, there were remnants of fish!
And heavy!
Our basement's self-sufficient, too.
Someone would say Grandpa just buried the cabin.
And it wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and floors are only suffocated sand, only the ceiling is submerged.
There's a lot of ships out there.
And the wheels.
And a beach lounger.
The door with wide spaces was usually open, like someone used to go there all the time.
At the ceiling, several of the breaths mentioned above.
Without a net, they usually fly in there and build nests on the beams.
It's useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to blow, and that's it.
But now he didn't even help.
The whole store smelled.
So we cleaned out the entire cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: board, heracolite board, etc.
Our cabin on the far side welcomed the surrounding disinfection stage.
We've been wondering who could have gotten us those nasty leftovers?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here all over.
It's hard for her to come to our place to get a snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite okay.
If Franta didn't blow our airsickness out there?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to watch and check the cellar and well regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, just for washing and washing, before the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water from a forest well is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
One day, we heard a scary anxious barker of our bitch.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long strong black hose next to the porch in the grass.
The cut was jumping over her, and she was smoking like a fool.
Her mom blackmailed her because she thought Réza was digging a garbage hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, though, the hose partially sucked into the club and partially came straight.
There's been a strike on the balcony.
Réza got a hysterical seizure.
We ran down.
She was going to swallow a huge toad, and Réza was defending her.
It was not clear whether she wanted to save the toad or whether she wanted to eat it herself, but it was irrelevant.
When she saw the embossed in the shape of our entire family, she probably thought we should eat it when we were so hungry, and elegantly stretched through the shower into the basement.
We went to see her.
Like lightning jumped over a well.
By the way, we noticed another smelling package on her board.
I think it's fish.
She wasn't there yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a little grey.
And we closed the basement during the day.
I don't know.
We went out there, and we all fell for one breath.
We didn't wait long.
It's stuck behind the well.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the whole treat went off to the well.
She swung around the pump and started getting inside.
The fireman got revenge, bought books for the company and sold them
After his release, the burned employee bought them on a computer company and then sold them.
The money he got was made to spend before the police were arrested.
During a short period of time, a man purchased in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"He took the notes after taking them to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaars," said Chief Commissioner of the Sumperian Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive of the fraud was the revenge of the employer for his release and also for the profit of money.
"At the hearing, he said he used the money to pay off the loans," Brückner said.
Police also found out that a fraud is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated for psychiatric treatment.
Thus, the money could have ended up in winning instruments or in video terminals.
"The fact is, we haven't found any money with him," said the Commissioner.
A fraud who has been punished once for stealing is now at risk of a prison sentence of one to five years.
The police have not yet told us whether the punishment is also threatening to the bazaars that the notebooks purchased and continued to sell.
"It is true that they were taking over brand-new goods, which is at least suspicious," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar has yet been charged.
Come on, just a little bit longer, you can do it, or you can't do it the way I've enjoyed We Run Prague.
This year, the organizers have made some changes for us.
The biggest was a change of route that brought the target to the flood, instead of leading back to the Yellow baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
With the team, we decided to treat our readers personally at the stand, where we took pictures and filmed videos together.
In order to reach perfection on the other hand, I accepted the role of personal guide.
My friend Katya and I just got off the track of 60 to 70 minutes before the launch.
We greeted friends who walked us through the faster runners sector.
There wasn't much time left.
A few jumps to warm up, turn on the athletes, countdown and start!
The screams of the jasotene, but instead of a quick start, followed the clap to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn the measurements on, and move at an hour of ten.
We mix with the yellow snake runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, all of them look fresh, slowly falling suns on the sky provide a view of Vyšehrad almost to the lush breath.
The pulsating mass stretching along the coast looks like all of Prague is running here.
On the beach between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has the strength.
The light hill on Palack Square forces many runners to slow down or move into walking.
Just before crossing to Divadelna, I see a police escort, followed by Věk Pavlícht at an incredible pace in the target.
I hear the admiring suffocation of other runners.
I move to the edge of the line, I encourage him, he's going to cry with me, but right before that, my foot's going to be flattened, and our hands are going down.
Crossing the Theatre Street gives you a chance for a short rest and breathing.
There's a place in front of us where my eyes can breathe.
The turning point on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in the beauty of the falling sun.
I'm not breathing and my legs are almost alone.
The first refreshment comes with a moment of truth.
On the crossing of the road Katya skobrtne about the curb and shows the jump of the swimmer.
See if she needs any help, and I'm launching a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and continues with the Goat Street, it is one of the most comfortable places of the track, although at this stage of the race there is no longer such a rush, yet there is a need to follow the surroundings well.
I don't know yet that the concept of the easiest place gets its true meaning later on.
For the Dust Gate, we are frenethically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to bloat with anyone who offers a hand, and I'm advising Kata too, because 10 clicks with fans is like half a power bar.
It's really working, we're speeding up again, and although we're down pretty badly, now the race has started.
We're passing dozens of runners when I pass someone particularly tired, and I'm trying to encourage him with a few words, "Come on, just a little bit longer, you can do it!"
No one's coming after us for the last refreshment. We're accelerating.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the target will hurt, but it really needs to go down.
The sun has fallen slowly and the day ending is slowly ending the race.
Last trip to the bridge, turn around, and now it's a straight line to the target.
The tempo we're running surprises me, where does this girl come from?
"Come on, we're going under 13. We're on the phone!"
We're trying, we're printing, and there's a target.
Hour thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done?
Coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes to plan.
Which is a great result.
Just as Cata's aim is to break her legs, I help her to the railing where she's resting for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from well - performed performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target area.
Euphoria doesn't let us think of a pushover in the passages to the dressing rooms.
Here it is seen that the Goat Street was not the easiest place.
This is for the purpose of a flood, which is under the pressure of nearly tens of thousands of runners loaded to burst.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not his place.
After a while, I'm losing my head, and I'm wondering if the beautiful views and the last years have been more interesting for what's going on in the target.
I know from my own experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If tens of thousands of people are involved, the rich accompanying program and the closure of the whole Prague centre for all transport is a huge challenge.
This year's change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere immersed in the Yellow baths has passed between runners and in the race itself.
The organizers around the track and random viewers stepped it on every metro line.
Unfortunately, in the urban run, the historic centre must count on obstacles that cannot be removed, but the aim of the mass race in a place that is bordered on the wall and on the other river is not the best solution.
If I tell myself that the race ended with a goal, I'll evaluate it as very successful.
For the purpose, I was a little concerned about the health of the people involved, but in the end everything worked out well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route too and what you say about the situation in the target.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organise protests
Hundreds of prison staff throughout Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest assembly in front of the Ministry of Justice in Sofia's capital.
At the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demand for reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov, also includes higher salaries.
The month overseers symbolically protested against new working hours and demanded a return to their original 20 - hour shifts.
Although the prison wards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) was informed.
"The negotiations are still under way," said BNR Director General of Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
Members of the Federation of Staff Trade Organisations at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of prison staff.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we can't see them.
The physicists don't usually write best sellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University managed to strike black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible route for laymen to penetrate the thicket of problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing with today - trying to unify two excellent, yet mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the causes of the success of the elegant universe is undoubtedly that in finding a unified physical theory it is not a boring story.
The physical underlying problem between two key theories (even now our universe is de facto divided into two different worlds with different laws) has been solved and solves with such ideality that it is worth telling both the laymen and the laymen.
In addition, Greene counseled himself with the complex material so much fresh and seductively that he could not be counted on how interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he made his "mistake" mostly in two other books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Obviously, the author would not object if his book kept faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the elegant universe provides almost everything that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years, there will be something more alive in this area (perhaps because the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), and so it is good to enter Greenem's unviolently open world doors of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
However, it is concrete and totally acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes away from the universe for a moment, as a whole, towards something more ground-based, specifically for a long and thin garden hose to water.
Imagine pulling a hundred-metre garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the entire script from a half-kilometre distance (as on the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance, you will easily record a long horizontal stretch of the hose, but if you do not just tolerate a sharpness, the thickness of the hose is difficult to distinguish.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can pass: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given time, you will only answer him with one information: the distance of the ant from the left (or the right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from a distance of half a kilometer, it looks like a long piece of hose as a single-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has thickness.
If we increase everything, we'll suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle opening a hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is obvious that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension after the hose length, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of movement of the clock handles", that is, around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You're starting to understand that you have to enter two numbers to determine the position of the little ant: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle opening the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (later the experts will see that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory string.
Non-domestic aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference marked with a circular arrow is short and lead.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the bending circuit of the hose is short, "swine" and worse known.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a much better resolution.
This example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they're split into two groups.
They can be either large, vast, and therefore directly discernible, or on the contrary small, porky and much worse observable.
Of course, in that case, we didn't just jump in to reveal the "swine" dimension of the opening of the hose thickness.
All you had to do was take a telescope to help.
But if the hose was thinner - like the hair or the capillar - we would reveal the pig dimension only with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he wrote with a stunning idea that space geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
Its radical assertion was justified by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be wrapped into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question is immediately being asked how this Kaluz's observation goes together with the obvious fact that we see exactly three dimensions of space.
The answer Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which he made clear and specified to Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and messy dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the direction of the hose length, our universe has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, whose existence we realize at every moment.
But analogously with a circular garden hose, the universe can also have an additional dimension, firmly coiled into the space so small that even our most perfect experimental apparatus remains hidden.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz' remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine that we draw a relatively dense series of circles in the black color of the hose.
The hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope now, thanks to the drawing, we're going to reveal the pig dimension even harder, because we're going to see the motive in Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, which is a four-dimensional dimension.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
In order to help our imagination, let us note the illustration of Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space as we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each of the following levels represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have an additional dimension (we see them at the fourth level of enlargement) if the shits are small enough; we explain that we have not noticed them directly so far.
The square grid depicts the commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle represents a new, tiny and twisted dimension.
Just as chains of threads in densely woven carpets, even these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - only because of their opinions we have placed them only in intersections in the square grid.
The background of picture 4 illustrates the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such normal scales as the meters, marked by the side of a small square in the square grid.
On each of the following pictures, we focus on a small area of the previous picture, increasing it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at a few first levels of enlargement.
But if we follow the microscopic properties of the geometry of the space further - at the fourth level of the magnification in Figure 3 - we see suddenly new, in the shape of a circle with a curved dimension, similar to the loops, or in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists at each place in the direction of the large dimensions in a similar way as the hose has a circular circumference at each point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we covered the circular dimension only in some of the regularly placed points.
Figure 4 Kaluzov and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of the space summarizes.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also record important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-off spatial dimensions (from which only two are drawn), while the hose has only one size.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular lead dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as the circular circuit of the hose - much harder than seeing the apparent, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact reveal it over the strengths of our most modern zooming tools.
Most importantly, the additional dimension is not just a round dome inside the normal dimensions, as a two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
The circle dimension is the new dimension that exists at each point of the three normal wide dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions as independent as are the dimensions of the top-downs, left-to-right and from the front-to-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A fairly small ant could move in all four dimensions and we would need four data to determine its position, except for the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if we count also time, then data five, in any case one more than we normally expected.

The price for e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that, knowing that there are only three dimensions of space, shows Kaluzovo and Klein thinking that this does not preclude the existence of additional pig dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have as many dimensions as we can see with a mere eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can identify structures of a large billion-billion-foot structure.
We can barely observe the smaller pig dimensions.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kaluz idea with several ideas of just born quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggest that the additional circular dimension could have about one Planck's length, that is, the size far beyond the distinguishing ability of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small space dimensions of Kaluzow-Klein theory.
Swim Honza Homola advises how to exercise on the electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of "twelves" consists of a twelve-titical harmonic form that you can always repeat.
Anyone who stares at music theory will find its principle detailed here.
Jan Homol or Honz Homolka Tablet (1976)
By educating the archduke and the archduke whose facebook profile can be monitored here, he has been living as a graphics since his graduation 20 years ago.
She's a guitarist band named Wohah, which is unfortunately impossible to walk away from.
The guitarist is after his father, just like Matthew's brother, leader of the Woghites.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is on you alone, you can think of anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve," advises Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen to and watch Honza, which can be done with twelve harmony on two strings and how well it's starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already play some songs with the melody.
When you finally add a fourth, watch out for a change of tune, alerts Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza comes back to pentatonics and you try to get it together with a 12-year-old.
So practice it honestly.
Best of all, you'll be able to read that in an interview with Jane Homola at the first lesson in his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, recognises the Hradec Dvorak.
We're taking the point and we're happy for him.
The first half of the time we had more chances of us, the second home," said the attacker, who this time scored from the penalty kick.
You weren't nervous when he played, were you just accompanied by a giant sandbag?
I didn't see it in particular, although for the second goal, where there are domestic fans, it would probably be worse.
You've settled the penalta half an hour, but you've also scored a goal from the penalta for less than four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, it came from the corner, and then the penalta.
After that you got up and the first half you were a better team who had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree with the fact that after the scored goal, we played well until the break.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game after her, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
It is also true, though, that the locals said something about the breakup of their game, perhaps not very happy with it.
You only fought for the first time on the field, while at home you may not have scored a goal.
Why is it so different?
I don't think it's such a difference. It's more of a matter of how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Plzeň, that's another category.
Four games you were waiting for the goal, weren't you afraid that after the last game it might be similar?
Not at all, but of course we're glad that we don't have to talk about waiting for a goal since last game.
Now we've added another one without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which is not for the big celebration yet.
Island - lava flows from a mile away crater.
A lava flying to the surface in the area of Holuhraun near the Vatnayökull glacier, flows through the underground tunnel from a mile away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now the scientists are most concerned...
The situation remains constant for now.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still leaves the pukliny about the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruptions of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
Scientists, however, fear that the lava tunnel could also be opened in areas under the ice.
If that were the case, in addition to the similar intensity of the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökulsá a Fjollum river and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption it is to feel a strong smell of sulphur, from the cracks rise clouds of steam and gas.
This is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case in Fimmvörðuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is also much more gas," says Vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, and in the early hours it was near windless.
The trails of the sandstorm were swept away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange degree (second highest) for Bárðarbung and the yellow (third) for Askja applies.
Heaven over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She went through her wings.
Flight day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, the flight acrobat Peggy Valentine introduced herself, who in the flight came out of the cockpit to the castle on the upper wing of the two-dimensional wing and also between the wings.
It's only for muscle strength.
The flight day in Cheb took place this year in the fifth and the organizers managed to prepare several interesting flight pieces again.
The premiere was not only "walking on wings" at the oldest Czech airport in the German acrobat Peggy Valentine, but also the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his glowing treble.
An acrobatic called Wingwalking has its origins in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried so hard.
But because of a large number of fatal injuries, he was banned.
Today, however, he slowly returns to the air days program.
Peggy comes out of the cockpit on her upper wing after the launch.
That's where he shows different drills.
At the end of the performance he will move to the space between the wings of the plane, where her show continues," described Luděk Matějíček from the Cheeb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air date.
The plane pilot Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy’s performance was the main foal of the program, then the following performance of the fighter Mustang was a famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter has reached the area with the Grippenes of the Czech Republic Army in a curtain (so-called numbers).
Such an assembly could be seen for the first time by air fans in the Czech Republic.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone a breathtaking acrobation with a 1945 aircraft.
The product was still in the war, but he probably never took part in it.
He was assigned to the military reserve.
Since 1963 he has worked in the civil sphere.
Even as a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at Munich Hradiště airport.
In the same place is also another pearl of the Chebian air day, two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditioner.
At the airport, a powerful machine didn't go missing.
Its polished aluminium treble flashed into the distance.
The admirer also acquired Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French air force.
A small transport plane surprised the rejected Turbolet and from the German Hofu brought part of the German delegation to the air day.
The German neighbors showed up in Cheb with reconstructed planes Like 18T or three-part formations of Bücker Jungmann's two-pieces.
Lucie Borgy: A dramatic comeback to the camera!
At least for tonight, Lucie Borgy replaced her parents' care for the work.
Stress or nervousness - blonde moderator obviously doesn't know any of it.
Because she was doing well on TV, as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since blondes ended their six-weeks, where women experience the greatest stress after childbirth.
However, Lucie will not show up regularly in the main news channel TV Nova.
A regulatory return is expected according to information Flash.cz in a month.
It's just Linda's daughter needs her now more than a TV audience.
Lucie Borgy went back to the TV screen and it hit black.
A hand-to-hand exhibition in Prague?
The hall would be sold out, planning the Jag's bachelor party
It would be worthy of such a thing during the world's championship.
But it matters how the union stands," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Match, in which an impressive Nagan team met again.
And the players who participated in the gold Hattrick.
Players would have a taste, wouldn't they?
Sure.
It would be good to say good-bye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think it's possible to find one or two days during the tournament, when it's completely free and where it could be placed.
We will tell Gum (Jiri Šlégrev) or Bede Šerban (the leader of the jighead fight) who would take care of it...
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you play with New Jersey play-off?
Well, if I'm gonna fly in like that...
But you don't want to play in the team.
Or has the jighead meeting changed your mind?
Representations and exhibition games are two different things and there are decisive performances in the representation.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performances are decisive, especially at the world championship.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you actually enjoy that Nagano meeting?
Just meeting the players was great.
You've brought back stories and you've had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans but also for us hockey players.
Of course, the most important thing was respect for Ivan Hlinka.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that there's been a generation that's really worth it.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmanek on the alternator.
Will you still have your first representation match?
You don't forget that kind of thing.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we performed in one three.
For all of us, it was the first launch.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, you can't say that.
In Jihlava, after a long time, Dominique Hasek was caught.
What did you say to his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with this criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagra for why he decided to end up in the representation).
And the Fist has done a great job.
And he was with me once a night of training and there was a hole.
And now he's caught up with the fanciful.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the footballers are getting qualified.
Prominent guests attended the NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could see the goalkeeper Peter Chech of Chelsea, the representative coach Paul Vrb...
And over there, the character in the black cap, that's Tomáš Russian!
The publisher of Arsenal and the captain of the team arrived at a meeting of about half twelve among the last.
We've got a great game to fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said, when he had already presented himself to the press at the assembly.
Czech representation programme
Monday 1st September: start of strike, first training
Tuesday September 2nd: Training opened for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiad (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letna)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of collision
The Russian and gender fans can support before the midterm match against the US (20:15).
The presentation opened Tuesday’s training for them, starting at 6:30 p.m.
And it will be followed by an autograph, which will not be missed by Russian or Czech.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be more peaceful.
Which commends Coach Vrba, who was complaining about the amount of social events he had in the spring.
Finally, we will do what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been for so long," he praised Vrba, who has officially been leading the national team since January.
The Czech football representation will be accompanied by a musket image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
He's got three matches under the Vrbo, all ready.
With Norway and Finland, she resuscitated 2:2 and lost 1:2 with Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
Not until now.
The fight with the Netherlands will launch a qualification for Europe 2016.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could handle the U.S. General.
The first half was for us to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We must think of being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player of the 30-member nomination that has health problems is the attacker David Lafat.
He's got a fever.
If he didn't make it to the U.S. Wednesday game, Coach Vrba would call another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
A British woman describes how after a bad diagnosis she thought she was going to die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was about Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spine.
The charity organisation CMT UK stated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
In the United Kingdom, it is believed that CMT is suffering from some 23,000 people, which can show symptoms in motorbike such as muscle weakness, motionless walking and twisted fingers.
Infected people may also experience numbness or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from a Freidreich attack (FA) - a disease that had a very bad forecast.
She believed that before she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be tied to a wheelchair, and dead before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child I knew I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day and everything took longer.
I could never ride a skateboard with the other kids, or skateboard, and I was bullied at school for walking and running."
When Rodgers was thirteen and after several surgeries that were to release her Achilles' treads and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room and looked into her documentation where she learned that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked for information about the disease in the library and I wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When they answered, I was in shock, and I totally panicked.
I thought that before I was 18, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and before I was twenty-five, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my powers.
I was on my own, and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her walking ability had not worsened as much as she expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He stood up, hugged her, and said: “Honey, I don’t think you have the disease, otherwise you would be in a wheelchair.
I think it's going to be something far less dangerous."
After performing several genetic tests, it was found that it had CMT.
"When he explained what CMT was, I thought I was a happy child," she said.
The charity CMT UK launched a month of information about CMT to alert this disease.
Businesses in Washington: economic turnover increases taxes
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxes by companies in the country accelerated economic recovery last year slightly increased and companies in Washington were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia combined for fiscal year 2013 to the state and local treasury funds amounted to $27.6 billion, an increase of 3.8% over the $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
The tax burden - state and local - went up by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and it was the third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were reduced.
According to a study carried out by Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, government taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than local deductions, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is from trade tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows the relatively low tax revenue from the company.
Researchers argue that the majority of the growth in tax revenue stems from an increase in the value of property belonging to companies, which this year, after three consecutive years, increased by -1%.
Although most of the profits come from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the same situation seems to be true in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion last year for government and local property taxes, representing an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of the properties does not so much evasive of public and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the tax on real estate represents less than a fifth of the tax on companies.
For companies in Virginia and D.C. it represents a property tax of almost half of the state and local taxes.
“A lot of property in Maryland is owned by companies, especially the base of taxes around D.C., a government or non-profit organization that does not pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
Recent increases in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed only to a healing market for real estate.
According to the data, business revenue also appears to be increasing.
Companies in this region have published a tax on commercial companies $2.3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland's tax on corporate incomes has picked one billion dollars, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, local corporate tax burdens do not grow in these three places as quickly as possible.
The growth rate in D.C. was 4.3% at national average, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was an average tax increase of 4.1 %.
Of the three circuits (of which all have the same tax), Virginia has the lowest corporate tax rate of 6 %.
The rate of taxation of commercial companies in Maryland is 8,25 %, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, to 9,975 %.
A similar study conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has lower national and local taxes and a generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the tax on commercial companies from 6,9 % to 6 %, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the State continues to meet the revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory rate of taxation of revenue could be reduced to 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are better managed and therefore higher public and local taxes are paid.
Business tax paid by small entrepreneurs as a personal income tax - the compensation structure of cost increases by increasing prices, according to which most companies - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia - increased by 20 % last year to $2.4 billion much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and national increase in trade taxes are likely to continue next year, the total sales tax for both state and local governments will be increased to 6,2 % over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may be behind others because the reduction of state spending is taking its toll on the labour market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafat's scissors
Will a new state arise in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorusk
Russian President Vladimír Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government units have been competing with the pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European companies that, following the current anti-Russian sanctions regime, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support given to the West by the warring of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is, according to him, defying democratic values.
The end of the conflict, he said, depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic has claimed the right to disagree with part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is scheduled to propose a form of further confirmation of the anti-Russian sanctions, decided at night for the EU summit.
Journalists were told by the permanent chairman of the meetings of the Member States, Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for moving the forms of sanctions are to be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU "president".
Van Rompuy replaces December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Union summit at the head of the European Council, the so-called EU President, who manages the top meetings of the Member States.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
In the lead of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton is replaced by the Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian, thus becoming Vice-President of the future European Commission, must be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is reality in the Czech Republic, just not talked about

There's a CIA manuscript on it, they needed a war, writes Huml about the MH17 flight shooting down.
The MEP for ČSSD Stanislav Huml has a clear idea of who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the hard sanctions imposed on the shooting of a civilian aircraft with almost 300 dead have deliberately caused the Ukrainian army".
According to the legislator, it's an additional knowledge of the CIA manuscript.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are coming up and the parties are offering the impossible again
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and a trailer above Prague.
This is repeated before any election: the parties promise the impossible.
Also now with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are ahead of who will be more interested in voters.
Lidovka Server.cz chose unfulfilled promises from the present and the past.

A Disturbing Seat Begins
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Her commander, Alois Liška, has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side finally complied, and this ground unit was designated as one of its forces during the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.

Joan Rivers family: "We're holding fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has expressed herself today that she is not losing the hope that a 80-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to a rescue service, according to which she had had a heart attack on the York endoscopy in Upper East Side, as indicated by the source.
Doctors deliberately maintain it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of its condition, which remains “serious”.
The reactions did not allow them to wait long, including unreal internet support from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is twisted headlines
That the media is twisting reality with their headlines, there is (although) no news.
I know the headlines "sell" the paper, but unfortunately, I also know that many so-called "readers" are reading nothing else.
And that's the fact that I've been very troubled lately, that's more of a word of displeasing.
This concerns in particular articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel Attacked Gaza" are quite common.
You will only read in the text that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the cease-fire.
That's what the headline "Both Party Breaks the Armistice" comes up.
Does the journalist realize that he is directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not just there)?
Not even 60 years have passed since the end of World War II.
There are still people who survived Shaw.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans of "Jewish swine" and similar misdemeanours, I was struck.
Does the world want to finish what didn't happen to Hitler?
Do our journalists realize the fact that the Jews were destined for the liquidation of the Slavanov?
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as "watchdogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of a truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation would be ousted and the Czech Republic would be wiped out of the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also realize one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Israeli Arabs live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're fine.
If you ask them, why don't they go to Gaza, like, answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security and top health care (I myself have seen the top private hospital of Hadassa, which is financed by the sponsorship gifts of Jews from all over the world, the Arabs, and they are treated there, of course).
Hamas also attacks his Arab brothers with his arrows.
The only real aid to Gaza, including this restless area, is to rid Hamas of it and disarm it.
And judge not Israel, that it should not be in titles.
Inform Hamas of his practices, of his abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas is intended to eliminate the State of Israel, at any cost.
Even at the cost of killing innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organizations.
Please inform us that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which, however, Gaza administrators do not pay and even become angry that the supply of electricity is sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas did not invest money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could penetrate suicide bombers into Israel's territory, but perhaps into building housing houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMASON just confirmed the allegations of Monday morning Information: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys $1.04 billion (970 million) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement was surprising, not because no one expected Twitch to buy, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, Twitche Googlu’s sales appeared to be one billion - sure, and this connection looked natural.
Twitch, who only three years ago founded Justin.tv, had set up to become a widely used video streaming service - live YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online transmissions from games - the words Business Insider “YouTube for live playing”.
Twitche Interface.
On YouTube there are already popular videos “Let's play”, a species where wisers (most of the older) play the game processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes up with a lot on Twitch's description, so news that YouTube buys Twitch, nobody gets excited, it's a textbook example of how the company that is established pays off possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn't work, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the statement by CEO Twitche Emmet Shear: “We chose Amazon because we believe in our society, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us fulfill it more quickly.”
Another mystery is - frankly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim that sports do better than watching, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about games instead of real playing just to observe.
One thing is to watch a friend over his shoulder at three in the morning, as President Evil plays, and a whole other thing is to watch a stranger get 20 shots into his head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are from a player's perspective, so to look at their record without you being able to control your perspective, is a pretty good recipe for getting yourself sick.
I admit that the games of speed run, in which Roger Bannisters of our electronic time complete the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone is not master of acting or humor, his channel on Twitchi will probably not be very interesting.
But what about the sceptic like I do?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth on top of Internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to use this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch blends into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it would have been to swallow YouTube.
But Twitch has something she would like to attract every company: the hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As the director of Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, "believe in the future of games" and the media do not seem to give up, nor do they appear to be watching.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheist @logger Aaron Ra.
This time on the subject "Holy Letters are God's word."
Original video supplied.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by the gods and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that conflict with their religion, they often ask us: Whom will you trust?
The supposed word of God or the word of man?
It's like human research is completely insignificant compared to the authority they imagine to have their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths of God written by men.
If there really is an intelligent with a creator for some purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and it must be he who added a series of other evidence that only points to the evolutionary conclusion in the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't make any of these things.
But people can tell stories, pacify.
And they were people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be God's word.
Each supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as being written down by men, not by gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or maybe listened to the dictatorship of angels, but those texts were not written by anyone other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not by angels and no longer by gods.
If there really was one true God, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergénius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, a single scripture.
She would be known anywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not blindly believe her, because she would be consistent, supported by verifiable and truthful evidence, and would display deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would require the inspiration of each reader for the unity of faith.
If God wrote her, we wouldn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart into more and more separate denominations, searching for contentious truths, and each one somehow seeks God’s guidance, regardless of continuing diversity and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Koran, the Bahá'u'llah of Kitab-i-Akdas, the Zarathustrov Avest, the Sikh Adí-Granth, the Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Urantia book are all considered "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true god" and the respective believers of each of them say that the others are astray.
The only logical explanation is that everyone is in a certain way astray.
None of the above - mentioned books have any advantage over others.
Neither of them has any evidence and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historical.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apology, because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be claimed that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote hateful superstitions instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - each of which may also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
The leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and thus are subject to interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often prejudices of politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it an argument, rather a commentary.
We must again point out that there are two different authors whose work has somehow been mixed together during some editorial review.
She's right that Genesis has more than one author and is definitely not a witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, namely the five books of "Moses" and Moses do not write down any of them because they almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents have been refiltered in the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by the doctrines and epionites and their completely different views of Jesus, who eventually combined themselves in some compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, as Luciferians, were dispersed and discredited by other revisions of the Bible.
One of these administrations relates to King Ugarita, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers were a major threat to the youth of the Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, "Son of the Mountain" changed to Belzebub "Son of the Mush".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what became the New Law was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of committee decisions at the Nicaea Chamber.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by simple uplifting of their hand as if the reality of a matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depends on what was read about Sundays in Christian centers back then.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about in the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel accounts.
And so the nucleus of the canon evolved out of the original church's ear like this.
So the council simply accepted as the gospel of any relevant stories that were hanging among the uneducated masses at that time.
Yet, they were also aware of the fact that more than ten books of the Bible were taken from the Bible, even though they were referred to by the books that were approved.
Among the rejected items, we will find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s word refer us to books that are just words of some people and/or are not even available anymore?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could God be approved in this way if he was the true author of this random mix of reputations, resemblances, and lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not too enlightening, rather the opposite!
That's the reason why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whether it's almost anything from beginning to end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believe in enchantments, blood victims, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and five living magic.
They thought if they used a magic rod that they spray with blood, it would cure him from the leper.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and pips were a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed the pregnant cow the striped patterns, she would give birth to the striped calves.
How could anyone say that who knows anything about genetics?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible had been written down by a higher being, it would not have contained the mistakes it contained.
If she had come from a pen of truly superior beings and was meant to be literal history, then she would have contained nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings have been written down by uneducated and bizarre savages who have ignored or promoted cruelty against animals, incest, slavery, exploitation of slaves, abuse of family members, child abuse, abuse of children, abortion, imprisonment, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they were doing God's will.
But creationists are still ignoring all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
Why?
Because if the creatives didn't have their love books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, the same thing.
It's ironic that they reject God's "act" as "reverent creation instead of creation."
But they consider the word of man to be the word of God, and the God of themselves, and even insist that the turning away of their supposedly "holy" books is somehow a turning-off god as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creative Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and that the Bible could be wrong at the same time because he cannot separate doctrine from deity.
So it's a kind of prayer where believers worship a man made compilation, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are JEHOVAH's word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposed "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified and often deliberately altered and twisted by mere erring people.

Attacker in Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of them died.
A man named Chenn, according to New China Agency, forced entry into the elementary school building in the morning and attacked about half of the 11th local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chen later killed himself with a leap from the height, introduced New China with a reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection for children in a country where many couples have only one offspring in line with government policy.

Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started a school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
One hundred and fifteen thousand champions joined the first class this year.
Over 850,000 children will attend primary school and over 405,000 students will be educated in high school, estimated by the Ministry of Education.
The new article The news director of Nova's report is David Fiala
Since 1 September, David Fiala has become the new director of news and news media.
He will replace Alan Zaruba, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova group since 1 June.
David Fiala had previously served in the Z1 News Division.
For the past two years, under the leadership of Alan Zaruba, he has been involved in the realization of a complete visual change of news coverage TV news, Střepiny, Prásk! and other publicist TV shows Nova.
David Fiala manages very well the synergy of communication between editorial, study management and graphic department, which is the essence of the work of the news director.
It has a feeling for typography and pure elegant design, which is the way we want to keep taking on the newsroom of Nova," says the creative director of Nova Alan Zaruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, got naked pictures of celebrity to the public
Image of screen listing of missing files
So far, an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, alerted the American server Mashable.com.
It is reportedly acquired by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where disabled users recorded them by automatically backuping images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't spoken to the problem yet.
Part of the celebrity rejects images as fake, but several of the images concerned have already admitted their authenticity.
Among them is the actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for her title role Katniss in the movie series Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, which played for example in the Deathtrap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the captured images and videos to enrich.
The footage was reportedly shown interest in American journals, according to reports on server 4chan but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it is very likely really about weakness in iCloud security.
A tool appeared on the GitHub server two days ago that enabled you to get passwords to user accounts through rough force, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool worked well, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is clear that potential attackers had plenty of time to access different accounts before this instrument was published.
iCloud users should therefore change their password associated with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The escape of naked images of celebrities is considered to be a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers are companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, secure multiple times better than computers in households or smaller companies, upload sensitive photos in unprotected forms is a unnecessary risk.
If you want to backup explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt files before upload.
It is also wise to set up automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it only takes place on wi-fi and after connection to the charger.
So you will be able to move "to security" in time sensitive images, and you will be able to delete untraceable images, so they will not waste space in the online repository.

A smart way to save for a college script.
Given that the prize for the college script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, an upcoming student of the second year came in with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a system for lending books to high school students with the offer of nominal compensation to keep them from being sold back.
"A book for calculations that normally costs $180, I won for a semester for ten and for chicken nuns," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He lost 120.
According to the University Council, an average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and textbooks, but students have different options as to how to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes internet shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise there is lending of textbooks, allowing students to use the semester book, often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Or Inc operating more than 250 bookshops in campuses says the lending of books has doubled since 2011.
The research in the section shows that about a quarter of the books in the university bookstores were in the last spring semester borrowed, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are bought by the National Association of University Trades in University Bookshops.
Here's 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books may be less than a third on the Internet than in the university bookshop.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book “Calculus” by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to purchase a new $239.99 on Chegg.com in a small shop specialized in textbooks.
Purchase used
If you do not mind the comments of other people or the wear and tear, the appropriate options are the text used.
At Chegg.com, Calculus is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a college student at Brigham Young University, says that he paid the Amazon.com for the used print “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” 42 cents.
The new one sold for $48.
University Teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College With Walls, suggests that students at their students check whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes to work in seminars are not essential.
If so, the older edition may be sold at a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a popular alternative to buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Borrowing
The textbooks are also worth considering, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them and you do not need them even after the seminar is over.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, the student could borrow Calculus for the entire semester for about 20 dollars.
Meet the terms of business in which you borrow a book, including the penalty for notes, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to obtain a normal e-book instead of a normal e-book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for some time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows Calculus for six months for approximately $61.
According to Bracey, the best offers can be found by literary students because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go shopping.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon join Pepperdine Law School, recommends to follow ISBN, because it guarantees that you buy the right book.
Before ordering a book over the Internet, make sure it's really a warehouse, advises Gault.
He found out about it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay a full price for a book from the university bookstore.
The mud, the mud.
And then in the well, they found a tortoise rifle from the end of the war.
The well is a little off St. George's Church.
We discovered a growing area around us, and we started pulling out a summer load of about a foot and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the bare bottom, we hit the top," treated Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found out it was a tortoise of attack German rifles used by SS units.
It's supposed to be unusual to find.
According to my information, these rifles were made until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand," Novak added.
All wooden constructions have been broken down over time, so it is useless.
Her body, however, is preserved - she keeps her shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There's one explanation.
Maybe it was dumped by people who needed to get rid of weapons used by SS units, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
Fascists on the run would probably not do that.
They dropped guns in the woods," they thought.
The gun was the only thing the enthusiasts from the Ghost of Jeseniky found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, those once around a lot of them, so we slowed down the excavations, we carefully rewinded the mud, so that there wouldn't be any bad luck, but there wasn't anything else down there," Novák approached.
Find ends up in the museum depository at the castle in the nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
Exclusive interview Current.cz with General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of pro-Russian separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take this... they're calling me from Donetsk," he apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Current.cz Ukrainian Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, or otherwise the director of that Centre for the Liberation of Prisoners of War.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in a TV debate.
At each such interruption, it was not possible to not hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban specifies with his residence at the other end of the phone.
"This will be it--go there," concluded one of the flash discussions with Donetsk and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in reserve, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests in Majdan.
Yesterday, when we had an interview, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to forty-four hours a day.
At present.cz: Perhaps you know that Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counter-intelligence estimates their number to thirty.
There can be many more.
Have you met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated already captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swedish, Georgians... but not yet Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captured countryman and can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What advice do you give to the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers take them?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian flags of volunteers and separatists take them in, they will be shot dead after questioning without mercy, as would any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men to be mercenary soldiers, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take over a group of Donetsk separatists - and thus among them even the Czechs - they sit behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side also acts as a state in the war.
A.H.: And how many have you managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand, in exchange.
Some sources say it's already crossed hundreds of men.
Long ago we stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we freed them... we didn't save them from the war if they decided to continue the fight.
The rescuers are doctors in the war, surgeons, but we certainly don't.
That's it.
And there are more and more coming every day.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be about the exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release prisoners, and it's just a human request.
A.cz: It is heard that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust in the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both warring parties?
That's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev named me "The Crazy General with Steel Balls".
It doesn't offend me.
And it may also suggest the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Police Corps, I've gained some authority before.
I never know, cheat, and keep my word.
Whatever's going on, I'm acting honestly and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it's a Ukrainian government, or the dowry or the Luhans are very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're tortured and killed.
And they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even in the exchange of prisoners, and I've been captured... and this job can be my end at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.H.: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know?
... (long silence) ...the Ukrainians and the separatists are fleeing to torture prisoners during interrogations.
I'm sorry.
And executions?
These only happen on the donor side.
I have no information about the fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
No sign of a Ukrainian army being allowed to do anything like that.
We have an idea about the number of executions, but I can't give the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characteristics and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying to be independent, and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that's what they say.
They don't want to play games anymore with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their irresistible opponents - to life and to death.
As we say, they went through their throats.
The same dreams and the same desires people made on Maydan, by the way.
And now I'm speculating a little: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be great and the other to be small.
This is my sentence, but it's got an irresistible contradiction in it.
A.cz: How do you find one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the lines of the war front, I'm unarmed and I show soldiers or armed men their bare arms.
And they always have me on both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters on a fly or in an optical marker.
The faces of the people who point at me, I see good every time... and they can pull the trigger of their weapons at any time.
Captain, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - the mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a little gubernie in a big Russian empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and Ukraine considers it to be some misunderstanding.
Such a state would not even exist in his view.
At the same time, he is an irresistible enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the discussion show of Ukrainian television, you have named your Prime Minister of Arsenija Jaceňuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do the best if he left quickly.
For those three hundred yards of walking, I'm always scared at least five times.
Why, then, should I hide my view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is hurting our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
Perhaps you know that the Ukrainians of Jaceňek refer to the Queen.
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal from which fear would come, or with other respects and authority.
His behavior is a copy of the rabbit's behavior.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister, he has no right in the war to cry in Parliament, to beg him, to play with his intrigues, to threaten to position a function... he must drive, manage and protect the country during the war.
In the face of a threat to the country, the Prime Minister has no right to family, friends, rest on paid emotions.
He's the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Jaceňuk?
She's like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything all the time.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy could not save the market
3 Sylvester Stallone's survivors returned less than $30 million from the $90 million budget in the US and Sin City: a woman for whom I would kill only $12 million from my 70 million budget.
The Sex Tape movie with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million on the first weekend, as well as movies for children like How to train dragon 2 were a disappointment for cinemas.
According to an article in the film critic Robbie Collin in Telegraph, the quality of children's films is their own fault.
Colin marked 2014 as the "best" year of children's films and how to train dragon 2 called just "functional" continuing.
When it comes to films set on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers with their average summer movie premieres in at least 2,000 cinemas between War Sacrifice Day and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results taken into account by viewers and film critics indicate that this year's film production is similar to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, changes in audience access and greater popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be at fault.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney processing of the Jungle Book, the Hollywood Reporter reported: "I think times are changing."
We have to accept it and not try to pursue what's already been.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood cash dealers, Netflix's profits from online services amounted to $1.2 billion, almost twice as much to $837 million last year.
Last summer, he criticized director Steven Spielberg for relying too much on comic books rights and for predicting a "crash" in Hollywood.
In the light of the current collapse, some commentators state that there may be something at his catastrophic branch.
With the introduction of possible large cash dealers in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimň and Jurska world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
A producer of X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked the decline in the market for simply "cyklicky". For Hollywood Reporter said: "The next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash dealers in history and no one will worry about selling."
The ClDR is threatening Soul again, firing another short-range missile.
North Korea launched another short-range missile into the sea, reported Soul.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of the United States and South Korea's joint military manoeuvres, which Phjongjang perceives as an invasion preparation.
The province of Changang lies in the northwest of KDLR at the border with China.
The South Korean Ministry of Defence, according to the DPA, said that the shots were fired from the northwestern site of the KLDR and reached a distance of approximately 200 kilometres.
So North Korea probably first set off a rocket from the province of Changang, said South Korean media with a reference to military circles.
It is said that the underground launch ramp for Scud rockets is located in the province.
This is another in a series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has done an unusually large number of rocket and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: The first protests in Newport and Cardiff
The protestors of the NATO summit in Newport took place during the weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in the march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough monitored the situation during the weekend and spoke to protestors who had travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from Blue Mountains.
Two youth tourists were picked up by plane and transferred to safety after spending the night at Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16 - year - old girl and 18 - year - old man went on a Sunday noon tour to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
When they didn't come home, relatives called the police around 8:00 p.m.
A patrol company was sent, including a local police force and a rescue team, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 o'clock in the evening.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, they were transferred to Blue Mountain Hospital by ambulance.
Olomouc only brought a point from Opava, the winner had on the leg of yours
A 23-year-old forvard could decide, but he failed in two of the biggest chances.
The goal was mainly to call a shot about three minutes before the end, but she ended up at the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Květon.
I've had it on my feet, I've got to give it a shot.
I'm mad at myself," your ashes fell on his head.
"I should've put it higher under the lid, it's kind of gone down," he said.
Defensive Sigma didn't allow Opava much, except for Mikul's 11th minute raid, which covered the Reich.
Then they started pushing the Hanaks, but they were not running in a block of defensive domestics, and they grabbed the shots from far away, in May.
We've been comparing for 15 minutes, then we've taken the initiative.
In the second half, we were better, we had more of the game, and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the chance your boy didn't change, and so it ended 0-0," the dream of Coach Hanak-Study Leoš Kalvod.
Opava point was also taken because of the absences in the composition, where, in addition to the two injured, Peter Vavřík was missing with the three-headed shooter Peter Ševčík, who hosted Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike its former policy, it did not allow them to enter.
Substitutes deserve discharge.
Sigma acted more football-like, but we didn't let her into anything on one standard," said coach of the Slejzans Petr Baránek.
There's been a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and fighting.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma has reached four points, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that would satisfy the head of the club, Josef Lebra, who after defeating Znojm, made his million-dollar deposit in the treasury of diametrically different performances in the next match.
"We were aware of Mr. Lebra's warning, so there can't be any talk of the boys not wanting to fight," he noticed Kalvod and the address of the sleeping shooter, "I believe it's coming and when he gives the goal, it'll start to fall there.
But after the first shot, I will switch it immediately to save my goals for the next match," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino's twice overtaken Venice.
The film festival is otherwise in crisis
After great enthusiasm for the starting film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iñárritu was among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days showed the impression that interest in the 71st year of the festival in Venice had dropped somewhat.
Whether because the number of places in the largest hall has increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by the criticisms of the recognized, but for viewers the less attractive images as a document on genocide in Indonesia for the 60s.
Comic books heroes
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been laid down by crowds such as in the past and has allegedly ceased to be a problem to find a place in the hotel for the last minute.
There is more talk of the crisis in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that there has been an attack on even as well-respected institutions such as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest a lack of personality, but is present solely in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield's comic superhero representatives, who successfully attended the dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event was the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino for all generations.
Plus, he was in two movies right now.
In the story of Transparency introduced outside the competition, which was filmed by Oscar Barry Lewison according to the novel Philip Roth, the 40-year-old Pacino plays a role that is close to him: an actor at the top of the fame who suffers from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the very second day as the strange owner of the rural town’s iron industry in Manglehorn, filmed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best performance should not miss it - but does the artist of Pacino's format need prices?
Perhaps he is the greatest satisfaction of the audience, and of the Italian especially, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly reports to the land from which his grandparents came.
Points for Italy
After all, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first image of Birdman rewarded with a long applause.
The Calabrian Mob is viewed in it by the view of family relations between clans, who are fighting for power and money, and the director has been able to reconcile all the assumptions for a good movie: quality script, camera, music and actor.
He also captured the chamber psychosquiller Hunger Heart, who filmed Saverio Costanza with Aboru Rohrvacher in the role of a woman who would almost lose her own child by her miserable anxiety.
On the contrary, the French competition film did not expect a warm reception either the Redeemer for fame, nor a 3 heart, of both works extolling on the traditional model of consumer films that rely on the popularity of the acting representatives.
But after all, two really excellent films, i.e. Birdman and Black Soul, are not so few at the first half of the festival.
And even though the festival's films have all the depressive topics, the new film by Peter Bogdanovich, called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy listed in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of American game of the 40s, has been able to cheer up for more than one day.
Police officers caught four producers of pervitine in Prague, drugs vehicles from Poland
"The detectives detained three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a twenty-five-year-old woman who from November to August this year produced and sold drugs of pervitins in Prague 9," said police spokesman Jan Rössler.
First, on Tuesday, August 12th, a unit of intervention in the Cihlárská Street caught a two-four-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who, in the group, acted as a purchaser of drugs in Poland and a salesman’s dose.
The following day, the detectives were detained on the basis of the prior consent of the prosecutor of another member of the group, a seven-year-old man.
The last of the four police officers took place in the mid-morning hours of August 20th in the area of the small-scale incinerator," the speaker described.
For the transport of medicines from Poland, a woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of influence.
In a workshop in the summer area, in a garden house in Horoměřice, in a apartment in Konevova street and in other places in Prague 9 produced pervitin, provided various supplies and chemicals needed for its production and provided transportation of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
Next, he weighed the drug he produced, divided into plastic bags, and then sold the pervitin.
With the transport of drugs from Poland or the sale of narcotics, he had been assisted by a 25 - year - old, unpunished woman.
For this she received a reward from the organiser in the form of a third of the drugs produced," Rössler added.
The criminals also carried out several home visits on the basis of a judge's order, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, paybags, syringes, hoses and other supplies and objects that, according to experts, can be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer's been punished seven times since 1995.
"From the records available, the police found that since 1995, the chief organizer had been prosecuted seven times for property crime, and the woman was not punished," the policeman added.
The latter was held in 2006 on parole for the offence of sexual abuse and the 7-year-old auto mechanics, who has been on trial, have been sentenced nine times since 2009.
Even with him, it was mostly for property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illegal production and other handling of stunning and psychotropic substances and poisons, which threatens them to be imprisoned for up to a decade.
In three persons, the investigator eventually submitted an appeal to the State's representative to the motion for a detention where the judge eventually placed them," the speaker said.
The fourth accused, a 7-year-old recidivist, ended up free.
His position and role in this case were not as important as in the case of the other accused.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products at very "interesting" prices.
For example, handmade chess with a board size of 42 x 42 cm is used in Italy.
If you like, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is 43,405 CZK.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red lacquered figures in a wooden box covered with carbon fibres.
I don't think it's surprising that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of climbing a horse.
If the chess doesn't seem like a good enough gift, there's also a Ferrari model 500 F2 made (of course manually) in scale 1:1,8.
The price of this toy is CZK 318,305.
Breaking up high school and high school doesn't make sense.
In addition, few general educated people and statistics show that gymnasts have good application.
The start of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools over the last 14 days.
Most of the time, it's routine stuff, like taking the flowers from the summer warehouse back to the classrooms and sucking the chalk.
They're going to have a little bit bigger frmol on the mountain gymnasium.
A few days before the beginning of the season, furniture, computers, and other technical equipment and literature are being sought in the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, a four-year gymnasium in Horace after three years of opening and renewing his activities.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of founders to do so.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering the MSMT-controlled school register.
"French Socialists should shut up and put France in order," says Francoise Hollanda's key ally
Valls calls on a strongly fragmented left to "show her support" to a war-ridden socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet with the approval of the majority of French people.
The President deserves universal respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said and raised his applause.
As a humble gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week despite the passionate arguments of Emmanuel Macron, the new minister of finance, who proposed at the beginning of the week to relax the rules.
On Saturday, Holland asked the Socialists to remain "coherent" with the government.
Christian Taubirová, Minister of Justice, however, gave him a line over the budget when she appeared at a meeting of the rebel Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for losing faith in the future because of her "Frances lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Penová, a leader of extremely conservative rights, laughed at the constant internal disputes between socialists when she said she did not assume that the new Walls government would last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls also. They were forced to build a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
She repeated her call to dissolve Parliament and said she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in March municipal elections and, in May, extremely conservative rights succeeded in elections to the European Parliament.
According to a survey by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of being divided into several rival factions before the end of the Dutch term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon have patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art in Prague no longer limited to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved up to the new leadership of the capital.
From the streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal elections of another hernia and the city will not limit street art.
There won't be a limit to dogs getting out.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees in October.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by the current management of the city, to which the mandate ends in a few weeks," said Councilman Lukaš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several councils, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel gambling on its territory.
But the games won't go away, the gambling bill won't change yet.
It's the task of the city's new leadership after the election.
Now we would not be technically able to do so, for example, given the time frame for submitting comments and so on," Manhart explained.
He added that the final negotiations of the current representativeship, which must approve the amendment of the decree, will take place on 11 September.
A referendum on the general ban on gambling is being held on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
The ban on gambling currently applies, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not be changed for the same reason, even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
In particular, Prague 1 is complaining about this, which has already sent the magistrate a proposal of places for which she would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Angel.
The decree regulating the outing of the dogs of the city is set up for several months, so far it's not finished.
The location of herens and the problem of busking solves city decrees.
Only the representative of the capital may issue them or edit them.
The councillors have only an advisory voice, they can't issue the decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed a victory for the scotch independence proponents at their hands.
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake a third time when she almost placed on billboards across Scotland the question of whether they wanted to be rich.
But you won't get to the hearts of the Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor will you get their respect when you threaten them.
The moral of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, although few Scottish people still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to drive shifters out of the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
Chief of Scottish Nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore repeatedly asked his opponent, Unionist Darling, in a television discussion, whether he is willing to respect the "supervised will of the Scottish people" if the Scottish voters vote for independence and start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between the Scottish civil society and the London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a shimas.
Of course Darling doesn't support the Scottish voter mandate.
However, the discussion of Scotland’s currency has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates the Scottish voters is the fairness, the job opportunities and defence of public health that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London’s banker in the matter of currency and also raised the impression that he would not protest the privatisation of health care.
Like Salmond said, "he went to bed with conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Each Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
That was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not only to the voters but to the "boss" association, to the Confederation of the British Industry.
It is beginning to be clear that Cameron's refusal to debate his independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Union's campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee domestic.
They'd respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's causing him almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots are not to jump out and have to accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
The pessimistic beginning of the school according to Miloš Urbana
Illustration to the story Longest Year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The end was the best of vacations, the last week that went nowhere, and we just rolled around and cheered with a grandmother's summer, quiet before the storm, quiet before the stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the quick arrows, already stunned, slinging round the mountain around the Imperial to the back behind the Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, no more heat, the sun smoothed the back and shoulders, knocked the rays to the farewell.
The evening is a slight nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleeping till 11:30, in a week it will be worse, the moments before sleep will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then in the morning it will wake up at 6:30.
He'll be here Monday.
Most of the time it's not raining, on the contrary, the summer is maliciously snooping in front of school.
It's the school, ZDŠ A.
A cobbler with a wildly pink plaster, and before her old familiar faces even a couple new, boys tighter, girls more titty.
There are ugly people out there, avoiding them, it's just as interesting as they hold together and how soon they're here.
And these grown-ups looking girls who came screaming, they're laughing at something hysterical right now, they've probably changed something in their holiday life, while everything's on me at the old one.
And the new champions, some nervous and other delights, why do they come here at all?
Because they have to, the educational war is compulsory.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolboy with the mop, unfortunately, still the same as the student's lending the key to the tin box, where the textbooks can be left, and which is still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of dress stays in mind, now it's not going to last, it's well-winded, but it's going to be worse in a week.
It's just from that idea that the stomach's starting to boil and it's starting to hurt your head.
A head that is even worse to learn from mathematics, the devil's game for the chosen among whom I don't belong, and I never will.
Again, the threes and fours, don't deejay fives, hide from testing, fall into the bench, and dry up, be there and not be, exist only as a name in the classroom and dream stories of nicer girls and prettier buildings, about antennas in the universe where no one has any trouble, no one is humiliated and no one's feet are missing.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's just day one, now it's like years ago.
She let her daughter die.
She is threatened with exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in a public bathroom in the bus station in Jihlava.
Without help, a little girl was born, who, after cutting her belly, wrapped in a blanket, hid under a jacket, and carried to a roadside trailer, where she put her in the bushes tens of metres away from the road.
She gave birth on her way to school.
It came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom on the bus, and I had a baby there.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with the scissors I wore to school," she described the defendant and said she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The following day she returned to the place, put the baby's body in her backpack and took the body out of her backpack, wrapped it in a black needle bag and hid it and left it under the stairwell in her grandmother's house in Havlíček Broda," it stands in the lawsuit with the fact that it's not quite obvious when the baby died.
It could have been in ten minutes, but it could have been a few hours after birth, suffocated by covering the blanket or by putting it under a jacket, cooling or bleeding out of an unsuspected umbilical cord.
The similar scenario was repeated next spring.
A woman in the vicinity of the undetected period from February to April 12th, when the child's corpse was found by random witnesses under a shrub at a pond in Havelíčkobrod, she gave birth herself secretly.
This time in the basement bathroom in the family house.
Without checking whether she was born alive without cutting and fixing the umbilical cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in a few plastic containers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Later in the afternoon, he and his former partner were taken to the pond.
Eventually, a friend turned her in.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of a partner.
Even for that reason, he does not now stand before a court of law, but has been punished for failing against the Funeral Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution was wrong, but it came to me at that moment as a human," did not hide the outrage of the accused, who allegedly succumbed to the man's relationship and feared him.
During her statement, a young woman spoke quite equitably.
Tears in her eyes moved her to the moment when she spoke of a relationship with her parents, from which she left after reaching her age.
She didn't want to kill.
"They follow me every 14 days to visit me, doing everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she exclaimed.
I didn't pick up the equipment because I didn't want the kids, I felt young.
I was gonna put him in a babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain it to you," she answered to the judge.
However, she refused to act with the thought and intention of killing a newborn.
According to her claim, the second child was born dead.
But she didn't stop drinking alcohol in her pregnancy.
But I've narrowed it down.
And she didn't drink hard.
I've also limited smoking," I said.
Although her pregnancy was seen in both cases, she claimed to everyone, even on repeated questions, that she had a health problem, that she was introduced.
And so is a friend.
The main trial will continue on Tuesday in the castle court with statements by court experts.
A judgment could already be rendered on Wednesday.
The woman is at risk of a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison, or an exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching Prestige Cruise's three-billion-dollar repurchase
According to sources familiar with the whole issue, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest ship cruise operator in the world in the Prestige Cruises International Inc. buy negotiations for approximately $3 billion.
Trade by Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion which competes with greater competition of Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has enabled access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and wealthy clients.
The agreement could already be published this week, provided a source on Sunday, but pointed out that negotiations still do not have to end successfully.
Owner Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 % stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources were reluctant to be appointed because negotiations were not public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request for a comment, spokeswoman Apollo refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's income in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced sales of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
In the coming year, the mid-class rise in growing economies such as China and India is expected to benefit from the nine-billion-billion-year flight segment.
Companies are competing for these customers to become preferred options when selecting excursions.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offer in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the closure of the $850 million trade.
Norway Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when there has been a merger with the tour operator Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino companies controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested one billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise.

Chinese authorities provoke prodemocratic activists in Hong Kong the day after the decision to vote
There was a group of loyal people near Beijing who were waving the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress approved only two of the three candidates to participate in the elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the nomination committee, which will probably consist of members of the faithful Beijing.
As a result of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballots and get pro-democratic activists to renew their promise and protect the Hong Kong financial centre of the protest movement “Conclusion of the Centre”.
In Hong Kong, political reform is a major cause of tension, Chinese leaders fear that the requirement for democratisation will extend to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on Chinese official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's commercial district.
The press conference, which will be hosted by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong authorities of China.
During the day several press conferences were also scheduled to be held by the Vice-President of the Standing Committee Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong State Council and Macau Feng Wei.
Student activists said they would meet in front of Hong Kong government's office this afternoon.
In the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to the events, Russian journalists asked Russian President Vladimír Putin on Sunday to stop the Ukrainian government from fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately to start negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of torn areas.
His spokesman, Dmitrij Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated in order for Russian speaking areas to be given the power to protect their rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Government of Kiev to act with the pro-Russian rebels as equals is consistent with a clear strategy that follows from the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help separatists occupy the territory and make the Ukrainian government grant a real independence to the newly declared New Zealand so that instead of joining the West can connect with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of state television Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to reclaim the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April were controlled by separatists after Moscow adopted the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on 18 March.
Kremlin and separatists of the recently occupied territory marked “Novorusko” or “New Russia”, a term referring to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words that everyone who believes that there are peace talks on the horizon is a prisoner, because Ukrainian politicians started the campaign before the 26th of October, while the government forces are attacking civilians in areas controlled by separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately initiate meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of the company and on the statute of the state sovereignty of the southeastern Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's hint at State sovereignty was thought of in the context of a broader autonomy, which has been under discussion with the leadership of Kyev for several months and is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas of cultural and linguistic rights threats.
Peskov stated that only the Ukrainian government could grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern region.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The introduction of the speaker Kremlin, who was to correct the ‘inappropriate interpretation’ of Putin's notes, stressed the approach of Russia's leadership to address the rise of separatists in the east, which is different from the open planting of Crimea, where most of the two million people are of ethnic origin.
Moscow should also carry out much more difficulties in polling Doneck and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russian and public opinion surveys that have taken place before the conflict have shown broad support for detention in Ukraine.
The autonomy of Russian diplomats at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations and, in essence, to give Kremlin real control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was received five months ago, is the seat of the main Russian sea fleet, maritime commercial background and historic coastal resorts.
Areas between Russian Rostov and Crimea are also the center of the mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
During his opening speech of 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give different regions more control over their finances and language statutes.
However, this vision of autonomy differs considerably from the vision of Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's last call for Kyev to act as a separatist on an equal footing followed the next rebel procedure last week after Russian troops and tanks penetrated eastern Ukraine from the former calm area along the Asian sea.
The Russian separatists have taken control of Novoazovsk by such a force that the Ukrainian security authorities are concerned that it is a draw to occupy strategic coastal areas only in Crimea.
This has led to a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with a metallurgy combination of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate of the Crimea Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poženko took part in a meeting of the leading representatives of the European Union in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
“We are approaching a point from which there is no return,” warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday, told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two colonies of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units entered the Doněčká region last week to support siege separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovajsk during the Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday for 10 Russian prisoners captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, said Lysenko on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the scandal of unveiled photos
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancées Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after in the biggest hacked photograph scandal the celebrity got on the Internet series of explicit photos of the naked Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker says he has 60 naked photos of Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, Rihanny singer, Ariana Grande and Ley Michelle and Kirsten Dunst actresses.
Personal pictures of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko were reportedly also made public because of the escape from iCloud.
The list contains 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who asked for his hand last month, said to Confidential magazine: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and extended to the public.
Greece, now in New York City, reports online news reports that hacking is “indignant” and those who have become its target“ seem to be humiliated.
He thinks that the hacker got 30 pictures of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures that he's on without blowing up at the pool.
Palmerová, for example, acted in a film called Love and Honor, where she was named Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of Chuck Strahovski's TV series and the actress from the tracker Sucker Punch Browning didn't comment yesterday on the stolen images.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said, "It's a clear violation of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen hacker, on his twitter, criticized: “To publish pictures of hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.
From a legal point of view, the disclosure of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigmy footballers made Lebra comfortable, even without winning.
Olomouc - The thunders and lightning that the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigmy Joseph Lébr sent to his subordinate last week are, it seems, past.
Even if they brought in only a point from Opava for a non-stop drawbar.
After all, they've made a little bit of a comfortable by planting and fighting the club's boss.
The payout money could be coming to the club soon.
"I'm going to have one more game, as I mentioned last week, but I'm much more optimistic," said Lébr, despite Sigma's failure to win, the players convinced him with improved performance.
The fighting and deployment that we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive that he won't win.
If we'd played this game from the beginning of the season, I'm sure we haven't lost yet," Lebra thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial home pressure, then the game evenled and in the second half it was better.
After the victory, Kalvod's men took a toll, but they couldn't get to the goal, so they couldn't win.
The result, however, is not according to our ideas.
But we lacked only one change of chance to be fully satisfied," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the approach of footballers caused only his threat.
There were definitely more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the coach's side or the fans' side," said Lébr.
With pressure Sigma must count
After the game in Opava last week, the players were not too happy to comment.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to admit it," the young goalkeeper Michal Reich shook his head.
Without a comment, he then left a question about Lebro's statement from last week's attacker Václav Yours, who did not change Sigma's greatest opportunity in the Saturday game.
After all, there was just a little talk about pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody's trying to pull on us.
Today, we've shown that if we fight and drive all our asses, that's what we're gonna do," he said.
They Take Warning to the Heart
Even Leoš Kalvoda's coach did not deny that preparing for the game was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and today it was clear that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't about them not wanting to fight and rebuff," said the phantom coach.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us to deal with the hardness and to realize what the other league was about.
It's not just about football, it's about fighting," Kalvoda said.
It's not much to hope that Sigma will work from the beginning in the next games.
"I'd really like to believe it," he added.
